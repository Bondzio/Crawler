                "Text": "If you are familiar with Orson Scott Card's Hatrack River site, you know that there is nobody in the field of science fiction and fantasy who is more committed to helping new writers. If that is news to you then certainly his resume as a writer is well known to any one interested in writing in this field. This is one of the thinner books on writing you are going to fine and that is because Uncle Orson is extremely focused in explaining his craft. Consequently, there are but five sections to this volume in The Writer's Digest Genre Writing Series. (1) The Infinite Boundary looks at the spectrum covered by science fiction and fantasy with some attention to the distictions between the two as well. (2) World Creation details how to build, populate and dramatize your new world, including working out all the necessary elements such as history, language, geography and customs. (3) Story Construction deals with finding the right character for an idea or the right idea for a character (and do not forget about \"the MICE quotient\"). (4) Writing Well is a collection of fundamental tips, otherwise known as the \"don't do this at home\" section. (5) The Life and Business of Writing deals both generally with the business but also the specifics of science fiction and fantasy. I find his use of examples, especially when he lays out a series of variations on a theme, to be helpful because they demonstrate in practice what his theoretical points and show how many additional ideas each idea generates. Perhaps most importantly, Uncle Orson is having a conversation with you; he is neither lecturing nor pontificating. His non-fiction is as readily as his award-winning fiction, and that should come as a surprise to no one. There are other books better suited to getting into the nuts and bolts of constructing brave new worlds, but I have yet to find a better book at covering the basics than this one."

                "Text": "A wonderful book!  In it, Card adresses some of the key issues addressing  writers in the speculative fiction field. In the first few pages of this  book, Card explains he does not intend this to be a book about writing, in  general.  Rather, it is a book about writing Science Fiction and Fantasy,  in particular.  Things like viewpoint, theme, etc. that writers of every  genre need to cover are not addressed.  So if the book seems lacking  in  that area, that's the reason. That said, there are some wonderful tips for  SF writers, both technical and practical, both for writing and being a  writer.  For instance, should a SF writer get an agent first, or send books  to a publisher first?  Card gives his answer, and it's different than other  genres.  Also, he explains how to use a Wise Reader to handle problems with  exposition.  Full of interesting anecdotes, useful tips, and valuable  guidelines, this has remained one of the textbooks of the field."

Generally I object to \"how-to-write\" books for a variety of reasons, but this is a book that breaks my general rule.  Card gives general sound advice with examples, lists the biggest  \"do nots\" that he's run into, sets some straight-forward methods  of submissions -- and most importantly gives some honest encouragement for  new writers.  If your book is good enough, it will get published.  The  proof is in the pudding -- I sold my very first book after reading this  one, which is, after all, the true test of books on writing."

Orson Scott Card focuses on Science fiction mostly, but showes distinct differences between the TWO genres. I would have liked a separate book for fantasy, instead of both tegether, but Card does not add Fantasy as an afterthought. He explains both in detail, and shows how to write well for both audiences. He uses a small assortment of books as examples, including J.R.R. Tolkein's \"The Lord of the Rings\", and Octavia Butler's \"Wild Seed.\" Over all I would definitely recommend this book to writers of either genre."

                "Text": "...you must read this. This short book was actually a pleasant surprise to me. While reading it I felt as if I was talking to Card one on one. The book provides very valuable advice on writing, ideas, and tips on how to break into the field. This book was more than I expected, because it offers more than tips on how to write...it gives you an insight to Card's mind and his creative process. Which hopefully will provide you with assurance that you are on the right path, and the motivation to pursue it."
