The reason I am only giving it three stars is because it did not feel like a full novel, more like filler or a short story that is long ( if that makes sense).  I love the sisters stories and wait for them so it was a bit of a let down.  Also, the \" who is going to inheret\" is getting dragged on.  I will keep reading the stories but really hope the next has more substance.  For a lazy afternoon read it is not bad."
