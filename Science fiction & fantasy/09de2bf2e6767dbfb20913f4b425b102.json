                "Text": "The Winter Sea is wonderful. It is exactly the kind of historical fiction that I love reading. The story is about a writer in the present time who travels to Scotland and stays at a cottage in Cruden Bay (between Aberdeen and Edinburgh) near Slain Castle to research materials for her novel about the Jacobite uprising of 1708. (King James (Catholic) was exiled from the English throne to France when Mary and William became King and Queen (Mary was James' daughter) at the request of the English people. King James died in France in 1700, but his son James (aka The Pretender) with the help of the French King invaded Scotland to try to reclaim the crown.) This was the period of the first Jacobite uprising, historical materials for which are hard to come by, as there were many cover-ups, betrayals, etc. Ms. Kearsley gets better with each book she writes. I was reminded pleasantly of Lady Dorothy Dunnett's writing style in which fictional characters are interwoven with real people and events. This book was so much like Lady Dunnett's Checkmate, her six book of the Lymond Chronicles, except that Kearsley is so much easier to read. I loved this book."

Some of my favorite books being, West With the Night, by Beryl Markham; Sena Jeter Nashlund's, Ahab's Wife, One Thousand White Women by Jim Fergus, Outlander by Diana Gabaldon; The Red Tent, Cutting for Stone, The Help, Sarah's Key I could keep going but you can tell the kind of books I like from that sampling.  Well I have never been so emotionally involved in a book like I was with Winter Sea.  I can hardly find words to tell what a fantastic read this was.  All I can say, and I do love to write myself, is that I wish I could tell a story the way Susanna Kearsley does!"

Hard to put down and the ending was absolutely perfect. Nice to read a book that is romantic, captivating, and intersting without needing the use of sex, violence, or foul language.

I thought the premise of an author writing a historical novel becoming the novel was well... a novel idea. I thoroughly enjoyed this book with the setting and characters especially. The only reason for not the full 5 starts was the sometimes long historical infill. At times it did feel like a history lesson. Good story, well written, well thought out and that is much appreciated!"
