I was somewhat skeptical as I began reading, but was quickly drawn in.  It has all the elements of an excellent novel.  The characters are well defined, believable and easy to relate to.  The plot, however fictitious, is grounded in reality and calls attention to a truly catastrophic, yet largely ignored threat to international security.  The plot and pacing are first rate, as the story never dragged or failed to hold my interest.  More importantly, it made me *care* about the people and events as I read.  Ray Gorham has done an outstanding job in researching and writing this novel.", "Helpfulness": 0.9379310344827586, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3IXQ9EEZMP1GI/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #6,563,941", "Helpfulness": "94%", "Name": "Subie", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on February 1, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9174311926605505, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3DM9300IR3FXZ/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #1,773,857", "Helpfulness": "79%", "Name": "Matthew Sheldon", "Location": "Cambridge, MA USA"}}, {"Date": "on June 12, 2011", "Text": "I think we have talent here.  From the Forward I was hooked. The idea of an EMP never crossed my mind and it made the story line believable.  What better way to hold your interest than to have two people deeply attached to each other trying desperately to get back together after a major event changes all the circumstances of their separation.  All the subplots fit tightly especially Doug. The experiences that Kyle had as he tried to get back to Montana were very real.  There were no slow spots in the storyline.

I have been on a post-apocalyptic reading jag for a while now, and this novel is in the middle of the pack for me. It moves right along, contains only a few errors (wretch when author means retch, as in to dry heave, strait when the author means straight, as in straight hair.) Having read more than a few novels which clearly hadn't been edited, read aloud by the author, or even run through a spell-checker, I appreciate what I used to take for granted in a novel - that I wouldn't be bumped out of it constantly by blatant errors in spelling, punctuation, formatting, etc. There are several pretty decent plain language explanations of how an EMP creates the destruction that it does, which are helpful to anybody who doesn't understand it to begin with. SPOILER ALERT:I will say that I was never in any real doubt that Kyle would make it home. It would have been a nice twist if he had frozen to death and Rose had found his journal and some months or years later it had gotten to Jenn. Not nice in the sense that it would have been a nice outcome for the character, but nice in the sense that the reader's expectations have been upended, and now they really need to pay attention because they don't know what's coming next. But a tidy little novel, a happy ending, nice motivation to prepare for the unexpected if you haven't yet begun to do so. For me, the best post-EMP novel remains One Second After. But this novel is worth the $3.99 Kindle price if you enjoy these types of stories. I would encourage the author to make his next novel more complex, and include more of the challenges any community would face after an EMP event. He alluded to the better prepared people in Deer Creek not participating in the council, leaving people in need with not much to give to try to figure things out. This really could have been a source for a lot of juicy conflict. Does the council send emissaries to ask these better-prepared people for help? What kind of reception do they receive? What is the response, the rationale for either helping or not? I'm giving this novel three stars; I'd give One Second After four stars, and save five stars for Cormac McCarthy's The Road.", "Helpfulness": 0.8055555555555556, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Q1IMENIWPFZJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #2,128,661", "Helpfulness": "77%", "Name": "Anonymous", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on July 13, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7636363636363637, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3ANK3VYPWVCOK/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #608,128", "Helpfulness": "75%", "Name": "Amazon Customer", "Location": "ON, Canada"}}, {"Date": "on August 2, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7906976744186046, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2V436XK9BESEE/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "#19,528", "Helpfulness": "74%", "Name": "Degas", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on October 27, 2012", "Text": "This is a great idea looking for a good writer.
