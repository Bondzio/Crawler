If she was 26 when finishing her architecture degree, then meet, married and began having children, a 9yo, and a 17yo. So how many years breeding does she have left? So she's around 43yo and already 2 months pregnant with her husband child. They better get busy because that's the late side of getting pregnant.  Maybe use math in the next book.
