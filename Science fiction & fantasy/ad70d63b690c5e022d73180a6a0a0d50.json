The book reads like two tales in one, it begins as an apocalyptic end-of-the-world story that turns suddenly into an alien invasion plot halfway through. I found the two main characters interesting enough that I didn't get that feeling one sometimes gets with divergent plotlines based on multiple characters, where you lose the flow of the story when the perspective switches from one character to another. The buildup to the two main characters meeting was so drawn out that it was a bit of an anticlimax when they finally joined up. I often found myself thinking, \"I wouldn't have done that in that situation,\" which told me I was getting drawn into the plot. Often the characters themselves would later comment on a foolish decision they had made, in a way that made it believable why they had taken that action at the time. I found Walt's nihilism a bit off-putting at first, though ultimately I ended up rooting for him as the author kept throwing disasters in his path. His transformation into an action hero was a bit jarring, but I thought that the author delivered with an ending that resolved the various threads he'd set up. I also liked how the two main characters were set off each other, one seeking oblivion, the other just trying to keep himself and his wife alive.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A10BLMM5EFVH4N/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #2,384,496", "Helpfulness": "85%", "Name": "Kenneth Mcdonald", "Location": "Sacramento, CA USA"}}, {"Date": "on December 31, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8333333333333334, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3QR2T1HKUCVZH/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #2,154,803", "Helpfulness": "89%", "Name": "Amazon Customer", "Location": "Camarillo, CA, United States"}}, {"Date": "on August 5, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24YBXREJDUU6Q/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #9,644,954", "Helpfulness": "88%", "Name": "GraciJ", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on April 14, 2014", "Text": "I found this book enjoyable.

What I didn't expect was to be sucked in from page one.  This was one of those \"couldn't put it down\" books for me.  I think the author stayed focused on his goals through the entire book, and it showed.  I found the plot to be tight and well-paced.  I appreciated the alternating between Walt and Raymond's points of view as well as the different ways they handled and moved forward with the disaster.  But even with the limited POV, the side characters were always well-developed and meaningful to the story.  Never did an event, action, character, or location feel gratuitous, as if it were thrown in there for no real reason.  Every bit of this book felt intentional and planned, there was obviously a great deal of thought and effort put into the story outside of the actual writing.

Maybe it's my fault and I didn't read the entire description of the book prior to buying it, but I bought it thinking it was an apocalyptic book about a pandemic that wiped out the majority of the planet.  The first part of the book did a great job explaining the spread of the virus/whatever and told a great story from two different parts of the country.  I immediately liked it because one part of the story had a couple choosing to \"survive\" in place, by defending and prepping in a house.  The other part of the story had another guy \"surviving\" on the move, making his way from the east coast of the USA to the west.  SPOILER ALERT:  Needless to say, the book took a massive downward fall when it is revealed that aliens infected the planet and were now \"conquering\" the planet.  It gets pretty far-fetched after that revelation.  Had I read that it was an alien-apocalypse I wouldn't have bought it.  If you're into that kind of thing, it's a decent read.
