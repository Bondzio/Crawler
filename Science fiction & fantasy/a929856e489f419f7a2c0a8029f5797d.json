I orderd the boxed set and was impressed with the updated look of the covers of these stories.  The stories are still awesome even if they are a little dated.  Wells is considered one of the fathers of science fiction writing.  The stories still hold up great today.  Order this boxed set.  You won't be disappointed.  My non-reader of a son enjoyed the first story so much he read two more.  I loved that!"
