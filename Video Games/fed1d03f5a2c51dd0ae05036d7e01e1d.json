Goalkeepers are Gods! Although what YOU can do seems more realistic than previous iterations.The Brazilian league is missing but that's business I can't knock either side for holding on to their bargaining position. The graphics are still good. Researching players is still annoying (send a scout out and in a couple months I guess we leaves the paperwork on the sidewalk like a high school) I haven't played online yet because I bought an expensive version and wasted a lot of bonuses. The learning curve is hard for a casual gamer like me."
