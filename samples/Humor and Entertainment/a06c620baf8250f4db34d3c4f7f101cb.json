                "Text": "The Savage Caves by T.H. Lain is a quick and fun return to what gaming should be and can be. Lain does an excellent job of giving the reader a solid little story that has re-kindled my intrest in gaming. The characters (based on D&D; 3rd's ICON Characters) are fleshed out and stay true to the character class they represent. Now I am not going to say that this new series is Dragonlance or The Forgotten Realms, its a little stripped down. But thats ok. This little novel is action packed and predictable, but its so FUN. The dialog is pretty funny and a bit hokey, but he only had 182 pages. Hopefully as the series continues, Lain will give us a little more seasoning and depth, but for now enjoy a quick fun read. Forget the grand morality plays, let Lain place a torch in your hand and a mace in the other. Explore the Savage Caves, and still be back in time for bed. A good start to a new book line. Looking forward to the Living Dead."

Best points--lots of well written action, original use of giant spiders and some depth added to the much maligned goblin race (usually just used by DM's as sword-fodder). Bad points--too short and lazily written dialogue (kinda like a real game). Series has definite promise."

Yet, as it was probably meant for the teen and younger audience, was completly devoid of the elements that make a great book: character devolpment, intricate plot, etc. Then again, I didn't expect it to. So, if you feel like picking up a book and just reading, go ahead and read this. If you are young, and new to Dungeons and Dragons, go ahead and read this. If you are looking for a top-of-the-line book like R.A. Salvatore's, don't read this."

It was also great because it had mysterious schemes behind the plot that makes you keep reading. The down side to the book is that it can be confusing and a tiny bit boring at times. But other than that it is a great book, you should purchase this book, and trust me it is worth your money."
