I think the photos are a bit strange (the characters don't look like how I expected them to), but she has read it over and over again happily."

                "Text": "Sometimes a picture is not worth a thousand words. First, the graphics are not good, in my estimation. Imagine the artists of the Mary Worth comic strip doing a teen novel. Muddy colors, uninteresting drawings. Best Friend Bess drawn as a 50's pinup. The monsters would have been much scarier imagined. Unlike a good graphic novel (such as Bad Island), in which the sparse dialog allows the reader to fill in the spaces, in this one the story is just cut to the bone and there is no space to envision."
