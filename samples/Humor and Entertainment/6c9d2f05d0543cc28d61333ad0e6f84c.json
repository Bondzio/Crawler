This type of art does not exist anymore. Just go and buy all these wonderful books by Lynd Ward, Frans Masereel, Otto Nuckel, James Reid, et al., which are now available at such great prices! Many Thanks to David A. Berona and the people at these fine publishing companies for continuing to bring such great works of art back to us! Is Ward's \"Song Without Words\" on the horizon?(!)"
