The text seems to be okay, but so far, half way through the first chapter, I have encountered a number of problems with, well, the problems. A variable is listed in the practice section as squared, but when checking the answer it is apparent that it was cubed instead. A plus sign is switched for a minus sign, a number is changed. It does make doing the practice annoying. However, I am still learning and remembering about algebra."
