If you are really interested in this sort of thinking you can make it as long, and as short of a read as you would like to indulge yourself. I took my time and I think it really paid off by the end, a really amazing book from a time before CGI and graphics leaving yourself with your mind, Abbott's imagination, and a square."

After all, a being in flatland finds our three dimensional world as unfathomable as we find multidimensional world. Flatland is a short and simple read but opens mind to fantasy world of no dimension (pointland), one dimension (lineland) and two dimensions (flatland). Author's imaginations conjure up social hierarchy, ruling structure, culture and history of a fictional world forcing the reader to stretch his imaginations. An quick enjoyable stimulating read that will leave you smiling and thinking in the end."

The writer tended to use many run on sentences which made it difficult to follow the thoughts he was trying to convey. It also seemed like he was trying to write along the lines of Shakespeare, but the subject material did not lend creedence to this style. The writing style was also inconsistent. It seemed like someone else wrote the last two sections of the book. This was also the most smooth flowing portion of the book. The enjoyable part of the book was using your imagination to see the different dimensional worlds that were visited in the book."

The creation and description of a two dimensional society in such great detail leaves one full of amazement. The idea of introducing an additional dimension, incomprehensible to people of two dimensional world as an indicator of our own limitations in realizing and recognizing what lies beyond or within our world is very touching. The \"Upward not northward\" notion, that the Square so tried to explain and preach could perhaps best be translated to \"inwards not outwards\" for us in our own world."

However, I found it a bit funny that Amazon asked me to evaluate whether the characters in the book were only one-dimensional, developed, or complex! Indeed, as a book about dimensional creatures, it included both one, two and three dimensional creatures and characters. However, the reader is 'asked' to sympathize with the most developed character of all--the two dimensional one!"
