I think you either like him or not. It could be considered by some to be an acquired taste. I liked this book and happy to have it as it helps with my research. I would recommend to someone not familiar with the works of Charles Fort to keep an open mind while reading it and to keep in mind when it was written. As for me, I am as happy as a witch in a broom factory to have it!"

At least the price was right and it was (unintentionally) amusing in parts but this guy doesn't understand science. He writes as if unexplained phenomena are somehow anathema to science when in fact they are the very stuff that science looks for in order to find new areas to study. The sad thing is that stuff like this used to be considered the lunatic fringe of American non-fiction, if Fort was alive today he would probably be a Fox News host or running for president."
