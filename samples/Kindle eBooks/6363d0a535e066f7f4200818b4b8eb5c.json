It's simply and prudently written, so if I need to be refreshed on a concept, I can easily navigate to it and not spend any time deciphering the text. Unlike another review saying it was simplistic, I find this covers most topics found on the AP exam. It's hard to have too many complaints when the information is accurate and the book is free!"

It starts with discussions of Science and then moves slowly into the meat of the Study.  The explanations are good and I already have a Hard Bound College Text I picked up used I'll move on to when I finish this study.  If you would like to read something to have a basis to build on, this is, in my opinion, a really good place to start.  It is still chemistry, but with each chapter the understanding comes so much easier than my earlier years studying.  I had this digital book added to my library for free, with my Prime Membership.  I like it. A lot!"
