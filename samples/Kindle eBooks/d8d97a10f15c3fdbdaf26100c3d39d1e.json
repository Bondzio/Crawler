                "Text": "As a Title one Math and Reading Teacher I am always looking for ways to help my student enjoy and love math.  The book offers several ways for me to show my students how much fun math can be. The author makes the point that when the number one appears in either the tens column or the units column of a two digit multiplication the arithmetic is greatly simplified in regards to multiplication. Other tricks shown make use of the special properties eleven and nine have. This is the first time I ever opened up a math book to a new chapter and \u201cgot it\" right away.  Great book and Great read."

                "Text": "Amazing insights into simple arithmetic that I have never seen before. The identity property comes alive in this book. It is not the dry topic it was in middle school. The author has a different perspective on math, seems to come at it from a different angle than all the teachers you had previously. If math always turned you off, take a chance on this book. The author may just change your mind about the topic."
