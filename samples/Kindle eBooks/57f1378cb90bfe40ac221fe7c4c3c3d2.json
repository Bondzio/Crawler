The tips and strategies contained within this book are sure to aid anyone who is struggling with debt, or indeed anyone looking to stay out of debt. I really enjoyed the fact that the author went into the mindset and psychology of getting out of debt rather than just providing some financial advice. A really helpful book for anyone looking to get out of debt."
