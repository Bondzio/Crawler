In addition to being terrifying and loaded with vivid imagery, this book was just as well-written as it was addictive. Seriously, once I started this book I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Overall, this is an amazing book and I definitely look forward to reading more by this author in the future."

This will keep the vision of it in the back of your mind on a daily basis, and help you be conscious of your actions. It's a short story of a man's journey to hell and back, that is so terrifying, you will never want to go. I found this to be both an entertaining read, but it also had a positive influence on my day to day life. Great read!"
