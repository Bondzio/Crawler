This book really opened my eyes to what could happen how Jesus does work in very special ways.  The author does an amazing way of telling the story but also making sure you connect wight the book in your own ways. I would definitely encourage any one who is stumbling in there faith or wants to reassure it to read this book."

The author paints a really clear picture of Jesus through his conversation with Michael, the main character. Though it is presented kind of like a story, Jesus's conversation with Michael is packed full of wisdom. It will certainly help you think about life in a different way, and this book is truly uplifting."

I was being totally transformed to image of Jesus as Michael communed with him. Congrats to Ivan King for contextualizing and painting such a clear image of Christ! A must read!"
