                "Text": "This is a great review of the history of organic chemistry from the civil war to the 1920's. Author places many significiant discoveries, in a proper position in terms of value to society and the influence that the particular item had in changing such society. Although these advancements influenced the politics of the day, the topic is not addressed, thus leaving an easier read to understand the actual chemistry."
