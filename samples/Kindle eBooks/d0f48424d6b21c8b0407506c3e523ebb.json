It has 1,001 practice questions and problems (with answers, of course), and you can access them online, too. The book does NOT have any \"lessons\" or even introductory material for each chapter, but plunges right into the questions. It is meant to be a companion to Chemistry for Dummies or any chemistry course. It is a great way to practice for exams. When I took chemistry, I did tons of extra problems and it helped me tremendously. Not sure why a periodic table and certain other chemistry basics aren't included, but like I said, it is a companion book, and not designed to be used as a chemistry textbook."

This is not an all-inclusive text for everything Chemistry; it's a great primer to introduce a student to the basics. Enjoyable, at that."
