                "Text": "the title leads one to believe that the book will have info on macro and micronutrients, and how they are used in the body. i was expecting a good review of the krebbs cycle and the electron transport chain, and instead i got a mishmash of the author's opinions on how food tastes and on the superiority of vegetarianism over \"flesh-eating.\" i was extremely disappointed by this thinly veiled attempt at passing this unorganized piece of persuasive writing off as being purely educational."
