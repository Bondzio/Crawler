It's the worst FIFA to date. Absolutely horrible. Everything is broken now. The worst part is the defending and shooting. You would think a company that made over $1B in FUT would actually do things right. They usually release a glitchy buggy version and fix it a few months down the road. If only I was a billionaire I would destroy EA. I took the blue pill but you sheep continue to play this trash of a game and give them your money."

But for some reason, every single tactic that was working for me and gave me so much success is being offset by the horrible reaction time and \"realistic\" engine this game is instilling. Mind you, there was a time where i could win by two or three goals but now I have gotten into a horrible funky form. If you want a great quality FIFA game, go back to 13 or 14 on the ps3. Nothing good comes out of this game!!!!"
