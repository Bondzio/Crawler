But I discovered that was because I hadn't read \"Bowl of Heaven\" and didn't realize \"Shipstar\" was part two of the story. I'm glad I kept reading it and in the end I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it so much that now I've purchased \"The Bowl of Heaven\" to read and the Whispersynch connected audio. There seem to be people who really haven't liked either book. I'm not one of them. Read \"Shipstar\", but only after you've read \"Bowl of Heaven\"."

As said, the story is interesting (albeit despite attempts to separate the 'bowl' from the Ringworld, there are many similarities in structure) and the ideas involved are original and interesting, but the way it's written - especially the flow at the end - makes things begin not to make sense (and  the techno-babble which in my opinion also increases greatly towards the end, compounds that).That's a 3 1/2 Star above.Good enough to read, but could have been a whole lot better."

The character development isn't really the primary motive here.  Though I thought the characters were developed just fine. Beware of some hinted at spoilers:  The idea that these \"Folk\", ancient Bird beings from a familiar planet, have the ability to stay in their \"Overmind\",  accessing their \"Undermind\" only when necessary gives them a superiority over ordinary mish-mash Human consciousness (consciousness / unconsciousness working in tandem) is an interesting contest.  And the reader will see who wins out.  I totally loved exploring , well the characters running for their lives, the underground superstructures and rail way tunnels at supersonic speed,  almost reminiscent of Clarke's \"Rendezvous with Rama\".  Super great fun!  period."

The star is manipulated by mirrors and magnets to produce a jet, thus making the bowl and star a ship, just one far bigger than worlds.  Learn of the birdfolk's \"great shame\" and find out who really runs the shipstar.  Larry Niven has been a favorite of mine since junior high---I know he's \"getting up there\" in years, but I hope he keeps writing stories.  Just maybe \"boosterspice\" will be invented in time.  Gregory Benford has written lots of good stuff as well, though I didn't \"discover\" him till much later in life."

This book is a frightening look at very alien concepts. When thinking about how big the universe is and how small the Earth is, it helps to make you feel even smaller. A lot of the concepts sound like an echo of the Uplift series and other Sci-Fi series, but adds a sense of desperation that is so much more prevalent. You don't just sense the immensity and desperation, you feel it in your bones."
