From the moment Cassidy is on the plane, the author takes us through numerous lives who are connected with her but still trying to put all the pieces together.  Devin appears weak at first but when he needs to step up he takes charge trying to help get free a boy from horrible people who then sell him into slavery.  Tess is a strong woman but also shows her feminine side when talking about her marine boyfriend and they plan on marrying someday."

This Chancellor wants to breed with Lori since she's just so damn perfect, but my question is how old is she? If she was 26 when finishing her architecture degree, then meet, married and began having children, a 9yo, and a 17yo. So how many years breeding does she have left? So she's around 43yo and already 2 months pregnant with her husband child. They better get busy because that's the late side of getting pregnant.  Maybe use math in the next book.  Look out IVF treatments, cause looks like Lori will be getting treatments often."

You can totally tell the story is written by a guy. Mr. VANCE, I want to thank you for inventing characters that are more like real people, complex and unpredictable. It is also noteworthy that you are taking on a difficult style of telling several stories at once.  Finally, I couldn't help but notice you prose improving as the story unfolds. Keep it up, great start."

I got hooked initially, but before I was halfway done I really wanted to stop reading it. But, I forced myself to read it till the end, and I wish I hadn't. The chronology I think is what made me the most angry. A character is on her deathbed due to a severely infected wound, and two hours later after 1 antibiotic pill she's 100% better. C'mon. And, the dog plays a huge role in the beginning, and three quarters in you're wondering if he's even part of the crew anymore. Ugh. Don't waste your time. I wish I hadn't."

                "Text": "The Death by John W. Vance is a thrilling post-apocalyptic story about a pandemic that sweeps away 90% of the living. What the few survivors have left to deal with makes them wish they too were that lucky. This is a fast-paced thriller with real plausible characters and a plot line that holds you riveted. I can't wait for the next one. John Vance is an author to watch. I highly recommend this series."
