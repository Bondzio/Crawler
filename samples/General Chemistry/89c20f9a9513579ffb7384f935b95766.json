While I appreciate the good intentions, this book quickly left me behind. It immediately uses jargon without first defining the terms. Also, when it does attempt to provide definitions, the definitions themselves use terms that haven't been defined. I was hoping that things would clear up for me as I progressed through the book, but unfortunately, I continued to be disappointed. As a result, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere in my search for chemistry knowledge."

The humor helped make the material easy to remember, however.  I was a chemistry major, and when my teenage daughter started H.S. chemistry this year, I thought I should brush up on it myself, in case she needed help.  While looking for a good intro textbook, I found this title and got it for her.  I read it myself first, of course, and it was as good as the genetics book was.  Mr. Gonick teams up with a professional, in this case a college professor who teaches environmental chemistry, and makes him/her the cartoon host of the story.  I may have to get the updated edition of \"The Cartoon Guide to Genetics\" next."
