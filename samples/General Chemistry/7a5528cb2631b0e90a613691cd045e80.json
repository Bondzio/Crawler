                "Text": "This book is extremely helpful to study from. You get to practice all types of Regents problems. Regent Chemistry questions are usually repetitive. It won't be the same exact question but it will be very similar. The Regents curve is horrible so if you're planning to do well, you better know how to do all the problems. For example, I got a 96 and only got 2 questions wrong. So just know your stuff and know how to do every problem in this book and you're set."
