While this is not a textbook, do not expect to simply passively read this, there are places where the reader will be well rewarded by breaking out pencil and paper and working through the explanations.  Core Rope memory in particualar is a tricky concept to work out, but exquisitely ingeniuos once the reader does savvy it.  Very nicely written and informative."

Its amazing what NASA did with the technology of the day. This book makes a great gift for any NASA buff. It also makes a great history book too! I can't put this book down!"
