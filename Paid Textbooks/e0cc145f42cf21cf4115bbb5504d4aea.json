Its ten lessons are intended for the general reader who wants to know how math is done, but has little prior math knowledge. A lively format and explanations make for a readable survey of basic math principles and aesthetics perfect for those who would appreciate an easy, lively overview. Any general lending library will want this."

I would give it five stars, but recently, while rereading it. I decided to get the Kindle version so I could read it on my tablet. That was a mistake. The equations are in the form of graphics so small as to be nearly unreadable. I am very disappointed."
