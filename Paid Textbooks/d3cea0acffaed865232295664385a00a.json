                "Text": "Finally, a book by someone who knows what he's talking about!  John S. Lewis has impressive credentials in the area of space resources, and he gives them to the reader in a concise, objective manner.  This book is a far cry from other space authors' uses of hyperbole, criticism, or wild assumptions.  The book also stays within the general realm of the believable, not straying too far from facts to speculate about \"what could be done with this.\"  While such asides are mildly entertaining, it is my belief both that the reader can imagine her own wild developments from space technology and resources; and that the real future will prove even today's best thought-out plans to be hokey and narrow-minded.  John S. Lewis shows a rare mix of expertise, prose, and restraint, and makes this a must-have for anyone interested in this area."

While the book is nearly a decade old, the primary message remains poignant and relevant even more so in the 21st Century. It is my hope that the author will do a second edition in the near future. With recent robotic missions to the Moon, Mars, asteroids and comets having taken place since the book was first published, I am certain that there is even much more to now be said about the economics of space-based mineral commerce."

I found some of the business ideas mildly uncomfortable, but the  science seems waterproof, and the author's enthusiasm and optimism shine  through the technical details.  Underlying the science and engineering and  business is an exhilirating breath of philosophy that borders on the  metaphysical.  Dr Lewis certainly provides plenty of objective  justification for his ideas, but between the lines you can capture the  heady euphoria of the early days of space exploration.  These passages  verge on the sublime.  EXCELLENT."

Lucid, engaging, with hardnosed facts and data generously spiced with imaginative vignettes of \"how it could be.\"  While we've missed the target of \"L5 by '95\" -- at least 1995, anyway -- this book prescribes a path that if followed with a modicum of enthusiasm, could result in hitting that target with ease by 2095...perhaps in another solar system entirely."
