                "Text": "This is one of the finest textbooks on applied mathematics.  It is appropriate for a wide range of levels and disciplines.  A moderately paced graduate class can finish most of the chapters in a full year.  The first two chapters cover material that is difficult to find elsewhere and nowhere is it better handled.  The real boon to this book is the constant integration of physical reasoning with solid mathematical theory.  To be sure, many of the more complicated ideas are only mentioned, but the later chapters pick these up and go much further.  It covers basic heat and wave applications, but also Brownian motion and gas dynamics.  A solid calculus background is needed, which includes vector calculus and convergence issues.  Eigenvalues and some functional analysis are needed.  Many books on elementary partial differential equations spend all their time on the big three: heat, wave and Laplace.  This is too low a level for any graduate class and doesn't create the excitement other applications provide.  On the other hand, this book is accessible to many people.  Often, graduate texts are thoroughly awash with Sobolev spaces and weak convergence and the physical problem, i.e., the actual model, is all but ignored.  This classic text is the bridge between elementary and advanced applied mathematics.  In some respects, it is self-contained.  Guenther and Lee have written an indispensable book."

The book has too many gaps as I see it has too many jumps when a physical  phenomena represented using mathematics. Physical concept was most of the  times not even mention, and I believe that the author should stick only  with mathematics since they try to explain physics they don't really  familiar with."
