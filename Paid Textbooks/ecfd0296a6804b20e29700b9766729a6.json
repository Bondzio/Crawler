                "Text": "When it comes to a Junior-Senior textbook on electromagnetism, electrical engineers and physicists will want a different approach. However, electronics engineering is close to physics and this book comes close to  pleasing both  groups.  Probably the best book on EM theory for electronics  engineers is \"Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics\" by  Ramo, Whinnery, and van Duzer.  Ramo is the R in the company called TRW.  Nonetheless, Shadowitz covers the basics of an EM text for electonics  engineers, for example, transmission lines, waveguides, and antenna  radiation.  Sprinkled throughout the text are interesting tidbits of  theoretical physics.  The book is in SI units, but  he adequately informs  the reader about esu and emu units, a discussion of which seems to have  become unfortunately banned at some American colleges."

As is the case in most all universities, even the largest, the physics department is usually like a family, very close and friendly and somewhat smaller than other departments, with fewer major students. We had one of the best physics curricula of any university!(Even European university representatives would visit us to see how we handled our curriculum.) Dr. Shadowitz tested out many if not most of the exercises in this book on us with good results. I learned a great deal from him, both in physics and in life. He loved teaching and explained the subject in the most revealing way possible. This book reflects his methods and love of the subject. I hear he is no longer with us. I will miss him."
