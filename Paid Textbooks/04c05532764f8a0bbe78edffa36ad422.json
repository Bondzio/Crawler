                "Text": "Quantum Field Theory by Itzykson and Zuber is truly a great text for this subject. The exposition is fairly good as well as a good number of examples without being just a problem book. There is something in it for everyone from experimental particle physicists to theorists. In this way it has a truly broad scope which makes it even more attractive given that you can normally find a copy for under $30. The book is not a great book for a first time exposure to the material, but I came to really appreciate this book when I took QFT using Peskin and Schroder and found that after I worked through most of semester with that text that Itzykson and Zuber became very accessible to me and handles certain topics a little better that P&S.; I gave it only 4/5 just for the text not being an real intro type text."
