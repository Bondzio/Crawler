                "Text": "Yes, finally, I get the hoopla with the fourth dimension. Rucker explains things with lots of classsical geometric illustrations. Not intending to scare you, I must warn you that he takes the reader all the way to a 5-dimensional world. Still, it is simple to explain, because he uses line-land (the 2-dimansional version of flatland) adds a dimension, then one more, and the result can be visualized in 3-D. I am just astounded that I could understand this without mind-crunching effort. It was not an easy read, but it was not very hard either. No derivatives, matrixes, integrals, or any of the other off-putting versions of mathematics. Just straight (actually fairly wrinkled) geometry."

                "Text": "This is the best introduction to non-Euclidean geometry and special relativity that I have ever encountered. The book is basic enough to be understandable (at least to a degree) by any intelligent (and determined)  adolescent, but deep enough for the physics or math undergraduate and  perhaps even graduate student to find continual interest in. Rucker has a  way of introducing complex ideas in a rather simple fashion so trhat one  doesn't often realise how deep the subject matter is at first. Unlike some  of his other books, however, considerable math background is required and a  substantial amount of effort and force of will on the part of the reader  will be necessary. All the same, the book is an intensely interesting foray  into the world of geometry and relativistic physics. His adaption af  Abbott's \"A.Square\" character to ealborated his ideas are  particularly amusing and helpful."
