Not only does he know the theory inside out, he has the ability to get accross the central points so it (almost) seems easy, in any case entertaining, using pictures (including cartoons), humor, and equations when they are needed. He further make clear the many fascinating links between chaos theory, algorithms, technology, and areas of pure math, such as number theory. Highly recommended!"

I find it specifically well suited for the the mathematically inclined layman and scientists outside mathematics who want to delve deeper into this subject. Note, however, that if you are a hard core mathematician (of the \"lemma - proof - corollary\" type), you might probably find this book too superficial and light for your taste, so this book is not for you. If you are an Earth, Life or medical scientist, or just a mathematically curious guy, you will find this book interesting and rewarding. I wholeheartedly recommend it."

First, while not serious enough by itself for me to deduct even one star, the title is misleading. The author intended to write a book about self-similarity. The topics of fractals, chaos, and power laws are byproducts of his focus on self-similarity. So the coverage of those topics is haphazard. I guess the publisher chose the title to pick up on current buzzwords. Second, even considering what the book is really intended to be about, the exposition is disjointed. Each chapter is a collection of a few loosely related examples. Third, while a popularization necessarily must be handwavy, many passages were the kind of over- and misstatements you see in newspaper writing. Also, he tends to insert equations in the text where a good turn of phrase would have been more effective."
