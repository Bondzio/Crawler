A new edition done with the aid of computers, color ink, and more contemporary exercises would go a long way towards clearer understanding."

                "Text": "Affectionately referred to as BMW (from the author names), this book was the required text for my intro spaceflight mechanics course in college. Not only did I do just about every problem in the book (which helped me blow away the final), but over the next 15 years I kept coming back to it for quick reference. Some of my commercial products contain simple Kepler solvers and orbit integrators that began life in BMW. Compared to other books in this field, it's a deceptively easy read. But I know of at least one rocket destroyed by engineers ignorant of the basics in sections 9.5 and 9.6. Sure, it leaves out chaos and I really wish it used SI rather than imperial units (actually, it favors canonical units, a useful and units-agnostic concept). But BMW is the simplest, most intuitive intro to astrodynamics I've ever seen."

For the beginners calculus, Algebra and some geometry knowledge are required  otherwise the other aspect are well explained. I like the examples with its  solution in this book, it force the reader to understand the principle  especially if the subject sometimes is out of our daily vision. I have no  problem following up this book, it simple and has all the principle and  scientific logic you need to understand the science of space dynamics. It's  a very good bargain with its price."

Its approach to the subject was very fundamental. The only problem I had going through this book was with the use of old units. I will therefore suggest that a revised edition based on Scientific Units (SI unit) be considered and I believe this would make this book become more universal. It is indeed a great book on this subject!"

I've learned to be particularly wary of books whose titles begin with \"Introduction to\" or \"Fundamentals of\" because they tend to start out with a few pages about the really simple fundamentals, then the rest of the book is completely abstruse.  This book is not like that.  The authors (Bate, Mueller and White) start from fundamentals and proceed slowly and steadily to build on them in a logical fashion. The book contains exercises that (wonder of wonders) actually added to my understanding of the material.  The authors clearly have experience teaching this subject and seemed to have an intuitive grasp of exactly where I would have trouble understanding, whereupon they would offer a little extra extra explanation or some coaching about the math or even (wow) a discussion about the physical implications of a mathematical equation they had derived.  This book is exactly what the title claims; \"Fundamentals of Astrodynamics.\" Note that you will need to know trigonometry and some vector math and linear algebra before reading this book."

It's somewhat entertaining seeing half of the formulas with sections drawn in by hand. They also go on a bit about the Soviets and the Red Chinese, which is always a treat. The units throughout the book are a random mix of nautical miles, kilometers, and canonical units. Overall the book does its job, but there are probably better orbital mechanics books out there."
