                "Text": "This is a fantastic book and I'm sorry it's hard to get now.  I found it  by accident in a used book store in Madison, WI, in 1995 and found I  learned a lot from it, even though by that time I had already taken  multiple classes in Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Statistics,  etc.  Dr. Morrison really sets out in lucid detail many of the important  developments in applied modeling theory--dynamical systems, stochastic  systems, the fudamentals that lie behind them--from a very useful  perspective, and one that is often missing from the orthodox academic  treatments.  What he chooses not to cover in detail he references  thoroughly.  I wish that I had had this book when I was learning many of  the topics.  Anyone who is seriously considering learning dynamic modeling  should read this book and I have little doubt that fairly experienced  modelers will find something between the covers."

This book can benefit both persons who are just beginning a study of dynamic modeling and I dare say things will be learned by even those that are researchers in the area.  Good work Foster Morrison whoever you are."

It asks you to casually re-examine the natural world and challenges you to come up with a way to view dynamic and interdependent systems mathematically. It explains the role of research and how to develop your own methods and approaches by keeping perspective with other disciplines. Truly a help in identifying relationships and attempting to express them mathematically."
