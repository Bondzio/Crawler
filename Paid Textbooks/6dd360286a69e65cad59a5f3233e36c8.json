I think it's all right for an author to engage in hand-waving arguments if this enhances physical intuition or even to make the occasional statements without proof if this allows more ground to be covered.  However, if a proof actually is presented, I expect this proof to be correct.  In this book, proofs are sometimes only for special cases of theorems stated more generally and often contain logical errors."
