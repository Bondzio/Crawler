Right and left brackets <> are shown as boxes in the main text(although they are correct in equations)  As the brackets are used for Dirac\u2019s notation throughout the text, this typo is more than just an minor annoyance. Dirac's bra and kett notation is a major part of quantum mechanics and having them printed incorrectly means confusion. I am surprised that this slipped past proof reading. This really is too bad, I really enjoyed Dr Susskind's 1st book and his videos so much and was looking forward to this new book. I'm sorry that this excellent content is ruined by this error. Again, buy the print copy."

                "Text": "Professor Susskind's lecture series on You Tube are very popular and he deserves our thanks for his efforts. It is also wonderful that there is an audience that wishes to learn these subjects. It is assumed that you know linear algebra and complex variables. If you have not had these subjects or need a refresher, you will have a better time with this book if you study or review these subjects. I would recommend the Cliff Quick Review of Linear Algebra by Leduc and Chapter 1 of Schaum's Complex Variables 2nd edition by Spiegel. They both have many worked out problems and the books are inexpensive.There are more expensive alternatives like Engineering Mathematics by Stroud or Shankar's Quantum Mechanics textbook which cover these areas.  Susskind makes heavy use of spin and the Pauli Matrices as a basic model for quantum mechanics. A similar approach was taken in Jordan's Quantum Mechanic in Simple Matrix Form published in the 1980s and available on Dover. Susskind is a good teacher and further simplifies the math, probabilities,  commutators, and operators to make the subject more easy to follow. The introductions to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger Equation, and Entaglement  are nicely done and are a good read. If you want to learn some concepts of basic Quantum Mechanics and are not adverse to the math described this book will fill that need. Learn or review the mentioned math first or you will be lost quickly. You need to know what a complex number is,why we need complex numbers, how to obtain a complex conjugate, and Euler's famous formula. Susskind covers this in three short pages which is unlikely to mean much to you if you do not remember or know the math.  It will also help to watch the lectures on You Tube.  The major flaw of the book is the excercises.  They range from easy to hard. The answers are not provided and the techniques for answering them should be fully worked out. This should have either been added as an appendix to the book or posted on the web. These excercises are meant to test and rewire your brain. They are important teaching tools but  most of us do not have teaching assistants to check our answers and help us when we are lost. What may be obvious to the teacher is frequently not obvious to the rest of us. I have taken off one star for not have a longer chapter on the math required. I have also taken off a star for the lack of answers (worked out would be even better) for the excercises."

The ideal reader should have some background in classical mechanics (particularly the Hamiltonian formulation), some background in linear algebra, and not faint when he or she hears \"Hilbert space.\" It would probably be a good companion text to a standard quantum mechanics text. There's definitely a niche for this book -- I don't know of any other book with this kind of careful yet verbose explanation. I particularly like the first example Susskind gives for the Schrodinger equation."

Once you get this, you should be able to go on to more advanced texts and not worry about the physical basics and mathematical flow that sometimes seem a little obscure without a minimum such as this. A Ph.D. in chemistry was my foundation for reading this and even having studied the basics of nuclear magnetic resonance, it was nice to go back and fill in some of the conceptual holes in my understanding. I would have been able to use it back at undergraduate level to provide a foundation for what I wanted to go on and do."

Yet the authors are just brilliant in introducing essential concepts such as vector space, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, operators, and non-commutators in a way that a layperson can understand. These concepts are used to describe in mathematical and logical terms what measurements and observations signify. Building on these, the authors then employ similar method to explain what entanglement and Uncertainty Principle mean. The emphasis is on the logical structure of quantum mechanics and not philosophical speculation (section 7.10 maybe one exception). Schr\u00f6dinger equation is also derived and explained. It should be noted that Volume 1 is presumed knowledge."

His pedagogical style of telling us what to expect, then telling us, then reiterate when necessary provides the clearest and easiest explanation yet of the fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics, especially of entanglement. His sprinkling of humorous remarks and obvious empathy with students makes this book a delight to read. After finishing this book I feel ready to tackle more complex applications and problem solving."
