I feel as if it's hard to read but maybe that's just the way it translated or maybe it just can't really be translated. I am a Math Geek and all I really do care about are the equations anyways."

I only read certain chapters of Archimedes (each chapter on a different topic essentially) and greatly enjoyed reading -how he thought -or, as Heath notes, what he actually put down.  Some things, as noted, later mathematicians tried to figure out just how Archimedes came to such knowledge - often with great success - sometimes not - a great book for thinking about mathematics."
