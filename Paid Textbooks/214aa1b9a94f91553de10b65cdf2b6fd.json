It contains all the information necessary to properly design a solar passive house.  The only negative is that it is 1979 Copyright, out of print, and may therefore be hard to acquire.  The best current book that we have is by Daniel D. Chiras, \"The Solar House\".  James Kachadorian's \"The Passive Solar House\" is also an excellent current book in terms of the excellent engineering information provided although some of the slab construction recommendations may be somewhat dated and not in line with current best practice.  The worst book we have encountered was Debra Coleman's \"Sun Inspired House\".  This book is merely an advertisement of the plans she sells and we would definitely advise applying due diligence if considering to do business with her.  For those interested in doing passive solar design, we added some calculators to our website that you can find by Googling Borst Engineering & Construction LLC."
