                "Text": "This book will be difficult for \"paper mathematicians\" because it describes concepts of orientations in multidimensional configuration space that requires visual / spatial ability. It does so with with a depth and granularity that can be appreciated by those who work with these \"tools\".  This small book is not a quick read, nor a general overview. It takes time to ruminate on these words to gain understanding of increasingly important behaviors in classical and quantum physics, as well as modeling the complexity in systems.  But, these rewards require an investment of time and thought."
