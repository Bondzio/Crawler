The book provides a great outline for the scientific concepts that were utilized in the movie Interstellar. The discussions on the anatomy of black holes, wormholes, the bulk, and the 5th dimension are all wonderful, concise, and very understandable. The book does not get into the math behind some of the concepts, though Professor Throne does tell where to find it if one is interested. The book is also illustrated very nicely. After reading this book I think it will make me appreciate seeing Interstellar again, once it comes out on blu-ray. Even if you didn't see the movie, I still think it is a very interesting read for those who love physics, like myself."

Though I teach this subject at the college level, I have learned a few new things, while getting a slightly different perspective on subjects such as black holes. If you have an interest in astronomy and have seen the movie, then this book will be of interest. It will take a bit of commitment, but the outcome is worthwhile. The language is quite accessible. The illustrations are first rate. The book is full color throughout and printed on heavy coated paper. This book is a very nice addition to my library. If you want to learn some science that happens to be tied to an entertainment (the movie Interstellar), then I recommend this book highly."

This book answered a lot of questions I had about what actually happened in Interstellar (according to Thorne's interpretation) and whether it fit in with what I understand about physics (I'm a physics major). His style strikes me as a little too much like an educational video when he asks questions like, \"What do you think?\" Instead of just explaining what he means right away. Also, many of the illustrations he uses seem weirdly cheap for a book that goes along with a movie with such amazing visual effects. Overall though I found his style to be charming and engaging."

                "Text": "Although I haven't seen the movie yet, I bought everything about it in book form.  I'm obviously a sci-fi nut.  My own difference from the intended Hollywood-defined Mass Audience (Slam!) is that I have been studying gravitation theory, high-energy particle physics (Wheeler), and advanced math since the 1960s, worked at UCSD in high-energy physics, and gee whiz, got lectured by people at Cal Tech like Feynman.  There, take that--I can drop names too, which this book does a helluva lot.  I'm delighted to read about the people who make movies.  Watching an Extra on the BLADE RUNNER Blu-ray disc yesterday reinforced what Kip Thorne says about Directors:  they are gods.  The Director goes with Mass Audience appeal over Truth,  beauty over Truth, which is how to make money and get an Oscar for Special Effects.  Nothing wrong with that.  Unusual to read that Truth in a science book, however.  I appreciate the updates in cosmology theory, even when they have to be labeled truth, educated guess, or speculation.  There should have been a fourth circled symbol OG for when explanations were meant for Old Geezers like me.  All the emphasis on colorful black boards full of symbols takes me back to the obviously-Einstein character in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, although his blackboard was just plain chalk on slate probably.  In both movies, that DAY ESS and INTERSTELLAR, a blackboard full of incomprehensible (to The Mass Audience) are as much Eye Candy as the actresses.  One of my Professors wrote equations with his right hand and simultaneously erased them with his left hand.  Thanks to this book and its internet links, at least we can study the equations longer, until our brains float thru the branes.  Funny how INTERSTELLAR has a religious or occult theme, like CONTACT bringing Arroway to her dead father, and GRAVITY bringing its heroine to prayer and thanksgiving at the end.  Is it fair to ask if that trope should be labeled S?  Mass Audience again will answer."

                "Text": "Great book explaining all the science behind the movie. However in the book there are some conflicting claims about the properties of black holes that should be cleared up. In Chapter 5 on Black Holes on page 45, Dr. Thorne writes \"First, a weird claim: Black holes are made from warped space and warped time. Nothing else - no matter whatsoever.\" Then in Chapter 6 on Gargantuan's Anatomy on page 57, Dr. Thorne writes \"If we know the mass of a black hole and how fast it spins, then from Einstein's relativistic laws we can deduce all the hole's other properties:\". If there is no matter whatsoever in a black hole, how can we calculate the mass? The equation w (weight, matter) = m (mass) x g (gravity) doesn't hold since Einstein's relativistic laws are used to calculate the mass where m (mass) = c2 (speed of light squared) / E (energy). I think this should have been made clearer with some simple examples and calculations to reduce confusion for the average person between mass and matter and where and how the Energy is measured for a black hole. I do like the quote about black holes to indicate that there are no extra, independent properties beyond its mass and spin on page 57: \"A black hole has only two hairs, from which you can deduce everything else about it.\" One question though, what about non-spinning black holes, are these just \"single hair\" black holes? I also really like Dr. Thorne's labeling of the status of the science for Interstellar on page 33 where \"T\" stands for Truth (green), \"EG\" stands for Educated Guess (purple), and \"S\" stands for Speculation (red) and this is labeled in color at the beginning of a chapter or section so the reader is aware of where science stands today on the particular subject in the movie. Overall a great book on black holes and explaining all the science behind the movie which couldn't be explained well in the movie's limited time. Well worth the read and furthering of science education."

Apart from the occasional gratuitous diagram or photograph, there is little to complain about. Touted as having a great degree of scientific accuracy, Kip actually points out that the depiction of many events were actually dumbed down by Chris Nolan who thought that his audience would be too stupid to make sense of them. I'm thinking, \"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!  Most of the stuff accurately depicted is above the heads of the average scientist. Why dumb down _any_ of it?\"  Perhaps Chris Nolan is just a typical Hollywood primadonna who abandons consistency when producing a film. I think they call that \"artistic license.\"  Ask me what I call it. I do give Kip and the graphics team for genuine physics breakthroughs in modeling visualizations of black holes.  The book is instructive and the average reader will struggle with some of the material, but where I come from, we call that learning."

                "Text": "In Amanda Gefter's book \"Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn\", she wrote how Kip Thorne wasn't into research as much any more because he's \"bored\".  He is more into working on two Hollywood science fiction movies and writing for Playboy.  That's one of the privileges of tenure, how much fun it is to tell the world to get off.  I admire how even then, he's still got young bright Caltech graduate students writing great code for simulating accretion disks around black holes.  Well, true to form, Thorne came out with this book on one of those movies, \"Interstellar\", in a few months.  So many authors have written on this topic now they almost form a tribe that talk to each other across Kindle.  So that sour grape remark aside aside, let me get down to the movie, then this review.  The movie I thought was the worst mishmash of nonsense from the narrative point of view.  No part of the story is believable and there's no character worth any empathy with.  The lead actor is a corn farmer who's supposed to be an alienated or semi-retired rocket scientist who can spout general relativity with aplomb but does it in such a slur I couldn't make out half the words in the theater.  Maybe watching it on IMAX might have helped but I have my doubts.  When he tunnels through the wormhole and can still watch the latest news of his daughter on TV, I can no longer suppress my annoyance and have a hard time letting go and following the thread.  Well, that's where this book comes in: to explain what I missed.  First Gargantuan, and all the latest hype about the software written just for the movie (that's being published in a scientific journal for GR simulations).  Well and good, except the picture that's generated by all that software is no better than the picture of just such a thing as I can find in a textbook by one of Thorne's peers: Edwin Taylor and GR's main maven, the late great John Wheeler.  That great book is \"Exploring Black Holes, Introduction to General Relavitivy\" which you can find on Amazon.  The story of the movie gets worse towards the end, when attempts are made to create closure on past-future communications, before the canned final Hollywood ending with the lead jetting off to join his pseudo-romantic interest and colonizer near Saturn.  Like the Time Machine man going back in time to rescue the girl from the Morlocks.  Yes, \"Interstellar\" the movie is a true non-dazzling mess, but perversely I look forward to more from Professor Thorne in the future, because he's always right out there."

This book also has the potential to inspire young readers to go into theoretical physics. I gave a copy to all young men and women I know (14 years old and up) hoping to get us at least one new bright mind working in this field; there is so much we still don't know. And if you feel so inclined there are also some equations in the back of the book (in technical notes), with questions that make you go back and think to see if you really understand things.  Fabulous book. Great job Dr. Thorne!"

Very informative, but the last part of the book is excessively opaque (I have a background in physics and have read some of the references Kip Thorne cites), and some of the physics assumptions seem pretty preposterous on the face it (though admittedly, he did have to accommodate the needs of the filmmakers). By comparison, I thought Lisa Randall's book \"Warped Passages..\" cited by Thorne is far more lucid when the ideas get really dense. Nevertheless, Thorne did a service to popularizing science by lending his skills to the making of this movie and then expending the effort to write this book."

The renderings of Gargantua are the first accurate view of a black hole would actually look like, using the equations that Thorne created. After reading the book I want to see the movie again!"

Some parts get very detailed but as he says, you can skip some if you want and still enjoy it. I'm glad the producers, director, and rest of the crew stuck with science reality and educated guesses in this film. It truly shows science is beautiful and amazing."

Celebrity and renowned physicist Kip has laid down the book into different categories based on truth, educated guess and speculation. This makes it easier to understand and appreciate the movie all the more. There are plentiful Images in the book which add a TON of value in making one understand the concepts. For e.g. the image where an ant is walking on the trampoline to explain the concept of bulk. I definitely recommend this book to anyone including a layman like me who doesn't understand a lot about physics. After reading this book, I've become a big fan of Kip Thorne and I wish that lot of youngsters reading this book gravitate towards astro physics."

Kip does an excellent job of taking very math-heavy concepts and presenting them in a way that make natural sense to the reader. In this way, he truly knows his audience. As a big fan of the film, I loved how Kip shared how the movie came about and how he worked with Christopher Nolan and the visual effects team to make everything as scientifically accurate as possible."

Thorne's explanations of some really high-end theoretical concepts of relativity and space time were fascinating.  However, his incessant fawning over the Nolan brothers, the constant name-dropping, and his subtle but frequent reminders to the reader how important and intelligent he thinks he is really dragged the book down quite a bit, in my opinion - hence the three stars."

I put it down after a few chapters, and I was really excited to read this after seeing (and loving) Interstellar. I do not like when scientists or other experts try to explain complex terms to their readers with cliched, dumbed-down writing."

Second chapter starts with calling the Big Bang a \"gigantic explosion.\" I'll amend my review if I continue onward, although I'm not pleased with this book so far. I'm generally a huge fan of Kip Thorne's popular works, hence the purchase of this book."

I am grateful that I never took a class from him, for he couldn't explain why it gets dark in a paper bag, much less how a space traveler can drop into the gravitational pull of a dying star and end up behind a book shelf in a rural American farmhouse decades before he took off and then telepathically program a watch on the front side of the bookcase to convey the secret of escaping the Earth's gravity."
