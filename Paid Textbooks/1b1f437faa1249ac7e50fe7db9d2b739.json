If you can learn applied math straight out of this textbook, then you are smarter than I am.  For me, I had to find a bunch of other resources to help me learn the material... a compilation of other less-terrible textbooks checked out from the library plus a bunch of internet resources."

                "Text": "The book uses most of chapter 1 to explain techniques and concepts from Linear Algebra. Toward the end he makes the connection between vector space and functional space and has a common language developed. The Linear Algebra is not of a very high level and should have been covered in a good undergraduate course. The Function Space concepts should be familiar to anyone having taking ODE using Fourier Transforms. I am know working in Chapter 2 and the concise way he writes leaves out steps or doesn't make explicit connections and so I find myself re-reading and looking for other resources. I have not tried the exercises but they look to run from straight forward to ridiculous, which is probably what a graduate text should do. So if he had used a few more words and steps I would give 5 stars but alas, I cannot."
