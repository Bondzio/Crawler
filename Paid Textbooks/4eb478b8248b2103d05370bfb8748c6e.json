                "Text": "This book is geared to the general reader who has a cursory knowledge of mathematics.  The chapters are organized around physical phenomena and the math behind their explanation.  The result is a charming and VERY useful book.  I have the 1970 edition which is quite worn from frequent use.  The chapter titled, Differential Equations - The Heart Of Analysis, is exceptionally beautiful and pertinent.  Reading this book is akin to a treasure hunt.  There is page after page of mathematical discovery.  Reading the chapter on  Motion Of Projectiles  made me terribly angry at the banal way in which this topic is handled in high school texts.  Things such as quadratic equations and the law of gravitation are explained very well.  I sincerely believe that this book should be a required text for High School math students.  Highly recommended.  The Dover edition is very affordable so even if it means foregoing a meal, do it.  Buy this book!  Well worth your time."

                "Text": "I agree with the above review and would simply like to add my own thoughts.  The book illustrates the fascinating way in which mathematics, society, religion, politics and of course physics have affected each other  (it goes both ways!) through out the ages.  Furthermore, the author nicely  illustrates the processes by which people think and how those processes  have also changed through the ages (i.e., The Age of Reason versus The  Renisance).  This book left me with real insights as to the nature and  limitations of the current state of mathematics and physics.  Things are  not as they seem, my friend!  Lastly, the author displays an appreciation  for the humor and irony of the history which makes this book hard to put  down at times.  I never thought a math/history book could be a \"page  turner\"... Read it."

I also have bought Morris Kline's Mathematics for the Non-mathematician, and a lot of the material mentioned in that book is repeated here, which made reading this particular book a rather dull experience.  This book is only useful for the lessons in the history of mathematics it provides.  If you seek mathematical uplift and you have considerable math experience, I would suggest you buy Kline's calculus book instead, which also goes through basic physics very well."

                "Text": "I studied Chemical Engineering as an undergraduate and got to see more than my fair share of mathematics during that time. I got through the program, but there were a lot of fragmented mathematical concepts in my mind. Ten years after graduation I'm finding an interest in revisiting old math textbooks and this book has been a godsend. For me, it shows how the various fields of math fit together. There are just enough anecdotes to make the overall concepts memorable. Morris is a great writer and it feels like he is on your team as he explains the concepts. I started tutoring my 10 year old nephew and I'm taking lessons from this book to make sure he has a sound foundation for more advanced concepts later on. I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it highly."

If you are looking for a refresher or an aid for a current class, Kline's books will prove highly valuable.  The only way I was able to read both of these books is through the efforts of Dover, who has been reissuing out of print science and math books for many years.  I was very happy to see that Dover is making at least some of these available in Kindle format."

Poor execution of port from print to digital: frequent errors that appear to be generated by an OCR scan that wasn't thoroughly proofed, which probably won't trip up math veterans. I'm about 30% through with it and will update this review if warranted."
