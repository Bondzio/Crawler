                "Text": "Although much of the Mathematics (especially in the endnotes) is beyond my capability (even though I have a graduate degree in Math) the story of how this man fell in love with Math, overcame the anti-semitism in the Soviet educational system to become a Mathematician, and sought connections both within Mathematics and between Mathematics and Physics is fascinating and vividly told.  My advice to the reader-- just skip what you don't understand.  There is enough here without that to make for interesting reading."

                "Text": "A boy who grew up in a town closer to Moscow became interested in quantum physics. Plenty of popular science books were easy for him to find to read. His parents were engineers and were quick to recognize boy's talents. A mathematics professor of the only college in the town who is also a friend of the family took the boy under his wings. The professor asked him if he knew about the group SU(3). This conversation made the boy realize that he had to learn math to answer many questions he had by reading popular science books. Thus began the journey of this boy becoming one of the premier mathematicians of today. He was introduced to great mathemati- cians from the beginning. Mathematicians gave him problems to solve. He solved his first problem on Braid groups as a freshman. He attended Israel Gelfand\u2019s legendary seminars at Moscow State University. He was offered a visiting professorship at Harvard even before he received his bachelor\u2019s degree. To get a permanent job he needed a degree. He enrolled in the Harvard PhD program and received his PhD in one year. He first heard about the Langlands Program at Harvard. Since then until today he has been working on the Lang- lands Program. Langlands program is like a Rosetta stone revealing similarities in three apparently unrelated fields; namely, Number the- ory & curves/finite fields, Riemann surfaces and Quantum Physics. The book \"Love and Math\" is Edward Frenkel\u2019s autobiography. He has done a masterful job of trying to bring hard mathematics that he has been working on to a level of an average reader by inter-vowing it with his fascinating life experiences. It is hard not to get excited about the math that you know practically nothing about. \"Love and Math\" makes you wanting to read more and get to know more about this fascinating mathematics. Frenkel has included many references for an interested reader to follow through as notes at the end of the book. \"Love and Math\" is a must read for young and old alike."

                "Text": "I expected this book to be yet another popular mathematics book explaining some fascinating mathematical subject at a level that most readers can partially understand. But this book is different. It does try to communicate the ideas in the Langlands Program, but for most readers, including me (a mathematically trained computer scientist), that material remains inaccessible. That is OK. The real subject of this book is the love and passion of mathematicians and the wonder of the profound connection between mathematics and the natural world.  I appreciate the fact that the author does not strain to simplify the deepest material down to my level.  I get great pleasure out of getting the flavor of material that is over my head, and understanding in that indirect way how vastly more mathematics is known to the specialists than I will ever know, and yet how much more there is that none of them even knows."

                "Text": "My wife bought this book for me, and handed it to me with some apprehension, because I am a serious scientist with a very strong background in mathematics, physics and computing, now a retired professor of biomedical informatics.  She knows I have little patience for popularizations of math, physics and computing.  This book is very different.  It has something for everyone.  If you have no math background, you won't get everything, but so what?  If you go to an ice hockey game and have never played you will not see or appreciate everything that is happening.  Still, you can appreciate the flow, the beauty, the greatness of the game.  We don't get to watch mathematicians at work like watching ice hockey, but Frenkel's book gives you a view.  The personal stories, like the interviews of ice hockey players, help give a personal perspective to what it is to be a mathematician.  This book will help you appreciate the beauty and greatness of mathematics.  It is an honest exposition.  The explanations are the real thing, not silly metaphors that don't really convey the truth.  I learned real math (theory of groups, topology, symmetry, transfinite numbers, etc.) from books like Courant and Robbins's classic, \"What is Mathematics\", and yes, in school I also had to learn arithmetic, algebra, calculus, etc., but the fun stuff is not much taught in schools.  It should be.  I hope this book will stir people to make some changes in the way math is taught.  Math is for everyone, not so they can become professionals, but so that they can enjoy it, and feel more comfortable in a world that is and always has been mathematical to the core, now more than ever.  Frenkel's book belongs with Courant and Robbins and likely also will become a classic.  Mathematics is a mind boggling adventure, as exciting and spectacular as mountain climbing, but a lot safer.  So play safe, take the advice of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, study mathematics and enjoy the trip of a lifetime."

I DID!!!! Right at the start he said 'what if your introduction to art was just having to draw a garage.\" We connected immediately. That's exactly what my introduction to art was: we had to walk through the field behind the school, sit down, and draw the garage on the other side of the fence. AWFUL!  As I read through (this was a while ago), he began to explain a point using a round table. I thought, Phooey! this is the kind of stupid stuff I always got in geometry. But I found myself thinking about what Frankel said over the next few days, went back and reread the section, and I got it! Fantastic. Then I remembered my CalcII prof, a strange yet fascinating guy. One day he walked into class, drew a backward L on the board and marked point A on the horizontal line and B on the vertical. His question: what was the shortest distance between the two points. The class groaned & tuned out. Two of us listened fascinated while he 'proved' it was a line composed of tiny incremental steps. A great lesson in thinking. Wish I could have had him for more classes. Thank you Edward Frankel for getting me thinking again."

                "Text": "Renowned mathematician, Berkeley math professor and Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Edward Frenkel has written a book about his passion for math that has driven into the heart of some of our current deepest math problems. He weaves his own life through his voyage of discovery of mathematical reality. He starts with his early life and describes how an early family friend hooked him on math and then his struggles with anti-Semitism and Soviet era bureaucracy with a riveting story how Frenkel, his friends, colleagues and mentors were able to thwart the Soviet Bureaucracy in their pursuit of math.  Throughout he attempts to clearly explain the math issues that drove him and his cohorts. Not having had a math class since the 9th grade, I can\u2019t say I understood everything he explains but he is clear enough to allow the lay reader to follow the general outlines. This excellent book opens the door on how mathematicians and scientists work together at very high levels and helps the lay reader understand the passions that keep them going. Their passion, tenacity, and creativity are inspiring. The book also emphasizes the utter stupidity of anti-Semitism and other forms of prejudice. An important part of Frenkel\u2019s story describes how the anti-Semitism of the Soviet and Russian system drove some of the most brilliant mathematical minds of our times from Russia to the universities of the west. The professional mathematician may dismiss this book as Frenkel\u2019s personal story while the lay reader may find the math off-putting. To let the math get in the way, in some sense, misses the whole point of the book."

The math in here can be a little difficult, but even if you don't fully understand what Frenkel is talking about, he explains it in such a way that you can grasp it a little bit. Being able to fully understand the things he is explaining in the book will require you to study group theory and riemannian geometry, which is pretty high level math; still this book is the most accessible book I have seen to the lay person trying to describe these concepts. This book has something for everyone though, its not just a math book, it is a a memoir as well and it reads like an adventure book. If the math confuses you, the story will captivate you. The characters that appear in the book are interesting and lively; many of them break the stereotype that mathematicians are anti-social nerds. The book math to places that you thought it wouldn't pop up. A memorable scene in the book is when Frenkel is working with a physician and using math to try and develop a method for diagnosing people of certain illnesses and when they should operate and when they should not."

Personally, I enjoyed getting some limited understanding of some topics I have heard about but never studied. After about half way through, 90% of readers, even those with some mathematical background, will mostly just get the flavor rather than any real understanding. At this point, I began skimming the mathematical sections of the text. Unfortunately it is also around this point that Frenkel gets pretty sketchy about relating much of his personal life as well."

Although there are a few technical sections, there is something inspiring here for everyone.  A central theme is a variation of the Cinderella story.  Here we have a true story of a bright young man, born with profound abilities to understand and influence mathematics, who was purposely isolated physically and socially by the Communist regime in Russia.  Nevertheless, focused hard work and dedication resulted in an invitation by Harvard University to visit, study, and teach. Young Frenkel was just approaching age 21, and a Ph.D. degree in Mathematics quickly followed his visit. He is currently a Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, in Berkeley. You may look in on him at his website, [...] to watch him teach or see the impressive list of contributions he has published. All of my grandchildren have heard this message, and they are getting copies of Frenkel's book for Christmas. Inspiration can be contageous.  Edward P. Parris"

                "Text": "This book is interesting on several levels. First, it is an account by a world's leading mathematician of exciting recent developments in mathematics and quantum physics, presented so that they can be understood even by people far away from math. Second, it is a compelling personal story of overcoming adversity and fulfilling one's dream that many can relate to. And third, it is powerful narrative on what it takes to make a breakthrough or achieve something of great importance. It turns out that genius needs teachers and mentors just like everyone else; it really \"takes a village\". The book's success is not only in giving the reader a good sense of what modern mathematics is about, but in making it human."

I understood nothing of the math that was discussed and I continually experienced that familiar bewilderment, frustration, and shut down that the author promised to replace with inspiration and excitement.

I was fascinated by his life story and how his searching for mathematical knowledge drew him to mentors who encouraged him on his journey of discovery. He was able to convey his story with a sense of warmth and enthusiasm which enabled me to view mathematics in a new light. I did not fully understand much of the formulae but as I persisted I was rewarded with an overall understanding. I found the combining of writing, the arts and mathematics another means of Edward Frenkels enthusiasm."

Fascinating! Almost as good are the parts where he talks about the math, where he does a great job of making some fairly complicated ideas understandable. I can't say that I cared for his musing on math and art, however.  But his love for math shines through and makes the book. (I'm not a mathematician, but I am a scientist and have a decent math background. It's not clear to me how much someone with little or no math background would get from it."

                "Text": "This book. It is incredible. Full of passion and wit, Frenkel clearly has great talent with the written word and an equally brilliant aptitude for pure mathematics. He draws together a broad narrative and weaves it together very well, showing the links between pure and applied mathematics, and the link with theoretical physics, especially in regard to quantum field theories and string theory, The Langlands Program, as far as I am concerned, is the real future of pure mathematics. I can see great application to theoretical computer science, in particular to quantum computing. This is highlighted by his introduction to category theory, much like set theory but rather than working with numerical outputs of functions, we deal instead with vector space outputs. A fascinating read - highly recommended."

The author is on a mission to open up the hidden universe of mathematics to everyone. He presents fascinating ideas, such as the Langlands Program, in an accessible and entertaining way, using analogies we can all relate to. Math comes alive as humanity's infinite quest for truth and beauty. Author's passion for mathematics is palpable, and this is what makes this book such an enjoyable read. His personal story is gripping and moving. He says in the Preface that after reading this book, \"mathematics will get under your skin and your worldview will never be the same\". In my opinion, he delivers on this promise."

The math is challenging, and there is a lot of it. And Frenkel fails to explain why the reader should care or struggle through it (I did). The connection between math and the erotic movie escapes me."

                "Text": "Recently, books have been appearing in which an applied mathematician will mix stories about his own research with an introduction to some field such as applications of nonlinear dynamics.  This book is a departure from this format.  First, there is an absorbing embedded story of how the author, growing up in the USSR, managed to surmount the obstacles placed before Jewish mathematicians in attaining a top position in the system.  When he relocated to the USA, his life changed and his mathematical creativity was recognized in a new field of pure mathematics, which takes me to the second element of the book: an introduction to the excitement of doing pure mathematics.  I'm trained in mathematics, although not with a Ph.d., and I immersed myself in his presentation of his field, finding it very interesting indeed -- although it can be tough reading even with some advanced math background.  I enjoyed this book very much and, by the way, I agree with the author's critical review of a book by Max Tegmark that concludes that the universe is made of purely mathematical objects.  This absurd idea shows that it's possible to have mastered theoretical physics and cosmology and still not grasp elementary metaphysics.  Frenkel avoids that trap because he seems to have a good understanding of the philosophical interpretation of natural science as well as a powerful command of the difficult terrain of the frontiers of pure mathematical research today.  I very much recommend this book for those who love mathematics as such even if its motivation in internal to math and not (initially) linked to a scientific problem."

For the great mathematicians \"passion\" not only reflects their love of mathematics but the way they live.  Dr. Frenkel lives this passion and the story behind \"Love & Math\" provides a glimpse into how this passion developed during those challenging early years when he was a young man in Russia.  Passion overcomes any obstacle including the apparently insurmountable barriers of State sanctioned discrimination.  It's impossible to finish this book without feeling a compelling drive to learn more mathematics.  I have taught college mathematics for a number of years and I have always found inspiration in the driving energy and expansive imaginations of the great mathematicians.  Dr. Frenkel carries on this tradition beautifully, for in the end it's beauty that defines great mathematics.  Thank you Dr. Frenkel."

In the second half he concentrates on math, which is really the main focus of the book. It might be a little heavy for some, but I loved it. You just have to learn to skim (or skip) over material that is too technical for your taste (or experience) and not feel guilty about it. That ability is necessary for reading many other good books (and papers)."
