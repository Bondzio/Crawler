I was in high school and Prof. Gamow  introduced me to the wonders of science - everything from Fermat's last theorem to the theory of relativity to the stars and galaxies and atoms and electrons. This book influenced my career choices; it taught me to look up and wonder, to sit down and think, and to appreciate the wonders of science and the greatness of the minds of the scientists who explored and invented and dreamed up science and math. I read the book from cover to cover again recently, and I still loved it! Thank you Prof. Gamow."

Not only does Gamow explain the mysteries of the universe in a way that is easy to understand, but his book covers more ground that even he realized when he wrote it.  Much of the book, (the sections on extremely large numbers, the drunkard's walk, the law of entropy, etc) is now being studied from a computer science point of view.  I studied much of this material in my computer science classes, only not in an atomic point of view, like Gamow, but in a binary point of view.  The theories and proofs are the same, just the application is slightly different.  I cannot recomend this book highly enough.  It is extremely readable and you don't need a doctorate in physics or math to understand what is being taught."

Much of it can be understood by a child, and other parts might require a little concentration. All of it is great fun. The author Gamow started in nuclear physics, during the Golden Age of Physics, worked with Niels Bohr, then later in the US, on the Manhattan Project during WWII, and after the war, he was professor in Boulder Colorado. The books he wrote are pearls, and they have been equally popular with my parent's generation as with mine. Luckely some have been reprinted! Other Gamow titles: Biography of Physics, Atomic Energy [dedicated to the hope of lasting peace], Physics of the Strapless Evning Gown,...We are lucky that Dover has reprinted some of them. Do more Dover!"

It clearly explains a  lot of concepts clearly, but its not a baby book either. The book is fun to  read, never boring and wide-ranging. Gamow has written other good books  eplaining elementary relativity and quantum mechanics to the mostly layman,  such as his 'Mr. Thompkins' series, which I loved. I hope that other athors  can try to explain concepts so clearly and lucidly, in a friendly manner  without sounding overbearing."

The book was written in a simple language and in so interesting manner that I just kept on reading and reading this book. This was the first book when I read about \"time\" as the fourth dimension and how it is similar to the rest of the three space dimensions. I also liked the idea of visualzing universe as a definite but endless entity (something like a mobius bottle or mobius surface). This book in all is a wonderful book to explain science from the 20th Century."

It opened my eyes to worlds suspected but not yet discovered; it became a guide for me.  Of course I went into the sciences (physics and engineering), and while that would probably have happened anyway, I must at least partly credit this book.  Years later I had the great pleasure of hearing Dr. Gamow (GAM-off) speak at UC Santa Barbara.  He was old (at least to me) and his accent was heavy, but that lecture sparkled and effervesced as his books.  As others noted, when Dr. Gamow led his explorations into the wonders of physics, he did not hesitate to develop the elegant mathematical concepts along the way, clearly and understandably.  He assumed his audience was intelligent enough to apprehend the concepts.  There may be more modern writings, more up-to-date coverage of physics for initiates; but I know of none that alternately glows and scintillates as this one does. This book is a jewel, a gift."

I remember in high school never understanding the reason for them and I even asked my teacher what they were for.  As I recall my math teacher couldn't explain anything beyond allowing us the ability to take the square root of negative numbers.  It was very satisfying to finally have a complete answer!

Despite being forced to read this book by my parents I found the book interesting and enticing. It had me hooked on page one.  George Gamow has crafted a masterpiece of complex principles made of simplified literature of things meant for college students, high school students, and teachers and adults and has changed it so that even an elementary school student can understand and enjoy. I could read this book over and over and still be fascinated.  I read this book cover to cover and found every sentence just as interesting as the last.  It can keep you interested for hours on an otherwise boring subject.  I would much rather read this book than have to take a course o  the same subject.  Instead of being bored five days a week by pointless lectures and tests and quizzes I could read this exciting book at my own pace and speed yet learning the exact same things. It doesn't bore you with pages upon pages of boring, emotionless writing, but instead adds visual depictions and a bit of emotions that makes it much more interesting than your typical textbook or any other educationally directed piece of literature. This book takes complex principles and changes them for the \"average\" person to read comprehend.  If you are a kid and your parents want you to read this take my word for it. It is much more interesting than it seems."

He's got some good chapters on math and probability and biology and chemistry - subjects that were well in hand by the late 60's.  But, when it comes to cosmology, astronomy and astrophysics, you may as well throw the book away.  This book is so dated that Gamow doesn't (couldn't) know that we actually launched a rocket into space.  His timeline for the universe is off by about 5 billion years.  He couldn't have known about observations of supernovaes in the late 1990's that proved the accelerated expansion of space.  And his theories on nucleosynthesis in the the Big Bang as well as nuclear fusion in the Sun are WAY off.  WAY off!"

So too, with some of the text.  HOWEVER, Gamov has picture data in the text that cannot be \"magnified\".  For example, I deciphered a fraction, 1/3, say, which is actually picture data on a text line, but I could not \"magnify\" the picture data so that I could read it.  There were other things like fractions and math details that I  couldn't decipher and couldn't \"magnify\".  This problem takes away some of the enjoyment of the book and a lot of the information.  In parts, the book reads like, \"... consider the mathematical formula ??????? which you can see is equal to ?????\".  I put in the ???? in the quote to represent the undecipherable content.  Needless to say, I returned the book.  I wish Kindle could and would fix this problem.  --LJM"
