There was a lot of repetition because in the way the author chose to report about test sites, rather than chronological.  All in all, I learned quite a bit about an exciting project, our mission to land a man on the moon and return him safely.  My interest in the Apollo space program is still high after all of the years since the first landing occurred on my 20th birthday.  I'm always looking for another book to read about the program."

This is the engine that took men to the moon, how sad it would be if we lost its history."

Lots of info on construction etc.  Only wish photos were larger & in color, tho they may not have been in color.  So just the size of the photos was slightly disappointing, but it doesn't make the book a disappointment.  Plus this would have added to the cost of the book as it'd have to be made larger.  Read this book & watch the test firings from the Saturn V DVD- a real complement (not included w/ book).  Highly recommend."
