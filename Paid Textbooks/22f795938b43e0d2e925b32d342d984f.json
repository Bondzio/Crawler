                "Text": "I do not know how I can adequately review this.  That this is indispensible to any theoretical physicist is pretty much the extent of what I am about to say.  I mean, here you have the greatest scientific giants of all time grappling with some of the deepest, most complicated issues of 20th century physics: you not only get the opportunity of finding out what they really thought about relativity, with all mathematical and philosophical details, but you also are able to see how truly great minds go about solving difficult problems (which, I feel, should be an inspiration for modern theoreticians as to how to solve the problems associated with quantum gravity, string theory, etc.).  Just the section of Einstein's paper The Foundations of a General Relativity Theory on the deep, philosophical reasons why a theory of nature should be generaly relativistic are well worth getting this book; I personally think that this one paper is the greatest scientific publication of all time (Principia is certainly bolder, more revolutionary, but Einstein's deepest ruminations, I feel, are almost religious).  To be sure, one needs certain mathematical training to get the full benefit of this book, but this could be said of relativity in general; I personally do not think that one can fully comprehend relativity theory, in all its beautiful glory, without this training.  Despite this, I still think it is possible, even without sufficient mathematical training, to get a real feel of how these titans thought and felt, even if just by osmosis (you know that profound thoughts are being expressed when you can almost grasp them without really understanding them).  In short, it is the duty of every physicist, maybe even every scientist, not just to read, but to EXPERIENCE this book (that is the only way I can adequately describe this; it is an experience)."

                "Text": "I really do not know how to rate this book. I hope that rating it with  three stars could be a neutral point between the opinions of laypeople and  the physics' community. This book is a collection of the most important  lectures given by Einstein, Lorentz, Minkowski and Weyl that led to the  formulation of the theory of relativity in its two parts. The first part is  the special theory, which studies the inertial and moving reference frames  without considering the effects of gravity. The second part, the general  theory, explains the nature of gravity as a consequence of the curvature of  Minkowski's four-dimensional space-time. The expositions featured in the  book are, of course, the written version of the lectures given decades ago  by its authors. Because of this, they are plenty of strange-looking and  complex equations to the laypeople but, for any physicist, is a beautiful  mathematical symphony that explains with accuracy the principle of  relativity. You have to be a physicist to fully understand this book,  namely, if you are not a physicist, or, if you are not formally studying  physics, please avoid this book!. I am almost sure that you will get tired  of reading it after the first lecture if you do not have solid knowledge of  physics and mathematics. Try to look somewhere else for less complicated  explanations of the relativity. Maybe the book: \"Relativity: The Special  and the General Theory\" could be useful for you, the laypeople.  Nevertheless, in the other hand, if you are a physicists or something like  that, this book must be in your shelf as one of the richest treasures in  all-time physics."

The names are well known to science specalists (and beyond). Nowadays it is common to derive Relativity Theory from Maxwell's Equations (although Maxwell thought they were in error!).  Apparently that was not Einstein's starting point. In any case, Planck championed Einstein and that settled it for History.
