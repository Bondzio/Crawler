                "Text": "This book is  a good way to refresh your memory of concepts from the first year of college physics. Shankar is well known to many quantum mechanics students book from his  textbook. He is a highly respected teacher with an online series on basic physics. I particularly enjoyed Chapter 16 on mathematical methods which is a quick summary of Taylor Series and complex variables. If you are familiar with this material, it is a nice relaxing read of old mathematical friends. The derivations for  the series for e, sin, and cos are straightforward if you remember beginning calculus. Shankar quickly mentions Leonard Euler. If you do not know who Leonard Euler is or the significance of the formula attributed him please read Maor's e:the Story of the Number and then Nahin's An Imaginary Tale. The chapters in this book are approximately 20 pages long and usually can be read with about an hour of time. The chapters on rotational dynamics, simple harmonic motion, and waves are an excellent review of concepts that will be required for future study of basic quantum mechanics. There are three nice chapters on special relativity. The reader may also want to check out Collier's A Most Incomprehensible Thing.  As stated elsewhere electromagnetism and quantum mechanics are planned in the second volume of this book. Be warned that the author inserts many jokes that are not that funny."

Before reading this book,you should be familiar with the basics of differential and integral calculus. If you haven't taken calculus yet, I would recommend checking out MIT's Single Variable Calculus lecture videos and notes [...] . The textbook that MIT uses for single variable calculus, \"Calculus with Analytic Geometry\" by George Simmons is an excellent introduction to calculus, but if you are looking to save some money,Calculus: An Intuitive and Physical Approach\" by Morris Kline is an excellent book and it only costs about $20."
