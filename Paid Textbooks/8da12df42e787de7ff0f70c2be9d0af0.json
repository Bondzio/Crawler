                "Text": "This book is primarily for experienced mechanical engineers or those with an innate talent for looking at drawings of mechanical devices and grasping the theory of operation. It is not a textbook by any stretch of the imagination. There are no equations, analyses of operation, or vector-space drawings as you would find in modern mechanical engineering textbooks. However, as an idea book for mechanical engineers at its very low cost it cannot be beat. The Amazon title page says it is copyrighted 1995. However, the book was written in 1868 and its content remains unchanged from that date of publication. The language is therefore flowery and somewhat archaic as you can see from the book's complete title: \"Five Hundred and Seven Mechanical Movements, Embracing All Those Which Are Most Important In Dynamics, Hydraulics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Steam Engines, Mill and other Gearing, Presses, Horology, and Miscellaneous Machinery: and including Many Movements Never Before Published and Several Which Have only Recently Come into Use\". The book's format is quite simple: On one page you will see 8-10 drawings of mechanical devices. On the opposite page you will have a paragraph or so each describing those 8-10 mechanical devices. If there are any equations being spelled out it is done via prose, so you may need paper and pencil in hand to write in equation form what the author is telling you about the theory of operation. I think it functions well both as a history book for mechanical engineers and as a source of ideas of how mechanical devices can be combined to create more complex machines. I highly recommend it, as long as you understand what you are getting."

The drawback is that the movemnt is shown in very limited form.  There is a word explaination with  drawings, but even still a single piscture may not be enough.  Great to  browse through and probably a handy referance for any one who is  mechanically inclined to produce their own stuff.  Fun book."

The good thing is that it is fairly inexpensive and you haven't wasted a lot of money if it doesn't fit your needs. A mechanical engineer would have no trouble understanding the text and interpreting the drawings. However, a mechanical engineer is not likely to need this book. If your interest in the subject is practical, like the actual design and construction of a special purpose mechanical device, I suggest you keep looking. There's probably another title that will serve you better."

I really enjoyed looking through all the mechanisms and I already have some ideas on how to implement them. Although, some of the drawings are too complicated to understand by looking at them, and the book doesn't go into extreme detail. One thing I did find useful is that quite a bit of the items had the name of the movement so you can do your own research on those particular ones. I'm quite pleased with my purchase overall."

The cover is modern and promises a high-quality treatment of an interesting subject but the inside is ridiculously simplistic and leaves an awful lot to the reader to figure out on his own.  The extremely abbreviated text is arcane and the \"pictures\" are no more than primitive line drawings.  In many cases, this is woefully inadequate to understand what's going on.  This 1868 book belongs in the \"Antiques\" section.  It was a huge disappointment and simply annoying."
