                "Text": "Those who have read Gleick's biography of Richard P. Feynman (Genius) have probably also read this collection of Feynman's \"best short works.\" This is indeed an odd collection. Feynman is most accessible  in the interviews and speeches; least accessible in his \"Minority  Report to the Space Shuttle Challenger Inquiry.\" Gleick's biography  reveals a man who exemplifies what Whitman had in mind when he observed  \"Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am  large. I contain multitudes.\" Feynman was indeed large; he contained  multitudes. To read this book is to share the pleasure of his company as he  formally and informally shares his thoughts and feelings about himself, his  life, his career, and just about everything else which attracted his  attention. Chapter 1 (\"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out\") and  Chapter 8 (\"What Is Science?\") are my personal favorites. The  aforementioned \"Minority Report\" (Chapter 7) was, for me, tough  going. As I worked my way through this collection, I began to think that I  was in the company of someone who has Albert Einstein's intellect and Danny  Kaye's personality. Feyman must have been a flamboyant (albeit demanding)  classroom teacher. There can be no doubt about his intelligence. Nor his  passion and compassion. Nor his playfulness. How much I regret never having  known him personally. Therefore, how much I appreciate this collection  which I continue to re-read with joy."

This man had an awesome life that anyone interested in math or science would aspire to.  The book is interesting and easy to read. I'm in 11th grade and I can understand it, so anyone who is at all familiar with physics and has a decent mathematical background will do fine reading it."

However, the true gem here is his philosophy that keeps peeking out: doubt everything - test it for yourself; and have a child-like wonder of the universe.  His sense of humor also jumps out and makes you laugh out loud.  This book covers a wide range, from his early adventures to his later musings.  I recommend it to anyone who is curious about how to find out for themselves how things work."

They were more anecdotal and  disjointed, all in all, not a whole story, as I might have liked.  This  does not detract from the book at face value, which reads great and, at  that level, is a wonderful book.  Other books attempting similar things,  however, are much more detailed and read with full plots-- Sobel's  Galileo's Daughter and the Zoland book Nabokov's Blues.  But perhaps what  the editor preferred here was something more general and disjointed since  the subject is a celebrity anyway.  I did not find this a problem once I  realized what the book seemed to be attempting; I think I got spoiled by  reading other scientific \"biographies\" with a real plot.  Yet,  for anecdotal charm, wit, and poignancy relative to some of the problems of  our times-- like Challenger and all it symbolized for America-- this book  still hits hard."

I hadn't previously seen the Omni interview, which described how the discovery of the Lamb effect in 1947 spurred Feynman to  finish his formulation of QED.  The interview has Feynman saying that the  measurements were done by Lamb and Rutherford, and the  biographical  footnote on the page correctly dates  Rutherford's death in 1937.  (Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus in 1911 when he noticed alpha  particles scattering backwards from atoms instead of going through as  everyone would have assumed.) For some reason, the editor didn't catch the  inconsistency (the co-discoverer was actually Retherford, not Rutherford).  There are other indications of editorial sloppiness, such as the editor's  statement in the preface that light is slowed down in glass or water by a  fraction of a percent (compared to the speed in vacuum).  It's more like 30  percent, as anyone who has taken high school physics may remember.  I think  Feynman deserves better -- the editor should have run this book by a  physicist before publishing it."

Feynman does a convincing job attacking the \"pseudoscience\" practiced in many fields: politics, social science, psychology, and laying the ground for improvement in these areas.  He also tries and in my view succeeds in describing the mind and process of a true scientist.  He then crosses over into religion and philosophy which he manages well, even if it is apparent that he is not a strong believer in God and that he thinks most philosophy is garbage.  I will be reading more Feynman."

Still not a big fan of books made from assorted papers because they just don't flow well. It is much easier to read them when the person is interesting. Some folks are critical of Mr. Feynman's antics over the years. He just seemed playful, curious and refreshingly honest. Most people try to hide their weaknesses, especially those in the sciences. Not him. He openly discussed his quirks and personality flaws. He loved what he did and seemed happy. That showed throughout the book. But he was not refined, cultured or overly full of himself. He cherished his working class upbringing. I found him endearing and funny yet a few of his activities would not have been something that would appeal to me. There was less information on his scientific pursuits and the value of his contributions than I thought there would be still it was a fun read over all."

He was the youngest brilliant mind working on the atomic bomb in Los Alamos in the 1940's and later won the Nobel Prize in physics. This book is an unintegrated collection of essays, transcripts of speeches, interviews and memoirs. As such it gets repetitive. We hear three or four times about how his father taught him to observe and we hear three or four times the identical story about the Cargo Cults in New Guinea after WW II. His father, who was not a scientist, turned out to be an excellent teacher specializing in teaching his son to learn by observing. Feynman and his school buddies also had basement \"workshops\" so that helped their intellectual development. It's fun to see a mind at work, punching the envelope, too undisciplined and too powerful to be contained within a skull."

He is not the ivory tower type of intellectual. He was extremely curious and had a knack for Math and Physics and was able to put it to good use. What's really good about this book is it gives a glimpse into how true scientists think and how it starts from childhood. He talks about scientific integrity and a few other amusing non-scientific things. He also mentioned in this series that he would see equations in different colours. So the 'j' would appear tan and another part of the equation purple...so he probably had savant like qualities without the awkwardness of regular savants."

I did skip a few sections that I found less interesting, but it is a book that lends itself very well to skipping parts, due to the short segments and frequent shifts in topic. There are also several things repeated in his texts, possibly because he was particularly fond of those examples, but it didn't subtract much from my enjoyment of the texts."

Still worth reading, absolutely, just don't expect the same level of interest, humor, scientific detail, or just about any other aspect to be consistent from one section to another. This makes sense, as the book is a collection of items given to - and intended for - different audiences at different times. Unfortunately, at least for me, the inconsistencies meant that I could barely put the book down while reading some sections but found myself preferring other reading material over Mr Feynman's musings while working my way through the others."

But it's painful to read this book from this publisher - Basic Books of the Perseus Books Group. The book paper is not of good quality. I can live with that. But font is so bad. In the middle of some paragraphs, a line is changed to smaller font. It happens all through the book. It just make my eye sore. I will avoid this publisher as possible as I can in the future."

                "Text": "Richard Feynman is a cultural icon, inspiring imitation, adulation and  idolatry.  But he was also a con-man who made a virtue of his many vices.  Certainly he was an exceptional scientist, else he would not have won the  Nobel Prize.  But culturally he was an ignoramus, linguistically--a kid,  and professionally--a superstar who shirked responsibility and played the  role of maverick, even as he enjoyed all the professional percs.  He  persuaded everyone that he couldn't help it:  he was interested only in  finding out how things work and could devote himself only to that.  Others  could do the busywork, run the world and educate themselves.  This ploy  worked so well that when he spoke in his jerky 1940's plain-man language it  seemed that he was bringing elevated subjects down to earth, making them  simple and easy for the common man.  Actually he couldn't construct a rich  sentence or a weighty paragraph.  The same when he spoke about history or  religion--it seemed that he had unpeeled the manifold layers of cultivation  and interpretation.  Actually he only touched the first layer.  If you  imagine in this collection that it is not he, Richard Feynman, speaking,  but anyone else, you will discover that most of what is said reaches the  level of only a bright teenager.  Even when he speaks about science, he  spouts platitudes:  always doubt, always test, etc.  Yet, for all that,  there is something to be said for a great scientist who did not advance  beyond being a bright teen.  In these lesser articles and addresses,  Feynman appears with all his mannerisms, shortcomings and insights, an  original character if ever there was one.  His remarks are amusing,  irritating, stimulating and sometimes even inspiring.  You can't fail to  marvel, but you can stop far short of idolatry."

I had to read this book for school. I got nothing out of it, except the ignorant and close minded thoughts of the author. The grammar was also terrribe. It wasnt written in a way that one could follow. I had to use my imagination to kind of figure out the authors feelings of whatever he was talking. It was written in a way as if he was actually talking to in person rather than through a book. But I do have to say that it was different. I guess if you are into and study science it is the book for you. But its not really a book to learn from. Instead its more like a book to say \"Oh! I feel that way too.\" To conclude, I dont know what to say to those of you who are into science, but to those of you who do not have much of an interest in it i would reccomend that you choose another book."
