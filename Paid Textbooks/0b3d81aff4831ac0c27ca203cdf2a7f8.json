This is an entertaining, informative, and thought-provoking book that examines a wide variety of acoustical effects.  It may be a bit light on the science and a bit basic for the acoustical engineer, but for a lay person, it should be quite enlightening.  Unfortunately, the audio edition did not fully capitalize on that medium to convey examples of sound described in the text, but it was still a quality production, Jonathan Cowley, the narrator, having a great voice and style for delivering the content."

If you're an audio engineer or lay-person interested in the way sound works in our world, you'll enjoy this book. From natural phenomena to man-made artifacts, both old and new, the way sound works in our world is intriguingly explored in a very easy to read manner. This is not a technical book, nor a difficult read - and neither is it unnecessarily dumbed-down either. Get it. You'll enjoy it!"

If you don't enjoy this kind of knowledge for its own sake, you might not find it fascinating and probably won't read through to the last chapter.  However, if you are intrigued by the detail of nature surrounding you, Mr. Cox's skill with phrasing and pace will support your glide through often repetitious materials.  My read has been a chapter at a time and I must admit that I have yet to read the last chapter, but only because I left the ipad on which I'd downloaded this book on an airplane."
