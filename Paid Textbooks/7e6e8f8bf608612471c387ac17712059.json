                "Text": "Last week I was having dinner with friends in a restaurant in northern New Mexico. All physicists, slightly drunk, we were debating as different topics as \"why did Hannibal not march on Rome after annihilating its legions at the battle of Canne?\", or \"how could those 19th century guys figure out a concept as like entropy BEFORE knowing statistical mechanics\", when many lamented how unnatural thermodynamics felt as undergraduates, and how all textbooks were perhaps not incomplete but incapable of convey the physics. And then I said \"well, there is Fermi's Thermodynamics...\" end soon everybody agreed. My freshman course in thermodynamics, in Italy, was based on this book: although it is short and concise, no other text has its compelling clarity in explaining the basic laws. And it has that distinctive Fermi style: cutting the crap, straight to the physical point. Undergraduates learning the subject on any other book are really missing out."

                "Text": "A great physicist stands at a higher position than others in teaching. I studied thermodynamics from many other authors, and some of them are also really good. Nevertheless, Fermi has extraordinary clarity and he always explains why we should introduce something very convincingly. For example, do you feel uncomfortable when you first study thermodynamics and you have to touch the Carnot cycle? Why we need to study the \"thermo-engine\" if, say, you will not touch anything on mechanical engineering or a refrigerator? I felt uncomfortable before, since I study this subject only for the sake of condensed matter physics and some chemistry disciplines. However, Fermi first states the equivalence between heat and work, then he argued that it is easy to transform work into heat, because we can do friction!! Then a question arises NATURALLY how we can inversely transform heat into work. Even if one do not want to do any engineering about thermo-engine, he needs to think of this NATURAL question seriously. The problem is then, we do not have many ideas, the only good one at hand, is some reversible cycle to release net work, and then I feel motivated to study the Carnot cycle. This is great. More importantly, the EASE to transform work into heat and the DIFFICULTY to transform heat into work is a core aspect of Second Law, which I never thought about before. Another example, in the First Law, Fermi writes in a way very much like a realy physicist. He does not force the reader to accept some argument, but he let the reader to estimate the consequence. You either prefer this argument, or you may question the energy conservation law. (Physicists think in this way, for example, N. Bohr used to want to abandon the energy conservation law in beta decay, but he was wrong in that) Such way of thinking and writing attract me very much. Anyway, Fermi is Fermi and his small book on thermodynamics is excellent."

This text is succinct with few examples which I personally enjoy since I can read the entire book fairly quickly. It is well written and hits all the major concepts. Fermi does a nice job of giving interpretations to formulas where appropriate and provides proofs and derivations. This is exactly what I was looking for. The text is excellent as a brush-up text. However, if you are looking for an introductory text, you would be better off buying a larger text which includes more discussion and provides more examples. Also, this particular book has many minor typos. It is never a problem to catch them almost immediately but it is a bit distracting."
