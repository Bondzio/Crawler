                "Text": "This book introduces the reader to the basic mathematical structures of theoretical physics: mainly Quantum Mechanics, Electromagnetic Theory, And Classical Mechanics. I used this at UC San Diego for a year long graduate  course on Mathematical methods in physics and engineering.  If one has the  time, there is really a lot to be gained by carefully studying this book. A  big part of the book is geared toward developing in detail the mathematics  of the Quantum Theory. This is a good thing because in my experience most  QM books are too eager to \"get to the physics\". It is true that  you can get by with a superficial understanding of functional analysis and  still do QM, but this book will give you an immensely deeper understanding  of the underlying structure of the theory.  In particular, the  treatment of Green's functions and integral equations is good. There is  chapter on Group Theory and it's uses in QM. Also is a chapter on Complex  analysis, although it is a wise idea to read a book entirely devoted to  this subject. Overall, I like this book very much."

The authors understand to invite you into in a never boring journey of deeper understanding. It would have been wise for me to study this book when I began with the graduate level of my studies. I like the introduction to the calculus of variations very much. Finally the introduction of Green functions are more clear than I ever saw before. Simply  great, if I could get back in time this book would have helped me a lot."

This book, despite it's age, does a wonderful job of filling the gaps between undergraduate math courses in Linear Algebra and Calculus, and the mathematics that is used in these two foundational fields of physics. I highly recommend this book for any aspiring graduate student in physics, particularly after one has taken a good number of math courses and both classical and quantum physics at the undergraduate level, in preparation for graduate studies. In particular, it is best for someone who is interested in the details of the thoeries. It helped me a lot."
