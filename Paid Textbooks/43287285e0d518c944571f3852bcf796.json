Having said that, it was a tad frustrating to find the meat on the bone of the subject matter in the book. There are tantalizing clues and nebulous accounts of various time travel incidents throughout the book; however, the author doesn't provide any follow up or offer any attempts by him to contact some of the people involved in these incidents. Granted, some have passed away, some faded into obscurity, and what not, but due to the what I can only imagine is a world-wide fascination for most people with the very idea of time travel, I feel the author should've made the effort if he was able. If you're looking for that type of experience with this book, save your money. If on the other hand you are like me and would like to have a primer on the various reported/alleged time travel incidents then go ahead and get this book. You will enjoy it if you enjoy speculating about the \"what if\" but not if you want the \"show me the proof\"."

Several very interesting stories involving time travel and time slips.  All are fairly short, read the entire book in one sitting.  I have always been interested in time slips but it can be hard to find good stories that are not heavily slanted in one direction or another by the author.  This book is the exception, the author does a good job presenting you with stories and letting you make up your own mind.  Book is well written and easy to read.  Not to heavy on technical or physics jargon.  For the most part the stories are presented just as the person experienced the phenomena.  I recommend this book (and it's sequel) to anyone who has an interest in the subject of time travel."

If one really could travel back and forth in time, one could go a little ways into the past and change it, which in turn would change one's memory of it, but how then to explain why your memory failed to notice the changes?  Also, a man could go into the future and attend his own funeral, being both the corpse and one of the mourners.  Time travel implies the ability to be in two places at the same time."
