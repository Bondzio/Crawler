I compare it to the very best expositions: Landau-Lifshitz's \"Classical Theory of Fields\" and the first chapter of the first edition of Heitler's \"Quantum Theory of Radiation\" ."

I was fascinated by the perfect logic of the approach, which took full profit of relativistic invariance to shorten and clarify the whole theory. I wonder if the book by Melvin Schwartz took Oppenheimer's text as a model. It has the same elegance and logical structure, yet it is a little more leisurely written, being a textbook.It is, so, closer to perfection."

Amazon is still butchering mathematics and science texts with this mobi thing. Extremely poor mathematics rendering and rendering of figures. Flowable text works fine for books that are just text like scifi or romance novels and so on. For books like Schwartz's they need to be using print replica format or completely reset the book using html5 and mathml and credible rendering engines. It's really sad to see beautiful texts like Schwartz's Principles mistreated in this way. I hope we aren't going to see a whole series of poor republications of Dover books. That would be a real shame."
