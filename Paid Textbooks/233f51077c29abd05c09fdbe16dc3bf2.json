It is concise, readable, and not over-rigourous; perfect for people new to the field who need to \"come up to speed\". Although there has been a spectacular growth in optics and photonics in the last 25 years, the fundamentals one needs to work in the field have not changed that much, and Fowle's text covers the optical bases well, from polarization to interference to lasers to non-linear optics; it's all here in a condensed readable format."

I still rely on Fowles as a frequent reference, especially when deriving Fresnel eqns from Maxwell's eqns, solid state refresher, and intro to quantum theory."

I found Fowler's book to be fairly useful, especially since I got to see optics from two different perspectives.  The one really good thing about this book is it's price, and makes it a good reference book.  The downside is that since it's quite short, it doesn't cover everything, moves fairly fast, and has no examples.  For the price I paid, however, I am quite satisfied."

This text can be used by anyone with a little bit of math preparation (at least multivariable calculus). This book is the right price and size (covers everything of interest for a semester long course without wasting pages) for a junior- or senior-level undergraduate exposure to fundamental optics (it covers a bit less material than Hecht). I highly recommend this text to anyone who wants an easy reference or a learning text for basic optics."
