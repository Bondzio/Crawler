                "Text": "This majisterial work by the famous Russian physicist/astrophysicist Yakov B. Zeldovich is the first and last book to refer to when studying the hydrodynamics of compressible fluids at high temperatures.  The author's primary goal is to describe (as well as possible in a roughly 1000 page text) the physics, chemistry, and radiation diagnostics (i.e. radiative transfer) of a 20 kt thermonuclear explosion in the atmosphere.  This book will be of use to a wide range of physicists and astrophysicists in other areas of research as well, though.  The book begins with a (brief) discussion of the basics of the physics of shocks (and the hydrodynamics/thermodynamics of supersonic flow in general).  More detailed topics include a detailed discussion of the ionization of the air (i.e. a change of adiabatic index from 7/5 to 5/3), the broad band spectrum of the explosion, and many others.  Any absolute must have for any scientist studying compressible/supersonic flows."

The mathematically correct presentation of most of the relevant physics quickly enables applied mathematicians and engineers working in these disciplines to achieve the level of understanding necessary to start producing useful results.  It can be read in its entirety as a solid introduction to more specialised topics or simply serve as an excellent reference.  And the price of this beautifully reprinted volume from Dover is irresistible."
