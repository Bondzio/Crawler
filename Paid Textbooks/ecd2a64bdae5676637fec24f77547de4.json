                "Text": "Thermo is hard for two reasons. The equations are messy, and the properties are so abstract. Van Ness deals directly and only with the second problem.  His discussion of energy functions and energy transformations just as rules between observables is very helpful. Using that notion to get at what he means by a property and then making entropy understandable as a PROPERTY of a system is the core of much of the book. The derivation of some basic stuff in statistical mechanics is quite clear, and the logical relationship to classical thermo is very clear. An index would be nice."

This it not a stand alone text, but a supplement to a text book or more advanced reference.  This author explains in detail (and without a lot of mathematical mumbo-jumbo) the basics of thermodynamics.  It is geared toward the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student in engineering or physics who wants to understand thermo.  The mathematics is simple (anyone with a little knowledge of calculus can handle it), so the reader won't get bogged down in the equations.  If you really want to get a handle on what thermo means (beyond just manipulating equations), this would be a great place to start.  This book contains the best discussion of entropy that I've ever found.  The notion of entropy is a difficult one for many new to thermo.  It is easy to learn how to manipulate the equations, another thing to really understand what they mean.  The latter is the author's goal in this book, and he has succeeded.  At less than $8, this is a no-brainer."

Upon starting the book, I quickly realized just how much calculus the author assumes the reader knows.  I did study calculus also--about 30 years ago--and even tho I enjoyed it and did well at it then, my skills are rusty.  At first I welcomed a little review but about halfway thru I just got bogged down with the calculations and was unable to continue.  Surely there are ways to explain TD to an interested lay reader that don't require familiarity with calculus.  I'm still interested but I'll be looking elsewhere.  If there are any reviewers who have suggestions for alternative books, please let me know."

It will make your first few lectures much easier and simple. If you already have a basis in thermo then this may be a little too light for you but it is interesting either way so if you are extra curious or love thermo then go ahead and purchase."
