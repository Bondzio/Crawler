                "Text": "I purchased Continuum Mechanics by Spencer as a reference material for the first year gradate class on continuum mechanics. I got this book a month ahead just to get ready for the class. I think the book is wonderful particularly in regard to the intellectual depth of the author on the subject and his proficiency on the mathematics involved. But the very strength of the book may also be a huge drawback for particular audiences. The development of the concepts and the mathematics behind it virtually lacks consideration for beginners. Although I could follow significant portion of the mathematics and language presented, I could not form a coherent understanding of the broader concept. Fortunately, as I now actually get lectures in class, things start falling onto the big picture. Once I'm done with the class, I think this book will serve me better. But as of now, I'm going to stick with Schaum's Outline, which I purchased also from Amazon just after getting this book, as a reference and source of problem sets. If you are an undergrad or first year grad student getting ready for your first continuum mechanics class, get Schaum's Outline instead. You might also want to consider purchasing Schaum's Outline on Linear Algebra for review."

I appreciate the inexpensiveness of this book and given the choice between buying this or another text, I would choose this text.  However, there are times when as a student I find myself looking for more explanation and find myself consulting more in depth texts from our library.  In short, would I buy it again given the price? Yes. Is it more than an intro? No."
