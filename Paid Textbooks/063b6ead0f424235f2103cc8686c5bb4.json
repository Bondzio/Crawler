                "Text": "As a mathematician who doesn't generally enjoy popular math books, I found Mathematics and the Unexpected to be quite pleasant reading.  Instead of being a treatise on the enjoyment of puzzles, I think it conveyed much of  how mathematics is integral towards human understanding of the world around  us.  I have recommended it to my non-mathematician friends, to the point  that my copy is on permanent loan."
