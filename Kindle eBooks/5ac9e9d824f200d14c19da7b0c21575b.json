This essay (for it is an essay and not a full-sized book) reminds us that before E = MC^2 became a well-known equation (the equation itself appears nowhere in this work) and before Einstein himself became well known, it was necessary to justify his complicated mathematics in order to account for the absence of the ether in Einstein's conceptions of the cosmos.  While it is strange to think that Einstein's works and the man himself were long obscure in the English speaking world, it is worthwhile that this work helped to familiarize the world of scientifically-inclined Englishmen and Americans to one of the most striking and notable thinkers of the 20th century.  Although not as interesting as the (translated) essay from Einstein himself, this is a worthy historical artifact as a work that introduced English speakers to Einstein before he was famous, at the very beginning of the time when he began to draw the attention of contemporary thinkers despite the fact that his daring was initially thought to be immensely eccentric.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2NUJL7E1CJB6Y/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "#4,855", "Helpfulness": "78%", "Name": "Nathan Albright", "Location": "Portland, OR USA"}}, {"Date": "on September 18, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1QF3BCT8LRU1X/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #2,546,553", "Helpfulness": "39%", "Name": "atomicbohr", "Location": "retired in St. Pete, FL, USA"}}, {"Date": "on December 14, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ADSDAJJLOQZ01/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #489,610", "Helpfulness": "94%", "Name": "Gary D.
