In it Tesla explains his theories, and why he has done certain things. The writing/speaking style is slow and methodical. Tesla is very humble, but that belies his genius as an inventor and thinker. The reading at times plods along yet once read one can glean much about the man and his theories. I would recommend it to any wanting to learn more about Tesla."
