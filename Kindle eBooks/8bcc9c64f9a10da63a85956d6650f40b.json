                "Text": "Though Dreiser may be long winded, in The Financier he crafts an excellent story. Somewhere between Nietzsche and Machiavelli, Frank Cowperwood is an amoral and brilliant financier. With no responsibility and no semblance of obligation to anyone, Frank ruthlessly moves through the financial world to obtain his fortune. Following Frank and gaining insight into his moral philosophy is incredibly stimulating. One could certainly write an extensive paper, or perhaps even a modest book, on Frank's ethical system alone. Beyond that, the book also offers incredible insights into the rise of corporate capitalism in American literature in the realist period and captures the essence of the financial sector and speculation, on which Dreiser casts a harsh eye. The Financier is an underrated classic in American literature, despite Dreiser's sometimes questionable sentences and over the top descriptions."

You will read it and then want to read the whole series of 3 books which is cheaper and you will not have to page thru you Kindle one page at a time to get to the second book. It was a great story and I have just started the second one and it seems to be as good as the first. Enjoy!"

                "Text": "This book is simply fascinating. Despite the years that passed since this book had been written, it is still incredibly entertaining and true today. Some things never change: human ambition, jealousy, spite, cowardliness - all are the qualities that are still driving the human race today. The main character is a true maverick and his story is captivating. The overall financial backdrop is fascinating as well, as it very much relates to the state of financial affairs today - it only takes to read today's newspaper headlines to realize that although that financial markets today much more complicated, the underlying factors driving the financial markets today are very similar."

America is reverting to its Gilded Age condition at breakneck speed. I was particularly struck by the way Dreiser's description of politics and the law courts in Philadelphia in the 1870s mirror conditions in New Mexico in the 2010s. Change the names of the some of the details, and it exactly captures the way politics and law are done today out West."
