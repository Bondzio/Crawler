I'm usually horrible at multiplication off the top of my head so when I saw this I figured I would give it a try. The book is very well written and shows you some very good tips and methods for solving simple math problems faster. The book has a lot of information but is written in a way that makes it very easy to understand which is what I liked the most. I can really say that I've seen a big improvement in myself since getting this book.
