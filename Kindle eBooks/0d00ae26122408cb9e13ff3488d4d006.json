The answers are often gems in themselves --  things mentioned in passing and left to the reader to establish -- e.g.  \"... of the twelve ways that eight queens can be placed on a  chessboard without attacking one another...\"  At twelve years old I  spent many an hour finding those twelve ways.  There is a small problem  with the age of the book, first published in 1917. You could buy an  airplane for 400 pounds ($1,680) then, and the money puzzles in the first  chapter assume familiarity with British pounds, shillings and pence (and  ha'pennies and farthings).  The Dover edition of 1958 included a preface on  British coins and stamps, and another on the game of cricket, but this  edition was in 8vo rather than the original quarto, making some of the  diagrams very small.  I received my copy in 1936, at age eleven, and have  cherished it ever since.  I still find challenges in it in spite of my  Masters degree in Mathematical Physics!", "Helpfulness": 0.9722222222222222, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on May 10, 2010", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9411764705882353, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3NBPHTNBUUOAL/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #248,236", "Helpfulness": "79%", "Name": "batpox", "Location": "usa"}}, {"Date": "on July 19, 2006", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9354838709677419, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1AHG76Y8S89BJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #109,030", "Helpfulness": "86%", "Name": "David De Sousa", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on December 24, 2010", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1XXGMCKXTUFPJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #23,060,384", "Helpfulness": "54%", "Name": "J.
