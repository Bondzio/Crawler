The book offers several ways for me to show my students how much fun math can be. The author makes the point that when the number one appears in either the tens column or the units column of a two digit multiplication the arithmetic is greatly simplified in regards to multiplication. Other tricks shown make use of the special properties eleven and nine have. This is the first time I ever opened up a math book to a new chapter and \u201cgot it\" right away.
