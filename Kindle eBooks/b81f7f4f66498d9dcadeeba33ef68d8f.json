It was written in the historical, stilted language and shows that, at that time, there was a mix of the physical and metaphysical and sometimes what appears to us nowadays, just weird ideas about matter and energy.  We had a long way to go to get to a better understanding of the physical universe.  It's interesting from a historical perspective."
