I have found that the repetition and the uncluttered lay out of this learning aid makes memorizing the multiplication tables that much easier. This book delivers exactly what it says in its description: learning multiplication tables is all about repetition and more repetition for eventual instant recall. The tests and challenge sections are ideal for a grown up to sit with the child and help them by playing along with them.  I am glad that I bought this book, it has been a great help."

I do like the fact that kids could have this book on their e-reader to take with them at all times so they can get to know their times tables. This book is plain and simple and gets to the point of learning in a way that is sometimes the best, nothing distracts from the actual times tables this way."
