My young nephew was having trouble with his tables and it has really helped him.  I have found that the repetition and the uncluttered lay out of this learning aid makes memorizing the multiplication tables that much easier. This book delivers exactly what it says in its description: learning multiplication tables is all about repetition and more repetition for eventual instant recall. The tests and challenge sections are ideal for a grown up to sit with the child and help them by playing along with them.
