                "Text": "A great and engaging kick off of what promises to be a great apocalyptic novel. The world end type of setting can easily become a boring read without the right plot and intrigue - and \"Angle Wars\" definitely defeats any menace of becoming boring even from the this introductory part one. When human kind is threatened by the deadliest virus that has ever been seen, what happens next becomes intense, fast paced and filled with suspense. A good apocalyptic book, engaging and thought provoking."

It was a quick read, but was nonstop action and suspense throughout. As a deadly, contagious virus surrounds the land, a group of people from Hollow Creek must band together to try to fight it before the world is completely destroyed. The story takes you alongside them on their journey. 5 stars for me!"

The last page asked if you liked it and wanted more but no way to download the whole book.  From what I did read I found the story line jumped around a bit and it seemed like something was missing.  the dialogue did not seem like natural conversation to me.  The book also needed a good proofreader."
