The action involves a happily married couple who happen to be involved in a strange car versus truck accident that separates the two physically, each fearing the other dead, until the end of the struggle to survive spells out a degree of devotion that is credible yet amazing in its resilience.  It would appear this is the first novel by Jonathan Sturak and as such it shows a promise of well-developed story line and how to propel a novel along at a breathless pace.  It also shows where the author needs to polish and edit for his next work.  The description of the couple (Roger and Lois Belkin) is just so absolutely 'perfect' and passionate that it rings false: overkill on the degree of flirtation and intimacy in a couple together as long as the Belkin couple feels too saccharine, too out of focus.  Sturak also needs to decide whether he is writing poetry (his descriptive phrases are very heavy) or a pulp romance suspense novel.  This is a good airport book for a fast trip and it may even appear in a made of TV film - attributes that will likely guarantee high sales for this effort.  He will be an interesting author to watch grow and to see if his skills become more polished with each next book!
