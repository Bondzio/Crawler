                "Text": "This is a gripping suspense/thriller novel with an overarching romance theme. I really liked the character driven plot. It felt like I was on Roger's voyage as I read and once I got invested into the story, I couldn't put the book down. I never got lost in the story as the author has created a very realistic world. The pacing, characters, and rooting interest for Roger made this a great read. I recommend this to lovers of romance and thrillers."

                "Text": "CLOUDED RAINBOW is a fast paced little story about love and devotion and the extremes to which one can go to follow the heart. The action involves a happily married couple who happen to be involved in a strange car versus truck accident that separates the two physically, each fearing the other dead, until the end of the struggle to survive spells out a degree of devotion that is credible yet amazing in its resilience.  It would appear this is the first novel by Jonathan Sturak and as such it shows a promise of well-developed story line and how to propel a novel along at a breathless pace.  It also shows where the author needs to polish and edit for his next work.  The description of the couple (Roger and Lois Belkin) is just so absolutely 'perfect' and passionate that it rings false: overkill on the degree of flirtation and intimacy in a couple together as long as the Belkin couple feels too saccharine, too out of focus.  Sturak also needs to decide whether he is writing poetry (his descriptive phrases are very heavy) or a pulp romance suspense novel.  This is a good airport book for a fast trip and it may even appear in a made of TV film - attributes that will likely guarantee high sales for this effort.  He will be an interesting author to watch grow and to see if his skills become more polished with each next book!  Grady Harp, April 10"

I'm assuming all reviews that professed admiration for this book came from the authors friends and family. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It's only redeeming feature was that it was free. If I had spent even a dollar on it, it would have been too much. Ridiculous characters, dialogue and implausible scenarios abound. Don't waste your time with this drivel."
