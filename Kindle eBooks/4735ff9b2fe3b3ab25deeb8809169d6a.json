I cried through three chapters because I wanted to reach through the chapter and hug you Ivan! Not just because but because I understand what it was like so go through some of those situations that your dear friends did. I don't want to give any parts away but I cried, I laughed, and I cried and if this book doesn't fly off the shelves you are crazy if you don't get this book! It's truly amazing, wonderful breath taking, and you see yourself through the characters and the issues they faced. I'm going to zip my lips now because I'm not going to give any more parts away! Took me only two days to read it I couldn't put it down! Blessings Ivan! I wish you the best!!! Huggles!
