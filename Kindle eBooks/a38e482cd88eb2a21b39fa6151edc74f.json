The writing is TERRIBLE, the plot is weak, and unless you're 13 years old, high, or both, you cannot possibly suspend reality enough for anything that happens in the book to make sense.  You'll also catch yourself constantly asking,  \"What is happening here? Why is [name. any. character.] reacting like this? It makes no sense.\"  The book is clearly trying to be something like the Hunger Games (but oooh; with mind reading!) and it falls incredibly short.  You can understand why Katniss would be angry, but the heroine of this tale (with her seriously forgettable name) basically alternates between three states of mental being and none of them are even remotely realistic or interesting.  I can't stress this enough: even if you can read it for free, do NOT waste your time.
