The author is quite talented, as I found her writing refined and polished, and the story flowed along nicely. The character of Zoe is developed fairly well, but Dawson doesn't allow us much of himself until late in the book, perhaps to keep the 'mystery man' persona alive. Their sexual encounters are presented well, but most fall just a little short of my expectations. In other words, most of the time the fireworks weren't as explosive as I was hoping for. The ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, which I'll probably read. Overall, I liked the book and would say 3.5 stars are about right.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A306UFMRUW6OTV/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "#6,397", "Helpfulness": "90%", "Name": "bass player 61", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on April 28, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A14XE7ASEE3V0N/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #180,302", "Helpfulness": "71%", "Name": "Rachel", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on March 11, 2015", "Text": "This was a complete, standalone novella, with a HEA ending.

It is simply a fun, hot short story to get you a little horny but you shouldn't expect anything more. No getting to know the characters or empathize with any of them. Pure short term fun. It also doesn't seem very realistic in how fast Zoe finds herself engaging in these sort of sexual encounters after having a pretty mundane sex life before she met Dawson. Everything happens too fast and it feels unreal actually. Like a nice housewife fantasy which could only last until she gets off....Gotta hand it to the author though, the writing of the scenes is very powerful and it does make you feel hot.
