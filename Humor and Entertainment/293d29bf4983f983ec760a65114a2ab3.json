                "Text": "Readers of Edward St. Aubyn's Patrick Melrose series have been wondering what his next book will be like for some time now. Will it be similar to the 5 novellas he wrote previously about the odd, interesting, and sometimes flamboyant Patrick Melrose or would e go in a different direction and be totally different in his approach.  I can tell you that with Lost for Words he most definitely went in a different direction.  The dry humor and British sarcasm is still there in spades but if you were expecting something close to the Patrick Melrose series you definitely are going to be disappointed.  That said, Lost for words is an enjoyable novel and a quick read and if you are a fan of St. Aubyn's writing, you will certainly enjoy this book.  St. Aubyn's writes a book about a number of authors competing to win the fictional Elysian award--most definitely modeled after the Man Booker Prize.  In a comical way. he portray the approach of how authors go out of their way to get long-listed, short-listed, and then finally win the Elysian. One author can't stop sleeping with her agent and other authors while another is so depressed over not being shortlisted that he locks himself in a hotel room for two weeks to ponder his fate. Yet another author-an older woman from India--is startled by her recipe book making it to the short list after being submitted accidentally.  Oftentimes a comedy of errors, Lost for Words will keep you wondering until the end who will emerge victorious. I enjoyed the book and recommend it to all Edward St. Aubyn fans."
