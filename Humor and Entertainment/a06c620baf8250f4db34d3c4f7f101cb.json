Lain is a quick and fun return to what gaming should be and can be. Lain does an excellent job of giving the reader a solid little story that has re-kindled my intrest in gaming. The characters (based on D&D; 3rd's ICON Characters) are fleshed out and stay true to the character class they represent. Now I am not going to say that this new series is Dragonlance or The Forgotten Realms, its a little stripped down. But thats ok. This little novel is action packed and predictable, but its so FUN. The dialog is pretty funny and a bit hokey, but he only had 182 pages. Hopefully as the series continues, Lain will give us a little more seasoning and depth, but for now enjoy a quick fun read. Forget the grand morality plays, let Lain place a torch in your hand and a mace in the other. Explore the Savage Caves, and still be back in time for bed. A good start to a new book line. Looking forward to the Living Dead.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A12CJKTOZTI5W5/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #29,374,139", "Helpfulness": "100%", "Name": "fdailey", "Location": "Tennessee,  USA"}}, {"Date": "on May 24, 2003", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1EH2JOYIH1FHI/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #18,243,274", "Helpfulness": "82%", "Name": "Pat Luther", "Location": "Portland, OR USA"}}, {"Date": "on August 2, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3EL98YGZT8X4P/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #30,532,657", "Helpfulness": "18%", "Name": "lordanthrax", "Location": "United States"}}, {"Date": "on July 31, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8333333333333334, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2VMOBY7OG70AO/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #3,319,861", "Helpfulness": "86%", "Name": "Jonathan Burgoine", "Location": "Ottawa, Ontario Canada"}}, {"Date": "on October 30, 2002", "Text": "Fun book and brought back memories of my bygone gaming days.

It was a fine book to read, exciting and all that.
