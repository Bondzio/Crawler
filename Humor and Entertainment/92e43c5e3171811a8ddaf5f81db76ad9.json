Dry, boring non-fiction is - thankfully - going out of fashion in favour of a much more creative, story-telling approach. Non-fiction today, even if it is very factual and information-based, has to be interesting and - dare I say it - even entertaining if it's going to hold readers' attention right to the end. And this is where Jurgen's advice and guidance is particularly valuable, no matter what type of writing you do. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."
