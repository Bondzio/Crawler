Her narrative is clear and easy to understand, with plenty of  examples of both good and bad writing.  Even though I'm not a screenwriter,  I found this book very useful and entertaining."

Her  insights, intuitive nature, her ability and grasp of story ..both through  book and in person is a highly trained gift and a guide to those of us  finding our way in the world of story.

She shows you how to avoid the  pitfalls of stereotyping, how to make even minor characters interesting,  and how to add believable complexity. I think any writer who works with  original characters would benefit from this book. Dr. Seger gives clear  examples and is easy to understand without talking down to the reader. It  is the kind of book you find yourself using over and over."

                "Text": "I met Linda Seger several years ago when she lived in Venice, CA. and was making her living as a script consultant.  I had read an L.A. Times article about her work and thought she might be able to help me become a better screenwriter.  At the time, I was part of a writer's group that was hosted by Sam Locke, who had come to Hollywood after having had a successful Broadway play, \"Fair Game\" starring Ellen Burstyn.  I bought Linda's book.  I found it to be generic.  I paid her to read a script that I was working on about Navy SEALs (before the genre became popular) and to give me a story analysis.  Apparently, she had done her Ph.D. dissertation on linear screenplay structure.  I asked Linda if she was aware of \"Pulp Fiction\", by Quentin Tarantino which had a unique circular story structure.  Seger wasn't aware of it.  Her orientation was simply old school.  It is helpful when you interact with a writer who is open to new possibilities.  For instance, I found Amy Deardon who wrote \"The Story Template\" to be very receptive to my comments about how to simplify her in-depth analysis of why we respond to well-crafted stories (they all have a similar, definable structure).  Some writers are able to write about their craft.  Linda has no screenwriting credits.  Her 'how to' books are based on theory, not experience.  Linda now lives Colorado."

Some of its insights are sort of common knowledge where as other can be found in superior script books that don't focus exclusively on character (McKee's \"Story\", Trottier's \"Screenwriter's Bible\"). The book is from 1990 so many of the television references aren fairly dated. Seger also has a tendency to let quotes from other writers do all of the heavy lifting. The book would strengthened if Seger infused some flavor and a voice of her own but instead the pros are fairly dry. A decent supplemental book on screenwriting."

What I find particularly annoying are the endless quotations of writers, Linda thinks are important and famous, but who infact are - well - not so important and not so famous and serve up a lot of not so great platitudes. So why 2 stars? If you don't lose your patience, you may be lucky enough to find some bits you can actually implement and need, such as her examples on subtext."
