I had read an L.A. Times article about her work and thought she might be able to help me become a better screenwriter.  At the time, I was part of a writer's group that was hosted by Sam Locke, who had come to Hollywood after having had a successful Broadway play, \"Fair Game\" starring Ellen Burstyn.  I bought Linda's book.  I found it to be generic.  I paid her to read a script that I was working on about Navy SEALs (before the genre became popular) and to give me a story analysis.  Apparently, she had done her Ph.D. dissertation on linear screenplay structure.  I asked Linda if she was aware of \"Pulp Fiction\", by Quentin Tarantino which had a unique circular story structure.  Seger wasn't aware of it.  Her orientation was simply old school.  It is helpful when you interact with a writer who is open to new possibilities.  For instance, I found Amy Deardon who wrote \"The Story Template\" to be very receptive to my comments about how to simplify her in-depth analysis of why we respond to well-crafted stories (they all have a similar, definable structure).  Some writers are able to write about their craft.  Linda has no screenwriting credits.  Her 'how to' books are based on theory, not experience.

Some of its insights are sort of common knowledge where as other can be found in superior script books that don't focus exclusively on character (McKee's \"Story\", Trottier's \"Screenwriter's Bible\"). The book is from 1990 so many of the television references aren fairly dated. Seger also has a tendency to let quotes from other writers do all of the heavy lifting.
