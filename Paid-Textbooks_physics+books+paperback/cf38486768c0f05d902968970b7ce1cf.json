Quantum non-locality is not rare and does not disappear. The  Universe operates according to the principles of complementarity at all  scales - Kafatos and Nadeau established the particulars of this verity with  extraordinary adroitness in their watershed book \"The Conscious  Universe.\" The concept of non-locality as an implicate attribute of  the material world is borne out by three pieces of impeccably documented  science which are only now becoming generally known. Nicolas Gisin and his  colleagues at CERN proved that Bell's predictions regarding non-locality  were precisely correct. The positron-electron pairs they separated with a  Potassium Niobate crystal and shunted through 15 kilometers of fiber optic  cable, automatically re-oriented spin and polarity instantaneously to  maintain net-spin values of zero when one of the particle-pair was  accelerated through an electromagnetic field, to seven decimal points, in  repeated trials. The effective rate at which the information transfer  occurred between the particles is calculated to be at least 10 to the nine  times faster than the speed of light. Second, Vladimir Poponin has  demonstrated in his work with the DNA Phantom Effect that every molecule of  DNA exerts a non-local field effect on the material locale surrounding it,  which persists for up to 30 days after the DNA molecule source has been  removed. The importance of Poponin's work is that it proves unequivocally  that among living organisms, non-locality operates simultaneously with  chemo-synaptic neuronal processes at all scales and in all living things.  Finally, Donald Eigler's work at IBM's Almaden Lab's proves that non-local  holographic field effects operate in all things as an intrinsic attribute  of matter at atomic and sub-atomic scales, regardless of whether the  materials are organic or not. In \"The Non-Local Universe,\"  Kafatos has simply opened the lid to this Pandora's box by providing an  epistemological model which is carefully thought out, clearly articulated  and reasonably constructed. His model is absolutely right on the mark and  deserves to be read by anyone who is willing to look at this aggregation of  unimpeachable evidence with clear scientific detachment.", "Helpfulness": 0.9305555555555556, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A251DDT8LWEKYR/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #29,321,051", "Helpfulness": "93%", "Name": "David G.

The author's begin by suggesting the classical problem of Cartesian dualism is to be resolved by this new view of mind in relation to physics. While there is certainly a gateway to a new perspective on this tragic division, it is not clear how the broader confusions of ethics and values can enter either the classical or postclassical views of physical systems, yet the basic insight seems fruitful indeed on the way to a new synthesis. The book weighs in with Bohr's Copenhagen perspective resolving the long debate with Einstein. The book then proceeds to a provocative consideration of the limitations of current Darwinian theory, still enmeshed in the classical paradigm, concluding with a hope this new unification will help to heal the two cultures divide. I am always left to wonder quizzically at renewed hopes of finally bridging the Cartesian divide, for the problem is in part one of false terminology, and the lack of self-perception, more than self-division. The great Indian 'metaphysics' of Samkhya never had this problem because instead of two entities, it had three, all material. The division of mind and matter is a confusion of terms, and thus not open to solution by physics, a most debatable point itself, to be sure. None of this really negates the very fruitful connection now shown between mind and physical reality demonstrated in the new physics. Excellent book, one way or the other. May be read Kant also.

All  of this is true. Unfortunately they mislead through omission.  Nonlocality  and quantum entanglement are very delicate and very rare events.  A  physicist doing an experiment has to work very hard to keep a quantum  entangled system separate from the rest of the universe. Once the system  interacts with the rest of the universe, the quantum entanglement vanishes.  This is a well-known fact that all first year physics grad students learn.  (I should know, I'm a physics professor.)  So the whole conceit of the book  is wrong.
