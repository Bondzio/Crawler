The book is GREAT, OUTSTANDING, FUN TO READ, WELL ORGANIZED and EXPLAINS a lot about the every day physics we live in.  This book is a must for students interested in learning more about physics.  I am going to buy a couple of other titles by this author for my library."

This book covers a broad range of physics from Mechanics to Electricity and Magnetism. But the whole book is  a cartoon that creates most enjoyable reading. Whenever I get one of these  books, my preteen asks to borrow it! (He's also learned genetics this way).  Although it does not contain experiments as such, the presentations of  scientific history and principles are great. Definitely a necessary book  for older children, teachers and professionals...from The Science  Spiders(TM) Newsletter"

Overall, the book is enjoyable and humorous.  However, the constraints of actually teaching the material through the drawings do impose on the humor sometimes.  The book is accurate, as far as I can tell, and allows one to gain some understanding on how things work, from how the tides come about, to the motion of a gyroscope, to the Theory of Relativity.  One disclaimer that I must add, that should be obvious, is that unless you are sufficient in mathematics (genius) you will not know all the consequences that come out from these laws other than the ones provided to you.  I would have to recommend this for people over 12 years old, those who want to learn a little physics in a fun and entertaining way."

If you are an educator for students anywhere between the third grade and eighth grades this might be a good book to have on your shelf.

It breaks everything down into easy to understand explanations and the illustrations are very helpful in visualizing the concepts presented.  I've been referring back to it for years now.  It has also helped me in studying for the MCAT, to review physics concepts that I had forgotten."

I have to say it is very interesting and I read two chapters in one setting and I fell that I understand better what my son has been trying to explain to me. I think I will have him read it also so that he can use references from it to tell me what he is learning. I think this would be great for homeschoolers from 7th grade and up.
