The book is accurate, as far as I can tell, and allows one to gain some understanding on how things work, from how the tides come about, to the motion of a gyroscope, to the Theory of Relativity.  One disclaimer that I must add, that should be obvious, is that unless you are sufficient in mathematics (genius) you will not know all the consequences that come out from these laws other than the ones provided to you.
