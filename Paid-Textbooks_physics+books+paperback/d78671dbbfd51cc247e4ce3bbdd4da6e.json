'Anybody who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it' proclaimed Niels Bohr. Ghost is the clearest writing I have seen on this difficult subject. Guiding the reader through the thoughts of Bohr, Einstein, Schr\u00f6dinger, and Heisenberg, it sharpens the mind, and prepares one for an understanding of Aspect's ground-breaking work. Ghost is based on interviews with leading quantum physicists. It begins with the need for quantum behaviour to explain black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect. This is contrasted with electromagnetic theory, supported by Young's interference patterns. However, only Bohr and de Broglie could determine how electrons orbit the nucleus - as standing waves - thus explaining atomic structures and spectra. When Schr\u00f6dinger and Heisenberg described the behaviour of subatomic particles, Quantum Mechanics was born. So why fuss over a theory that has given us transistors and lasers? Photons, should they pass one-at-a-time through Young's slits, know whether there's one slit or two, and build an interference pattern (or not) accordingly. So does the electron somehow manage to pass through both slits simultaneously? Try measuring this, and we're led to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Einstein never accepted the intrinsic nature of uncertainty, believing in a hidden but measurable mechanism operating at the subatomic scale, below light speed. An experiment was needed that could display Bohr's ghostly, co-operation-at-a-distance (i.e. faster-than-light 'signals') between photons. Fifty years later, Aspect's experiment conclusively illustrated this. Today's physicists concur that the philosophical implications are staggering, and this book admirably opens the subject to a wider audience.", "Helpfulness": 0.9642857142857143, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3B4RHKVRT2UA0/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #30,026,279", "Helpfulness": "96%", "Name": "Jim Hyndman (miha@rmplc.co.uk)", "Location": "Abingdon, Oxford, England."}}, {"Date": "on May 16, 1999", "Text": "This book is a collection of interviews with various quantum physicists and it discusses the different theories that are being promoted in this century in regard to quantum mechanics.  While it appears to me that  the interviewer is biased in his own ideas regarding which quantum theory  is the right one,  (or the one he prefers)  there is a  sufficient variety  of physicists to insure that several different viewpoints are expressed.  Under this format you are then allowed to make up your own mind in regard  to how you think quantum physics works.  While the book makes no  attempt to say it has all the answers, it does let you know what directions  they are looking in.  Without going into too much detail,  I very much  prefer the direction that John Bell was going in, on pages 48, & 49.  This book is a very good read for those who are curious about quantum  physics but don't want to have anyone try and sell them on only one idea or  theory.
