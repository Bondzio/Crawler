                "Text": "This is probably Dr. Kaku's best popular work since Hyperspace or Visions.  Here is a wide range of scientific possibilities to be explored.  Dr. Kaku's gift is to make modern physics comprehensible to those of us without a mathematical background.  In this book he uses his gift to explain how the standard model and string field theory (which he is coauthor of) can be applied to contemplation of some of our most wildest scifi dreams.  The chapters are short and easily read in short sittings, which lends well to a book that stretches the imagination so dramaticaly.  Dr. Kaku is also careful to remain objective in discussing different theoretical approaches which is an admirable feat given some of the topics ventured into in this book.  If you enjoy cutting edge science, it doesn't get more cutting edge then this.  Thank you Dr. Kaku for yet another wonderful journey."

The greatest strength of this book is the presentation of recent breakthroughs such as the seemingly invisible \"metamaterials\" that disappear under a specific frequency of light, or the series of breakthroughs that can be achieved with the possible discovery of room-temperature superconductors.  Kaku is an appealing master storyteller (as seen in his appearances on The Universe series on the History Channel) and Physics of the Impossible is a wonderful book offering much food for thought."

The author divides his topics into \"nearly possible today\", \"possible in the remote future\" and \"nearly impossible\", or something like that.  I found his explanations of why phenomena like teleportation,  sophisticated robots, force fields to power rockets, etc. might be possible \"soon\" were not very clear explanations. At the other end of the book,  I think he should have dismissed ideas such as building a \"death star\" that costs 400 quadrillion dollars, or travel to distant galaxies with devices that require harnessing the energy of entire galaxies to do so, as mere fantasies rather than elevating them to the level of something worthy of substantive discussion.  In short, the author glibly crosses from science to science fiction without identifying some of the ideas as the latter -- he appears to do so just because popular books or movies were about some of them."

This is my first exposure to him and to his ideas and naturally, I am in awe; grateful too for his easy ability to bridge his world of physics to this little layperson. I immediately came here to order at least one of his books, and find out more about Dr. Kaku and his books written for the general public. I want to thank Amazon and the reviewers here for having the rating bar graph and forum for input. All is thoughtfully done, and helpful...thank you. So, my review is more a comment with gratitude attached for this review process available. To mention, if you can make the time, this InDepth interview gives three and a half hours, (booktv.org), of this amazing author and theoretical physicist talking about science in quite an engaging, personable way."

Kaku has an engaging writing style, and his physics is basic enough that most popular readers would be able to follow. However, I don't think people who follow physics regularly would enjoy the simplified science. I enjoyed this book, though I have one major complaint: Kaku would give examples of science fiction phenomena from popular novels. Apparently assuming that everyone has read all of these books, he almost always tells the ending of the book. I hadn't read several of these books and was quite annoyed since telling the end of the book did not add any merit to his own arguments. The book lost star-points because of this problem."

The universe and the multi-verse make sense, and allows us to stretch out and knead our brain cells like those weird grey rubber erasers you used in art class. The results were unexpected yet transient. You saw it for a moment moving into something else.

When the cover caught my eye in the bookstore I just had to read it.  Michio clearly and simply lays out a number of theories or inventions that have been deemed impossible and breaks them down into their physical laws and then categorizes them on their actually possibility.  A must read for anyone interested in theoretical physics."

It helps them grasp a better understanding of just how much running they will be doing. I remember when I took on Michio Kaku as a companion just before he began writing this book. We traveled to the Sigma cluster of the Medusa Cascade, and held conferences with the Ood brain and discussed the philosophical concepts behind the ethics of interfering with historical events on Earth. Kaku proved himself when he made a counter thesis to the theorized negative consequences that the Ood proposed to me. We then traveled to the American Civil War where Kaku helped Abraham Lincoln construct the first Mini-Gun to be used in the battle of Bull's Run. In their timeline, the Civil War lasted a single battle. But I digress, for we all know that in this parallel timeline Lincoln went on to become the world's first and greatest vampire hunter, single-handedly defeating Dracula, Lestat, and Count Chocula in a single bloody battle that lasted all but 42 seconds when he gunned them down with his Mini Gun. But, again, I digress, buy this book. I read physics books now. Physics books are cool."

It's very interesting and it's guaranteed to make you feel a thousand times more like a quantum physicist than you did before. This book really kick starts your imagination and makes you dream of physics, which no one would ever think was interesting until him or her reads this book. Michio Haku makes this book an easy read, especially coming from a physicist to your everyday person. Haku writes in a way that keeps the book intriguing, even when filled with the Quantum Theory, the String Theory and the Theory of Relativity.  It's definitely not like a text book. While Physics of the Impossible has just as much, if not more, information as a text book, it remains intriguing and simple. You don't have to have a strong scientific background to be able to read this book. Anyone interested in science-fiction would appreciate this book, as it applies fiction concepts into real life. This book could also influence readers to start dreaming big. It will encourage them to not always take the unlikely for the impossible. This book is very well written and I would recommend it to all."

I think physicists often think they have successfully distilled a concept down to the level of the average joe, but in reality they have not.  I was able to follow this book basically 100% of the time, and I'm just a layman.  Plus the concept itself of evaluating common Sci-Fi technologies is fantastic.  Sometimes I wished he went into a little more detail, but that's the price you pay with these popularized books.  It might be a little hard to follow at times for someone that never reads popularized physics books (might start with Hawking's Grand Design?).  I'd also caution average readers not to overinterpret Kaku saying many of these things are possible.  While Kaku often states that the technologies are centuries away, he will state examples of already-done experiments that seem somewhat close.  A reader that isn't careful might get too rosy a view of the likelihood that we will see many of these things in our lifetimes."

In his book, Kaku talks about \"impossible\" concepts, such as telepathy, teleportation, precognition, space travel, time travel, perpetual motion machines, and others.  Actually, he divides all \"impossibilities\" into three classes: those that are consistent with physics as we know it and actually exist in a limited sense or probably will in the near future; those that are consistent with physics as we know it, but will not be seen for centuries, if ever; and those which are actually impossible, based on our current understanding of physics.  The book is well written, very exciting, hard to put down, and relatively easy to understand."

He divides the chapters of this book into 3 levels of plausibility things that the laws of physics allow for, things it might based upon current theory & things that aren't. His explanations are well written & concise that even the lay person can understand what he's talking about. Overall a very interesting & unique book that laid the foundation for Science Channel's \"Sci-Fi Science\" which he hosted for 2 seasons."

The physical plausibility of each technology is discussed, and a rough guess of how long it might take to develop (if at all). As a fellow physicist, I thought Kaku did a good job of classifying each technology in terms of plausibility. The book doesn't go into much mathematical detail, as it it a pop science book. Instead, it reasons in terms of the general principals of scientific theories, which is arguably a more useful way to think about future possibilities. The book was an easy read, and very entertaining."

As someone who has always been interested in science and science fiction, I wanted to learn more, so I purchased Michio Kaku's book \"The Physics of the Impossible\" and was not diappointed. I give this book five stars because it sparked my interest in physics and was a fun read. He discusses all things impossible, including time travel which I enjoyed reading about. I would definately recommend this book!"

It explains some of the more detailed physics in a way that a non-physics person can understand and stretch the mind as well.  It contains a lot of history of what has happened in physics that has made drastic changes in the various fields of science.  The book moves along fairly well, without drowning the reader in information.  Highly recommend this book to anyone who's curious about sci-fi stuff and if we can possibly make it happen."

His levels of impossibility neatly partition the various concepts which have come up in science fiction into three levels of impossible, from \"we'll probably have it in the next 50-100 years\" to \"Forget it, this idea violates pretty solid known physical principles\".  He covers his topic with the same sense of excitement, humor, and wonder which make his Discovery Channel appearances so compelling and enjoyable.  Highly recommended.  I was surprised at how few science fiction concepts wound up in the third level of impossibility."

Dr Kaku goes into the various worlds of Science Fiction and pulls out fantasies that can become a reality in the near and not so near future.  He goes into depth on how physics can provide the answer to things like force shields and lightsabers.  He is a learner of English, so he has a few grammatical errors in the book. Also he focuses mostly on principles and less on how physics can make this a reality, so at times he is a little dry.

Along the way, a lot of the frontiers of very much NON-fictional science are discussed, and the reader ends up learning a lot. This format was a great way to learn a lot and do a lot of hard thinking about fictional inventions like force fields, teleportation, faster-than-light travel, and invisibility cloaks."

There is a lot of scientific information that needs to be understood.  Kaku provides a historical background for each concept, which I appreciated.  The chapter on psychokinesis is very interesting.  Psychokinesis is the ability to use the mind to move or manipulate things.  I did not know that psychokinesis is used in the medical field for people who are paralyzed.  The chapter on antimatter is a new concept for me.  I had to read this chapter twice to fully understand it.  I did not know that antimatter could be used as fuel to launch rockets in the future.  I also enjoyed reading the chapter about the real possiblity that invisibility could become a reality as scientists learn more about how to bend light.  Flying cars could also become a reality in the future, as scientific knowledge of magnetic fields progresses.  Kaku talks briefly about string theory as the theory to explain everything.  There is not too much information on this concept, but it sounds interesting to me.  The chapter on time travel is very interesting but rather short.  Physics of the Impossible is a very educational and informative book."

This books is even better than Hyperspace because it delves into many various concepts and then the author uses current technology and understanding (as well as his hypothecating about future technologies) to determine whether the concept is ever going to be possible.  For example, he discusses the Death Star (a la Star Wars) and concludes that eventually (hundreds of thousands or even a million years from now), technology may exist that can reproduce the planet-destroying capability of such a thing.  His writing is entertaining and though some of the concepts are frankly not understandable for the average person (including me), it's nonetheless still enjoyable to read it.  I've read some chapters multiple times."

The author goes through all of coolest sci-fi technologies and explains exactly where we are on developing them and what we need to do before they will become possible.  For example, we've made amazing advances toward invisibilty since 2006 and within a decade or two Harry Potter's cloak won't be very impressive anymore.  I don't have a science background, but luckily the book explains complex theories in a way that is delightfully accessible to anyone with an understanding of 8th grade science."

I'm anxious to share it with my son as he gets a little older, as I feel it will help inspire him to \"think big\" and dream of what's possible. Michio Kaku uses real science to explain the ideas and fantasies of science fiction in an intriguing and easy to understand way. The book is an excellent introduction to quantum physics for the layperson, although I would imagine it's too simple to be a reference for physicists. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and found it to be a fast read."

What I found was after the initial few sentences on the subject(death stars, time travel, etc.) the focus shifted away from the fantastic to the mundane and ended up reading like a technical manual.  The difference between 'why it's impossible' to 'how it could be possible' is subtle, but it makes the difference between dull and entertaining.  I did find the chapter on robots and artificial intelligence fascinating.  Unfortunately, it was the only engrossing chapter in the book and I was relieved when I finally finished it."

Star Trek stuff like phasers, transporters and forcefields are included -- and I've seen more detailed presentations in other books.  He approaches time travel with a less than skeptical eye.  Included are invisibility and matter-antimatter reactions as well as non-scientific topics like telekinesis and precognition.  Again, nothing new, all been done before, although Kaku did have a good section on parallel universes versus multiverses.  It took me a half hour to go through the whole book, admittedly skimming since I didn't find much that was new or unique.  I will mention that Kaku thinks that precognition is impossible, but I have a feeling, um, let's see, yes -- that this book will appeal to teenagers with an interest in science who have not already read all the other books of its kind already on the market or on the library shelves."

Unfortunately physics, especially quantum physics has the need to understand consciousness (not just for the collapse of the wave function). The author is arrogant and ignorant on the subject of consciousness, and assumes that consciousness can be explained by physics. In this he has it backwards. Consciousness, or conscious Bbeing is the fundamental reality. At no time is there any attempt to define consciousness (which I define as awareness and will which is force). Physics explains the color blue (for example) as an electromagnetic wave of such and such a frequency - which in no way is an explanation for the conscious experience of \"blue\". Nevertheless, the book is worth reading."

To me, it is a tired rehash of ground that Kaku and others have covered thoroughly before, and his knowledge of science fiction is nowhere near as great as he thinks it is.  Time he retired."

I tried several times to contact the shipper privately, but I never received a response there, either, and I still don't have the book.  Based on my experience, I'd say to stay away from this bookseller if at all possible, as you never know what you might get from them -- or not."
