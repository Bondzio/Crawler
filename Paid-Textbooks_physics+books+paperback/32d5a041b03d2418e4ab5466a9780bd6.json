Here is a wide range of scientific possibilities to be explored.  Dr. Kaku's gift is to make modern physics comprehensible to those of us without a mathematical background.  In this book he uses his gift to explain how the standard model and string field theory (which he is coauthor of) can be applied to contemplation of some of our most wildest scifi dreams.  The chapters are short and easily read in short sittings, which lends well to a book that stretches the imagination so dramaticaly.  Dr. Kaku is also careful to remain objective in discussing different theoretical approaches which is an admirable feat given some of the topics ventured into in this book.  If you enjoy cutting edge science, it doesn't get more cutting edge then this.

Kaku has an engaging writing style, and his physics is basic enough that most popular readers would be able to follow. However, I don't think people who follow physics regularly would enjoy the simplified science. I enjoyed this book, though I have one major complaint: Kaku would give examples of science fiction phenomena from popular novels. Apparently assuming that everyone has read all of these books, he almost always tells the ending of the book. I hadn't read several of these books and was quite annoyed since telling the end of the book did not add any merit to his own arguments.
