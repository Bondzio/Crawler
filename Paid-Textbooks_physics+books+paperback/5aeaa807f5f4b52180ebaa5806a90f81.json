It is, as is usual coming from the mind of a scientist, an extremely optimistic and glowing portrait of humanity's inevitable march of technological progress, with very little concern or thought put into the wild contradictions of modernity, how the forces of free market capitalism, democracy, environmental degradation, etc. will play out.  Scientists do not live in a bubble, and if the world is at war or swept up by revolution then science cannot function.

I feel like this book pretty much details much of the material covered in \"Physics of the Impossible\", and his show on the Discovery Science channel of the same title. Don't get me wrong, the book would have been a complete success if it wasn't for the fact that we've sorta heard it all before from him. I really wish he would pick a new subject to cover in his next book, or at least give us something new to ponder about the future of technology and physics. I personally think Dr. Kaku, along with Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Brian Cox, Brian Greene and Lawrence Krauss are among the best communicators of modern physics that we have available today, Michio Kaku being the better of all in my opinion. I've been both a fan and a follower since the fist time I saw him speak in his simple, \"Carl Sagan like\" tone. I think he has a natural gift of relating otherwise uncomprehendable subjects to the masses in a way we can all understand, which is why I give this book 4 stars. It's a really good book that will certainly make you stop and think, and definately has that page turning quality. I just think it would be really hard for Dr. Kaku to match the quality of his ealier book \"Hyperspace\".. That was the book that opened my mind to physics and the magic of science. Sometimes, we humans tend to outdue our own selves and make it hard to match what preceded our earlier accomplishments.

I listen to and watch a lot of science programs and there's very little here that I haven't seen/herd before. I liked his earlier books much better. He really knows how to bring a very complicated subject down to a layman's understandable level. But this book is about predicting the future and we all know how unpredictable that is (the Jetsons come to mind). They have been working on robots for decades that the common man could use and so far the best they have come up with is a relatively useless vacuum cleaner and a automated drink serving tray. We all want that robot that will do what the Jetsons robot could do. About five years ago I heard about a collage student that was trying to invent just a robotic dish washer that could deal with the dirty dishes from picking up the dirty dishes, scraping off the food, scrubbing the hard food off, washing and drying and putting them away. But so far I haven't herd anything successful in that project. It's just to complicated for a computer to tell the difference between the dirt on the dish or a printed pattern. That's because computers don't have the ability to understand anything and I don't believe they ever will. Even those cars that can drive them selves only react to censer input. The computer driving the car has no understanding like humans do as to what it's doing. He even predicts our doctor in the future will be an interaction with a computer. While I think that's possible I don't think the doctor's union (medical association) would go for that. To much money involed and would you really trust your health to a health diagnostic devise that's similar to our GPS devices. Anybody that has used GPS extensively knows it makes mistakes (like telling you to turn left onto a road that isn't there) I would like to see Dr Kaku write a book about all the work and successes that physicist's out side of the theoretical physics world have done. We the average Joe know little about there contributions to new and recent developments in such topics as new materials that have been developed like batteries that can be  made into any shape. But as with his Science Channel program SciFi Science Dr Kaku seems to be heading down the same road as the programing that has overtaken the Discovery channel designed to appeal to the beer guzzling, dumb ass segment of our society, or children under 16 years old.", "Helpfulness": 0.5, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A441R59DABT6E/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "#19,136", "Helpfulness": "76%", "Name": "J.

Parts of this book are mind blowing, particularly when discussing the possibilities of future space travel. Unfortunately, he allows his politics to largely skew the entire book. For example, he keeps referring to the ipcc when discussing global warming, and continues to cite their predictions at the end of the book. However, he completely ignores the fraudulent practices from the scientists of east Anglia, England, often referred to as \"climate gate\". In short, much of the \"data\" was fudged.... As a scientist, you would think to at least mention this rather than citing fudged data as fact simply to suit your political beliefs. He also assumes that nation states will weaken, citing the European union as an example... Ignoring the glaring fact that the eu is collapsing as we speak, and that most people are not too thrilled to have their sovereignty taken away. In short, I still highly respect him as a relatable and personal science, but please shut up about your politics...
