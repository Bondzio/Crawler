Mr Calle does a superb job in explaining subjects which are extremely difficult to understand if you use a standard text book. Reading this book myself gave me a clear understanding of quantum physics and relativity. I would really recommend this book to everyone who wants to start studying science before attending the real classes. The book does not have any equations but simplifies everything by figures and thought experiments. As I am writing this review I'm about to graduate with a masters degree in engineering and I truly regret that I didn't know about this book five years ago.", "Helpfulness": 0.9583333333333334, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AHN8LAGG3JY6O/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #13,008,273", "Helpfulness": "97%", "Name": "Lucas Jensen", "Location": "Vejle, Denmark"}}, {"Date": "on April 10, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AX4PKK022Y51J/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #27,795,522", "Helpfulness": "100%", "Name": "S.

It attempts to break down the very complicated world of physics that Einstein was so involved in.  It gives a great history of his life and those who influenced him.  It was an easy read in terms of the organization and language used, but make no mistake  about it, the topics, theories and concepts are not easy to understand at all.  I found myself reading certain concepts over and over again but still not able to follow - but I do not blame the author - I simply am not equipped with the mental capacity to follow Einstein's logic.  And that is OK - this book served its purpose in that it opened my eyes to how much there is to know and understand about how our world works.  Even if I learned only how much I have yet to learn, I am sure I am smarter for reading it.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AGB1YDTHIQ59V/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #187,195", "Helpfulness": "61%", "Name": "JAGMAN", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on August 13, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2GZKOMC2INTVQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #23,890,323", "Helpfulness": "100%", "Name": "venkatkrishna", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on July 2, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8333333333333334, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LZFWI88CFRN7/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #2,129,969", "Helpfulness": "85%", "Name": "Pippa", "Location": ""}}, {"Date": "on April 3, 2011", "Text": "Wow, when I bought this book I was hoping for a better grasp of Einstein's theories of relativity, and ended up gaining a much better understanding of physics in general. The author says up front that you can skip around if you like, but I recommend reading this book cover to cover. I found the way physics is explained through what Einstein understood (previously discovered physics concepts) and then wending into Einstein's theories truly helpful. The way the author weaves in other scientists and their discoveries in histories read very well and quickly. I've read this book in two sitting and got so much out of it. I recommend it to anyone interested in or struggling with physics. For those of you with a good grasp of physics, this book might bore you.
