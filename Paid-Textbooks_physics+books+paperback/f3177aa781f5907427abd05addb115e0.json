                "Text": "This book is fabulous for insight into scientific thought and dispositions on the most profound questions that exist for humanity. The book is compendious and wrought with intensive outpouring of scientific theory, phenomenon and information. So, to do yourself justice be prepared to read it at least twice. The time invested is certainly worth it. Paul Davies is a voluble and eloquent writer and I feel very respectful of his wide array of scientific knowledge, inferential discussions and deductions. But the work does have some severe short comings. PD attacks religion, and it seems evident that he very well may be upset about the sordid history of confrontation between the Church and Scientists, perhaps rightfully so. Sadly, PD's reflections on religion are strictly limited to Christianity. There are religions, like Islam, that exhibit a lot of harmony whith science and have a history of scientific discoveries too. PD is unable to draw a profound distinction between religious thought and religious institutions. A lot of people don't recognize institutional authority in religion, like myself. On the subject of God, there seems to be a lot of contradiction. PD, smartly, does not directly confute the existance of God. But then he totally discredits the life-force notion that drives the physical forces around us due to lack of a viable explanation. He says that science provides a surer path to God than religion does. But he does not give in to God as if it threatens his livelihood. Unlike Stephen Hawkings who openly says that human existance in the saga of the cosmos can only be explained as an act of a God who intended to create beings like us. Anyway, its a great read, very enjoyable and one of the most intellectually stimulating books I have ever read. Already looking forward to my 3rd read."

                "Text": "I found this book fascinating. Although Davies states that 'Science may offer a surer path to God that Religion' he states this only because science with its rational approach to the subject may more readily be  accepted by some than by faith. Davies does, however, finally state that  although the universe may have been created in the 'Big Bang' by itself  without any so-called 'Prime Mover'; that is, if quantum gravity acts in  the manner that quantum physics works at the atomic level. Given this, he  then makes the statement that the mathematics that describe the universe  must have been in place for this to occur. Davies is of the same mind as  Einstein here in that God would be necessary to create the mathematics that  created the universe."

                "Text": "Absolutely wonderful explananation of modern physics. Davies does a fine job of introducing the  many points of recent revolutions in that area. Now the philosophy/thoelogy, that is not so good. The man is a physicist and  should stay one, for his arguments and analysis in general is lacking. It  is not his conclusions that bother me, it is more like his thinking leading  up to them. As an avid reader of physics, and a current philosophy student,  I feel a much better job could have been done in bringing these two areas  together. All in all, a good book, I enjoyed it. A subject that deserves  further exploration and stronger, fuller analysis."
