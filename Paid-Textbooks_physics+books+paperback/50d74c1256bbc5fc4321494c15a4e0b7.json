                "Text": "This remains my favorite book for physics problem solving since I began using it in 1988.  From the basics of vector algebra to the principles of modern physics, the student will find a single source for solved problems  (both non-calculus and calculus based).  The mathematical notation is clean  and simple and the solution to each problem is found immediately beneath it  (not hidden at the end of the chapter or collected in the back of the  book).  The diagrams are elegant and clear, as well, with a minimum of  \"cute\" (and usually irrelevant) materials.  The student can add  this book to their reference library and it serves as one of the best  review texts for the standardized tests (such as the GRE and the MCAT)."

                "Text": "I took a General Physics I class last semester in College (I never took it in high school) and I was very lost for a while.  If you've never done a Physics problem and then see all these new concepts and see how much mathematical thought is required -- well, let's just say it's very intimidating.  As my instructor said, the only way to get good at solving physics problems is to do physics problems.  He advised us not to give up in attempting problems and to \"sleep on some\" and have a go at it again the next day(Great advice, by the way!).  With this book, and the abundant number of problems in it, ranging from easy to challenging, I was able to get an A in the class.  The author included in this book a \"Skeletons\" outline in the very beginning in order for the student with minimal time to get the maximum benefit:  mock homework, exams, and final exams.  Awesome book, I'm so glad I bought it... and I will be taking Physics II!"
