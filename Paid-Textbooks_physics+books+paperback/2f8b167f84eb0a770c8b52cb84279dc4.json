                "Text": "Physics is oftentimes considered the hardest of the hard sciences, and to many people it is one of the most difficult subjects to master. It is also my own chosen profession, and something that I am very passionate about. I find it to be an enormously fascinating subject, and I always appreciate new ways of sharing my knowledge of the subject with my students, friends and acquaintances. In my professional life of a college professor I find it continuously challenging to present the most important Physics concepts in such a way that is both accessible to the intended audience and it does justice to the field. Unfortunately even in the higher education there has been an increasing pressure to dilute various subjects in order to make them more \"relevant\" to the modern students. These attempts, however well-intended they may be, have the consequence of creating more and more generations of scientifically illiterate citizens. Fortunately, this small book does not subscribe to this misguided approach to science. The concepts and ideas are as part of the traditional Physics curriculum as they come. They are introduced in a playful, amusing way, and yet each short description is completely accurate and relevant. There are a few facts and numbers that help with describing each one of the concepts, but they are only given in sidebars and don't constitute the bulk of the material. In my opinion this is a pedagogically well founded way of presenting these concepts to someone for the first time. The illustrations in the book are extremely well done and serve the purpose of personifying various physical concepts and quantities. This may be particularly appealing to the young readers. I would also recommend this book even to the older audience that perhaps has not heard of some of these concepts, or has not really thought about Physics in many years. Overall this is an excellent low-level introduction to Physics."

Not really a textbook, but a fantastic introduction to physics for kids who read well on thier own."

This is another outstanding science book for children that not only teaches but excites them about the subject matter as well. The book arrived in the mail last week and on the first day my son read the entire book. Never fear however the subject matter is introduced well enough to entertain and inform in that first reading, however it is physics. He has and will I am sure continue reading, understanding a little more each time. He was disappointed that Physics did not come with a poster like The Periodic Table: Elements with Style. I do recommend reading the book thoroughly, if like me you are not into physics, before your child does. The conversations go better when you don't have to look everything up."

I bought it, but had little hope it was going to anything but a physics book with pictures for kids. And how wrong I was!! The text is cool, funny, and attractive, and at the same time it touches the concepts with fine precision. Clearly, the authors put a lot of thought when writing the book (and I DO respect a scientist putting his time to write a physics book for kids!). In short, it's a great book for young kids. Congratulations!"

The drawings are not especially cute or appealing, there are no stories to catch the imagination, no character interaction or dialog, nothing that would get a small child interested in the subject. Each page is just a disparate explanation of some single phenomenon or particle, with no connection to any other page in the book. The explanations are in the first person, as if the particles or phenomena were characters explaining themselves to the child. Some of them are a little cute or fun. Overall though they seem to me to lack much imagination or charm. And some of the explanations are just a bit dubious.  I'll try reading this to our little girl as she grows older, but I'm not too confident this will inspire any love of physics in her."

The presentation is really fun and it does make difficult concepts easier to understand. Each concept is presented as a character and it has inspired him to make up characters on his own. I think it appeals to that pokemon/superhero thing that so many boys are drawn to. All the books in this series have been great and I think if your child is interested in physics they will enjoy this book."

My 3 1/2 year old son wanted us to read him the books as soon as he saw the covers - so that definitely grabbed his attention. He has asked for them to be read repeatedly so it's not just a first sight curiosity. I don't expect him to really understand most of the concepts but it's good to introduce just the words and ideas into his head and he enjoys it.  These books aren't meant to be detailed explanations but are high level concept overviews and it does a good job at that."
