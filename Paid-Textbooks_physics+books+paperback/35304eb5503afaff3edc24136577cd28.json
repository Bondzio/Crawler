                "Text": "I purchased this to supplement my reading of the Feynman Lectures. I've never taken physics beyond a high-school level, but was interested in learning. The questions are helpful, but unfortunately a lot of the answer key is missing. So as a self-study student with no other resources, it makes it very difficult to know if you are grasping the material correctly. I would happily pay 5 times the price to have an extensive answer key, with some answers having an in-depth explanation as to how the result was arrived at."

For example, the first problem in the whole book asks \"If heat is merely molecular motion, what is the difference between a hot, stationary baseball and a cool, rapidly moving one?\" There are plenty of \"compute the force on member D in the diagram above\" type of problems, but also lots of ones to simply get you thinking about how all of this relates to the real world."
