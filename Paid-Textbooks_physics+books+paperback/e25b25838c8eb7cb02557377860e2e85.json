                "Text": "If you have Beer & Johnson's textbooks on either the subject of statics or dynamics you already have a great (and expensive) text. This one is inexpensive with great exercises, and a very affordable self-study text. The one problem with it is that, like many Dover books, it was written decades ago and the language is therefore somewhat archaic and can be harder to read than modern texts. However, the diagrams are excellent and the problems are very good. The answers to the problems are in the back of the book, plus several people on the web have set about publishing detailed solutions to the problems Hartog's book since the problems do tend to be excellent and well thought out. I highly recommend it as a supplement, but I wouldn't recommend it as your main source of learning the subject of engineering mechanics."

There is as much information in this little book as there is in texts four times the size and it is about 5% of the cost of those texts.  MIT Professors tend to know their subjects and Hartog  is no exception.  This books gives us enough of an insight into Statics and  Dynamics to leave us well grounded in the subject and with enough of an understanding of forces and analytic techniques to solve real world problems.  You'll need your math here - Trig and Analytic Geometry and an understanding of calculus to know what is meant by integration and derivative.  There are good example problems here, but a little slack on individual explanation.  One can always buy a used college outline paperback for that.  This book delivers the goods."
