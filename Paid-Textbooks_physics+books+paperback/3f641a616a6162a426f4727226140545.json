The writing is clear and engaging, thus making the book difficult to put down. Einstein's theories are clearly explained for anyone to understand, amidst the main highlights of his life and times. I recommend this book to a wide audience, from science buffs to Einstein fans to anyone wanting to understand what is was that made Einstein so famous, and why."

And the author in addition to being a physicist is able to explain, in a warm, and caring way, how Einstein pictured, in his mind, what eventually became his theory of special relativity. But there's more; Prof. Kaku provides us a glimpse of the life, thoughts, frustrations, and accomplishments of Einstein the man as well. An easy, and interesting read for sure."

I can only say that I created some inconvenience for rest of my family. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in science but not found someone to explain some of the principles in simple terms without resorting to scientific jargons.  It is like a history book for evolution of quantum and relativistic theories.  It is astonishing to see such a convolution of great minds occurred in early 19th century.  Had it not been for Lorenz, Dirac, Max Born, Riemann, Minkowski the relativity theory would have come at least 50yrs later.  This book give a chronolgy of Einstein's revelation of the mind of God from the language of abstract math."

The author offers the enjoyable experience of presenting Einstein's revolutionary concepts as the visual images Einstein actually contemplated when he saw the need to redefine the laws of physics and reality. Kaku does this in a clear and understandable way that gave me a much deeper appreciation of relativity. If you would like to review the well known story of Einstein's life with the addition of a picturesque explication of his strokes of genius you will find this book very satisfying."

This does not change the fact that Michio has a way of looking at every detail of Einstein's life from a slightly different angle, and presenting that angle in a way that gives the reader new insight into the conciousness of a genius.  There were multiple time's while reading this book that I found myself setting the book down and staring at a wall (at one particular time for more than an hour) contemplating the ramifications of the theories contained within.  After reading this book many of my questions have been answered, although I must say, an even longer list of questions are now floating around my mind due to my increased knowledge and understanding of relativity. My goal in life at this point is to sit down with Michio Kaku and ask him some of these questions, as his ability to envision and interpret the universe are unmatched by any mortal soul to date."
