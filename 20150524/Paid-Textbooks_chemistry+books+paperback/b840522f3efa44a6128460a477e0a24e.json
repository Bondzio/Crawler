                "Text": "i have been a long time fan of bodanis's entertaining way of exposing (i.e. the human body or the garden) the mundane in novel ways; this time around, he exposes the abstract in a marvelously mundane way. i finally understand the basics of e=mc2. i thank him so much. this book is a gem of a biography of the equation that we know but don't know. physics and the scientists behind the formulation come to life in exciting, vivid, anecdotal ways. i simply didn't want this book to end. now, can we ever really say that about other books on physics and science?  i haven't taken a calculus class in 25 years, but i was able to follow the reasoning and narrative flow with great ease. the hard stuff is thoughtfully stuck in the back in an appendix that is almost one half the length of the main section. bodanis has cracked this subject matter with perfect skill. and yes, i felt energized reading this book. hence, einstein's equation lives in yet another dimension!"

                "Text": "I loved this book.  It is a first rate physics primer that reads like a great mystery.  David Bodanis ( author of The Secret House and The Secret Family, which I also recommend )has a way of ending chapters with intriguing statements or questions that make it difficult to stop reading.  His treatment of the Allied Forces' attempts to sabbotage the heavy water facility at Vermork, Norway during WWII is a lot like a short Ken Follett novel.  Since finishing the book, I find myself looking for ways to bring up E=mc2 topics in conversations ( \"...speaking of smoke detectors, did you know that they derive the power to generate their smoke-sensitive beams from the radioactive decay of americium?\" or \"...just imagine, the glare from the explosion over Hiroshima would have been viewable from Jupiter\" ). This is popular science writing at its best."

                "Text": "The author of E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation, David Bodanis, has a writing style that is both engaging and informative. Not only does Bodanis manage to thoroughly explain the equation E=mc2 in a straightforward matter, but he also explains the history, and the results, of the equation itself. All the terms of the equation, energy, the equal sign, celeritas, and even squared, are described. The development of the equation and its various results are explained as well: the discovery of the atom, the details of the Bomb Race of World War Two, and the theory of black holes and stars. Bodanis felt the need to write this story because, \"Everyone knows that E=mc2 is really important, but they usually don't know what it means...There are plenty of books that try to explain it, but who can honestly say they understand them?\" This book is worth a read if you're interested in learning what E=mc2 really means, and don't want to become bored. Bodanis has taken a different approach to the equation; he doesn't write about the theory of relativity or Einstein, but writes about the equation itself."

                "Text": "I don't know how David Bodanis has garnered any praise with his book as it is not only full of poor explanations, but also completely incorrect ones.  Describing electricity as \"crackling\", mass as \"squeezing\" across an equals sign to be magnified into energy, and the product of fusion as \"ash\" is simply appalling.  His explanation as to why energy is proportional to velocity squared is merely an explanation of the concept of mathematically squaring a number, and his explanation of time dilation and length contraction describes the effects in slow motion without ever addressing why it happens.  Bodanis uses sources such as Goudsmit (a widely dismissed text) to depict Heisenberg as an ardent Nazi, and he completely skips Rutherford's experiment only to provide a ridiculously inaccurate description of his conclusions about atomic structure and the nucleus of an atom.  I am a physics and math teacher and have a degree in Aerospace engineering and I can confidently say that David Bodanis does not understand enough about his topic to presume to write with any authority and I discourage anyone from buying it as it is misleading and a waste of money."

However, his portraits of figures like Oppenheimer and Heisenberg are way off--extreme readings of uncited evidence that is frankly in conflict with both the historical record and the way that contemporary historians interpret it.  Heisenberg was NOT a convinced Nazi--he was a German nationalist.  There's a difference.  Oppenheimer's personality problems were not at the basis of his later exclusion from further government nuclear research--his communist sympathies were the reason.  Bodanis makes Teller sound like a crazy and not like the venerable scientist he was.  What's sad about all of these misportraits is that they cast doubt on things I want to believe, about Lise Meitner and Celia Payne, for example.  Read with care, and compare to a real book about the Manhattan Project (like Richard Rhodes' \"Making of the Atomic Bomb\") before you swallow this picture whole. For a much more balanced picture of some of the personalities involved that includes a readable account of the science, check out Freeman Dyson's \"Disturbing the Universe.\""

His descriptions are inaccurate and misleading but with enough of a veneer of credible-sounding science to make this book a true danger to the uninformed--readers will accept it without knowing how wrong it is.  Furthermore, but perhaps this is just me, his writing was incredibly irritating.  The tone he used was amazingly condescending and patronizing, which really annoyed me since it was clear he, himself, had no real clue as to what he was talking about.  According to his bio he is an intellectual historian--perhaps he should just stick to his own field rather than venturing into an area he has little understanding of.  If someone wants to read a truly excellent scientific history that makes difficult concepts easier to grasp, I would recommend Bill Bryson's _A Short History of Nearly Everything_, a hilarious read full of fun biographies of scientists and well-described and -explained science.  Bryson is also not a specialist and therefore has some errors as well, but they are rarely glaring or significant and for those with little scientific background, the basics of many fields of science will be delightfully illuminated."

From that the author became inspired to write this book.  I love the approach.  Each chapter is devoted to part of the equation and it explains the people behind it.  For example, \"e\" for energy.  Who were the people that made some of the early discoveries and connections in the field of energy... the book takes a biographical approach and includes a lot of women who were part of the science discoveries over the years, but didn't get recognition because they are women.  I am still reading it, but fascinated by the book and I know it will be one I keep going back to in my quest to truly understand what e=mc2 means.  It is a relatively \"easy\" read because the author approaches the science through the subject of the people and their interesting lives and stories.  a great read even for people who are not big science nuts (which i am not)"

                "Text": "Bodanis is an expert on intellectual history, not on any one type of science, and that explains the structure of this book. The theme of this book is one of the most creative ideas I've seen in a long time - writing the biography of an idea (Einstein's e=mc^2) as if it were a person cruising through history. Hence the story is not about Einstein's life, or even developments in particular areas of science, but how this equation has worked its way into the public consciousness. Bodanis' coverage of each part of the equation, E, the \"equals\" sign, M, C, and \"squared\" is also a very creative concept. Unfortunately, Bodanis can't quite pull off the story without a background in hard science, so the book merely points out the gaps in his non-scientific presentation style. Bodanis quickly rushes through many scientific disciplines, sometimes in just a few paragraphs, that would require many textbooks to adequately explain. And the accuracy of many of his scientific explanations is suspect. You can see several of the other reviews here at Amazon for examples of his faulty science. I would like to add that Bodanis' descriptions of sub-atomic processes (see especially chapter 8) are suspiciously evasive and lacking on details, and show a complete lack of acknowledgement for quantum mechanics. Also, his quick description of the end of the universe (sputtering out as all energy is all used up) is only one of many viable theories on cosmology, though Bodanis does not acknowledge this, except for an extremely brief mention in the footnotes. Most annoyingly, Bodanis does a lot of stretching in this book, trying to add suspense to the history of e=mc^2 in the development of the atomic bomb, and trying to connect the equation to every single branch of science, even plate tectonics in one example. These are indirect connections at best, but the author tries to give them full significance anyway.  In fact, Bodanis can hardly get through two paragraphs without mentioning the equation. So while the unusual \"biography\" idea behind this book is highly creative and original, the results just don't add up."

It gives an interesting, logical, background of the history behind this famous equation. Amusing anecdotes give the book some humor and relevence.

This book is surprisingly well written and accessible to the reader and never makes him or her feel stupid.

The problem is that the section about Chandrasekar makes it sound like he was the first to conceptualize black holes, which he certainly wasn't -- Newton considered the possibility and Einstein was initially surprised and doubtful when it was pointed out to him by Schwarzschild  that his field equations led to the inevitable conclusion of black holes.  What Chandrasekar did on his voyage to England, which was no small feat was to prove mathematically the largest white dwarf that could resist becoming a black hole (the 'Chandrasekar limit' which is about 1.4 solar masses).  This error in the book sort of poisons the well and makes me wonder what other historical 'facts' were not quite."

Einstein knew this, although he had trouble proving it (see Einstein's Miraculous Year). By repeatedly and incorrectly stating that only nuclear/subatomic energy has a mass equivalence, Bodanis misses the great universality and majesty of Einstein's equation. He should have shown his book to a physicist before sending it to the publisher. As for me, I'll stick to reading science books written by scientists."

The story describes how these terms came together in a single equation and how the equation has affected human events.  Through it all, the reader gains an understanding of the people involved--their successes, betrayals, and beheadings.  Who knew that 'spin doctors' were practicing their craft as early as the 1600s?  It is a great and very human story."

                "Text": "Unbeknownst to their authors, almost all books on 'physics for the layperson'are maddeningly frustrating for the average reader.  That's because they all, without exception, restate certain fundamental physics concepts without really explaining them in detail. (The authors would probably counter-argue that that is the nature of our quantum world, right? Gaps without explanation.) But nevertheless, those of us who are unschooled in these matters need step-by-baby-step instructions.  Bodanis' book commits the same error with respect to electricity and magnetism (a disembodied wire of some sort goes 'round a setup magnet, somehow suggesting a field; then the wire gets connected to a 'battery' of some sort- what kind I don't know, is it the potato of my elementary school yore, or what,--anyway, and voila! the field,--again, whatever that is--is proven. But wait a minute, I thought a battery, if not the potato variety, WAS an advanced electrical device already?) If you don't know what electricity or magnetism is, as I don't, this description of Farady's experiment is truly baffling. Additionally, Bodanis does what all other physics writers do in describing the effects of lightspeed, and that is to state the following:  at once objects gain mass and look bigger, but appear foreshortened, smaller, and slower.  BUT WHY AND HOW CAN THEY APPEAR BOTH??  He simply states these two contradictory effects in adjoining paragraphs without explanation.  But the saving grace of this book is, indeed, its explanation of c squared.  Again, it may surprise the experts that the uninitiated have wondered for years why, if nothing can go faster than the speed of light, there's that c squared in the equation - if nothing indeed can go faster than c, how in the world (or outside it even) can something go c squared??  Conventional explanation of c squared--that it's a \"really big number\" and that it's \"just a conversion factor\" have been heretofore singularly unsatisfactory. Bodanis finally explains it, and for that I am grateful.  The description of the heavy water factory in Norway and its destruction are fascinating as well, in addition to anecdotes about Einstein that I hadn't heard before.  Herr Bodanis indeed.  Herr PROFESSOR Bodanis - thanks for writing this book."

Beautifully written by David Bodanis the book provides very good scientific understanding to the educated layman but also presents in a way that makes it difficult to put down.  The chapter on the microsecond by microsecond events when the first atomic bomb were dropped are truly frightening.  The chapter on Lise Meitner and her nephew on holiday in Sweeden discovering nuclear fission was a true detective story.  The final chapter (Where are they now) gave some happy and sad stories to the many characters of the book.  Some who did so much but may not have received credit due to their unconventional education (Faraday), gender (Payne, Meitner) or skin color (Chandrasekhar) begin to get their deserved credit.  Finally, the man at the center of it all who unwillingly became a popular icon spent much of his later years trying to live up to his earlier scientific fame from the special and general theories of relativity.  The book has so much more in it but I believe I will need to read it again as it contains so much!"

It offers a unique view of Einstein, but more importantly, as the title infers, discusses the equation and the role of general and special relativity in today's society. The text is not by any means laden with mathematics so it should be generally available to all.  Avoiding the complications of thick mathematics, Bodanis does an excellent job of clarifying the significance of Einstein's perception of energy and mass and, importantly, denotes the role of Newtonian thought and clearly presents other significant post-Newton, pre-Einstein age thinkers and their role. I, personally, found the discussion of special relativity and the lack of elaboration on space-time as it relates to E=mc2 a bit lacking, but still very good reading. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in better understanding concepts such as atoms, nuclear power, nuclear weaponary, Star Trek and speed of light travel,  etc."

I understood that mass could be converted to energy and that this is the fundamental equation behind the atomic bomb, but I must admit that I had never really thought beyond that. Like for instance, what in world does the speed of light have to do with the relationship between mass and energy? And what part of mass actually disappears to become energy? The book didn't answer these questions to my satisfaction but did get me thinking. (Hopefully, one of the eight physics books I found at the library will enlighten me further). Bodanis does a good job putting Einstein's equation into context. I loved learning about Faraday, Lavoisier, and others. I remember the names from school but they are so much more interesting here than in textbooks. Hopefully, more science texts and teachers can implement the engaging style of Bodanis and other such science writers."

I started out mainly wanting to know what the speed of light has to do with anything, and Bodanis takes us back to the beginning, describing not only the relevance of the speed of light, but also the earliest discoveries involving energy, the equals sign, and mass. Bodanis's writing style is very easy and engaging. If I have one complaint, it's that I would have preferred a chronological treatment of energy, mass, and the speed of light, not a treatment in that order. Still, the book is completely understandable and is chockfull of fascinating history, such as the importance of Emilie du Chatelet, Voltaire, and Lise Meitner. It's probably also the best brief history of the Manhattan Project. At a little over 200 pages, this book is a quick read, but the reader comes away with lots of historical and scientific knowledge. I'm definitely going to have to read more David Bodanis publications!"

                "Text": "Starting with each of the letters and symbols in the famous equation, the author tracks down the origin of each. Having explained those them, he charts the path of individuals and breakthroughs that led the the first atomic bombs. while that latter part is a little hard to read, knowing the tragedy and death that will follow the development of the bomb, overall this is an enjoyable and informative read. It provided the clearest explanation of the atomic chain reaction that creates the mushroom cloud I've ever read. It's so good, I had to share it with others. \"Hey, do you know...\" Perhaps other reviewers are correct in saying that it's too simplistic and too interested in flouting authority and supporting the underdog (and women). But this book will create interest that could grow beyond this introduction. In that way, it is completely worth your time."

This was a unique approach to the idea, and I felt like it worked pretty well. It introduces the scientific advances that lead up to the equation, followed by where mankind has taken this new found knowledge. It discusses the idea's applications in the atomic bomb, medical equipment, and the formation of the universe. The author offers good analogies and simplifies concepts so they can be easily understood. It was written on a basic level that lent itself to be easily understood by the lay audience, and so it probably isn't as accurate as a Ph.D. dissertation would be, but it was a good introduction to the idea and the history behind it."

And it doesn't stop there, because like any biography, it follows the equation from its inception to the various paths it has taken throughout its life, including its use in the atomic bomb, as an answer to how the sun shines, and as a way at looking at the structure of the universe. Best of all, it is not bogged down in the nitty-gritty of science -- no math degree is required to follow the story. Very entertaining and thought-provoking"

What an amazing history behind an equation we've all heard about, but many don't take the time to truly understand. I teach Natural Science at a community college and I LOVE how Bodanis writes in a way that makes very complicated information accessible to all. I wish I had time to have my students read this because I think it would give them a greater appreciation for the fact that scientists are real people, with real struggles who have to work together and rely on what knowledge has come before them. I bought this copy as a gift for one of my fellow faculty members who also teaches Natural Science. I'm sure they will like it as much as I did."

Pay no attention to the detractors who complain about the lack of equations. The author has a website containing all the gory details if you care to get into them. I found the book so wonderful that I have read it 10 times and have read another book about one of its topics- the heavy water plant in Norway during WW II. Try it; you'll love it!"

I am aware that Einstein's world view was different as his view of the cosmos was much smaller. In his day technology had not developed to view the cosmos and find trillions of Galaxies. They thought many of the sparking were stars; but in reality they were whole galaxies. With that view he projected other theories about space travel that were in error. Thus, one should examine his special theory of relativity as well. Dr. Ronald Cutburth, Management of engineering science operations, Engineering Scientist."

The storytelling approach he uses to show how discoveries by different physicists contributed to E=mc2 is fabulous. His grasp of human nature and motivation is amazing. I loved his characterizations of everyone, from Voltaire to Faraday to Einstein himself. This book is captivating and compelling reading, even for those of us who never got higher than Cs in Chemistry. :)"

                "Text": "I have read many books on this subject and NONE of them conveyed the essence of the equation the way this book does. I am not a scientist, and did poorly in chemistry in school, so I really needed a book such as this one.  Bodanis' metaphors make this famous concept - that mass and energy are the different aspects of the same thing - really easy to understand.  For example, he describes the uranium atom like an overstuffed water balloon, ready to be punctured by a slow moving neutron.  Now I can finally picture how the atomic bomb worked.  Bodanis also shows how this timeless equation developed against a backdrop of human frailty - insecurity, double-dealing, backstabbing, jealousy, and even romance.  His description of an Allied nighttime raid against a Nazi-operated heavy water factory in Norway reads like a spy novel.  There were at least two surprises in this book for me: 1)  the crucial role of women in the development of proof of Einstein's equation, and 2) the academic establishment's resistence towards the equation and other aspects of the new physics.  Many of the pioneers either skipped school or did poorly in it - probably because they were too imaginative to put up with orthodoxy.  But they kept their individual, iconoclastic spirits alive, and helped found a new physics and cosmology.  At the end of the book, author Bodanis writes \"I loved writing this book.\"  And one can tell that he did.  I loved reading it as well."

Bodanis gives lay readers an appropriate level of insight about how math and science evolved through several hundred years to propel our species toward the elegant equation that changed the world. This historical journey enlivens many forgotten but critical thinkers who made it possible for a restive patent clerk to make the essential creative leap into the intellectual unknown. But this book accomplishes something else, even greater. The author's brilliant chapter describing in micro-second details the detonation of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima creates a powerful, sobering perspective of this fearsome technology and dispassionately reminds all of us of the threats looming. The author uses his beloved science to bring into searing perspective the human face of thermonuclear war. The power to manipulate the atom has the capacity for good in medicine and other human advancements, but it is also a power capable of planetary destruction. It is wise for lay readers to understand E=MC2 beyond science. Our survival is at stake."

                "Text": "Truly, do you think understanding Einstein's theories and the illusive equation E=mc2 is impossible, reserved only for the physicists and geniuses?  Stop!  With David Bodanis' book you can understand and explain E-mc2 to anyone!  Wouldn't it be great to feel the joy of understand special relativity, general relativity and all its implications.  This accessible, well-written, engrossing book does all that and more.  It welcomes you as a capable, intelligent person into the seemingly elite world of scientific knowledge.  It is fantastic to read and re-read.  As accesible as it is it would make an excellent text or reference book also.  Do not miss adding this to your collection."

                "Text": "The fame of relativity will dwindle but Einstein's equation (E = mc2) will remain for ever because it reflects deep hidden truth. It must be noticed for the historical record that this essential equation was obtained from surprisingly successful model of the structure of universe in Eugene Savov's book Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything. Savov also simply derived the principle of uncertainty in his framework, something that Einstein's relativity cannot do."

                "Text": "As a Japanese citizen, I do not want to believe that Einstein wrote to FDR many times trying to persuade him to build A-bombs by using explicit words and I do not want to believe that FRD was so stupid and impolite that he declined the proposal by such a well-known nobel-laureate physicist. We Japanese like Einstein very much, and probably Einstein liked Japan very much since he visited Japan twice, both time welcomed by heated celebrations. It is also unlikely that he hated Germany that much since many of his relatives and friends were still there. When Einstein arrived in US, he had only a few hundred English words in his vocabulary and probably was not able to write decent letters in English. It is rather well known that a Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard wrote the letter, performed all the meticulous errands, and Einstein just signed. No letter of Einstein quoted in this book has the date or the source. Also I don't want to believe Heisenberg was a bad guy just because he was an excellent scientist. Although I firmly believe in Lise Meitner's great contribution to the fission theory, I do not want to think that Otto Hahn was a bad guy who expelled her from Keiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and stole the theory from her; to Keiser Wilhelm Institute and Otto Hahn, it was much better to let her away than losing her in a gas chamber; also in the situation with Nazi governed Germany, Otto Hahn just could not mention, in his paper, her name and her nephew's name (Robert Frisch), who were known as Jews. This book is unscientifically emotional, dramatized, opinionated and biased, so is my review of this book. \"Brighter Than Athousand Suns\" by Robert Jungk was much better to understand the historical event, and I expect much to \"Heisenberg's War\" by Thomas Powers."
