                "Text": "The only other book I can compare this to is Cramer's, and this one is better suited to a first introduction into computatioal chemistry.  I have taken one graduate quantum chemistry course, and this was more than enough background for understanding this book.  This is the only text I know of (I asked my comp chem prof if he knew of any others) that walks through a Hartree Fock calculation step by step using an example.  There are some mistakes in the formulas, but they are quite minor.  All in all, I would recommend this book to anybody interested in beginning to learn about computational chemistry."
