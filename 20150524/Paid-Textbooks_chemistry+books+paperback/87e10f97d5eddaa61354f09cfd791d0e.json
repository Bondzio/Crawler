                "Text": "For anybody who is interested in doing serious materials modeling this book belongs on your book shelf. As Materials Scientists, we don't have the luxury to assume materials behavior is isotropic. This book explains how crystal symmetry (or lack thereof) brings about anisotropic material responses to applied stresses, electric fields, composition gradients, etc... I found this book easy to read and helpful when I was studying piezoelectric behavior for an exam."
