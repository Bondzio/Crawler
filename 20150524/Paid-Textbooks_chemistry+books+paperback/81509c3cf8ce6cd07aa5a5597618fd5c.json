                "Text": "I find this book probably the best textbook in materials science I ever read. Not only the authors are experts in the field of microscopy, but they also succeeded in extremely difficult task to present the complicated  science of electron microscopy in a simple (but not oversimplified!)  language. The book covers all major aspects of transmission electron  microscopy, and contains excellent illustrations. This book is certainly a  priceless asset for students. It is recommended as one of the  best books at the beginning and intermediate level. If you are looking for  a book to learn TEM, get this one, you will never regret!"

                "Text": "This 4-volume set of paperback books provides a thorough and readable introduction to the science and practice of TEM (transmission electron microscopy).  The text is divided into short, digestable sections, each accompanied by figures, graphs and plots.  The equations are numerous, but well explained and presented with minimal derivations but full explanations.  The books are divided into concise sections making it easy for the reader to find what he/she needs.  Overall, a perfect textbook to learn about TEM, and as a reference for those more experienced in this field."

                "Text": "There are a number of books on TEM, and many are good.  However, this book provides a fresh angle for someone learning the subject for the first time because it focuses on what you need to know in order to carry out experiments.  Obviously, there is a lot of theory about lenses and scattering.  However, there are also dozens of \"factoids\" such as common lens settings, and most the frequent errors in field emission guns -- and how to handle those errors.  My mixing the practical day to day technician's data with the more theoretical underpinning which is my wont, I found it got me up to speed and functional is a very short time.  Now experieience with TEMs can carry me the rest of the way."

However, it is no doubt this set is the best and most comprehensive TEM reference book up to date."

The occasional colour images and a modernized language really do help. Also make sure to get the paperback edition, which is conveniently divided into four books."
