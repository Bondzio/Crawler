                "Text": "If the purpose of this handbook is to provide some review of various mathematical concepts of varying complexity and to demonstrate their usefulness in a variety of contexts in the physical sciences and engineering--this book provides an enlightening answer.  If on the other hand, it is intended to provide a tutorial to students in these disciplines who may have failed to comprehend some ancillary mathematical tools, or if it is intended as a reference for practicing professionals who need to refresh on a particular technique, I believe this text may be less satisfactory.  It certainly isn't a comprehensive handbook of mathematical methods like the old Soviet Mir Press handbooks, nor is it a Schaum's Outline with a carefully graduated solved examples and problems for further study.  It is an interesting study of a senior faculty member's career of teaching and research in using mathematics for the physical sciences.  I am however, a little baffled about the intended audience, and the problems it expects to address in the practitioner's application of mathematical methods."

                "Text": "\"Guide to Essential Math\" contains short and to the point articles on the mathematics that students of physics, chemistry and engineering will need for their studies. There are two aspects of presentation that I would like to see in any reference, one, I should be able to refresh my memory of subjects I had learned previously, even many years ago, and, two, I should be able to advance my understanding of these subjects into areas that are related to the subject. So, for example, having taken single variable Calculus classes, I should be able to relearn how to differentiate and integrate and take limits and, also, I should be able to extend my knowledge to areas of the subject (in my case L'Hopital's Rule), that I have not covered before. In both these regards this book met my expectations. As an added bonus, it would be great if I could use a condensed version of mathematics to learn entirely new subjects, such as, for me, Multivariate Calculus or Fourier Series. Although this book contains chapters on both of these subjects, I was unable to make significant headway in either one or any of the many other advanced topics covered, such as Special Functions, Vector Analysis and Partial Differential Equations. Of course, one cannot normally use a reference to learn new material, as the information presented is given in such a terse form. However, I will definitely keep this book in my library; I feel, as I learn new aspects of mathematics, that I will come to benefit from having a quality reference to advanced mathematics by my side."

                "Text": "I'm a software engineering student and also a math tutor.  I've been tutoring math 20+ hours a week at a community college for the last year and a half.  I tutor everything from basic mathematics through Calc II, and obviously I am taking a lot of math and logic classes myself.  As a student of math, who is fairly good at it, I think this book is awesome.  It is exactly the type of reference I need.  It cuts right to the case and gives you the formulas without a lot of long winded explanations.  The format allows for the book to contain a lot of information in a small amount of space, which makes it a great reference manual to throw in your bag.  It is not, however, a complete reference.  It should be considered a supplement.  There are very few examples and no practice problems.  I don't necessarily consider this a fault.  There are plenty of books out there that are nothing but practice problems with solutions.  In conjunction with a book of practice problems this is a perfect resource.  That is how I feel as a math student who both enjoys math and is good at it.  As a math tutor, my opinion is a little different.  This is definitely not the book to help a struggling math student.  The same brevity that makes it perfect for an engineering student is what makes it an awful reference for someone who had difficulty in the subject.  There just isn't enough \"there\" there for such student.  The good news is there are lots and lots of bulky detailed references available for those students, though."

It does so in a well-done user-friendly compact style which is great for being very organized, rational, sharp and clear. The font-types, expanations, notations and graphics are very well-chosen for a full guide to esential math for physics, chemistry and  engineering students. There is good coverage of these topics making for a little reference manual, easier to use than many, due to the compact clarity and good order of topics and equations. The fine style is done without frills such as color graphics, many side-topics and theory or any practice problems. This keeps the size and cost of this little guide down -- while still being well-done and very useful +++"
