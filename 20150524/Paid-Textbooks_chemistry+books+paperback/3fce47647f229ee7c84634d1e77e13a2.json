                "Text": "It's the book to have if you want to learn computer simulation. It covers both Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics, from the start for the beginner. It also includes more advanced topics, but is definitely focused on  studying fluids and not solids. The code is written in Fortran. If you  program in C I suggest Rapaport's book, but this one is a definite must  read."
