                "Text": "A very good introductionary book for students or engineers. Considers main classical conspects of ion transport, thermodynamics and conductivity. I've found a number of concepts in the contemporary papers and books that would be derived from the basics, described by the book. It would also be helpful for scientists/engineers who are not in the chemistry physics or chemistry. Requires basics of calculus. And yeah, much much less than $$$ XXXX pages useless \"all-included\" type of handbooks). The only disadvantage is that the bibliography can be extended according to the modern needs."
