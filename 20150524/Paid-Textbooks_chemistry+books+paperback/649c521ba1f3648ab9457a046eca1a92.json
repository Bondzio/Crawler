The text is not overly mathematical in its  presentation, setting it apart from the numerous other texts available on  this subject.  After having read this text, a student is amply able to  understand discussions of group theory with respect to spectroscopy or  otherwise."

This book is a bit badly laid out, doesn't explain things very well and is pretty much useless unless you already have at least a simple grasp of Group Theory.  I don't know what awful libraries you lot in Cleveland have but this is certainly not a particularly good book."
