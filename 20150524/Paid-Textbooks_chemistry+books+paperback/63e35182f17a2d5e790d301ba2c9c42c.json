                "Text": "Boys book is about 100 years old and is flat out the best first book on bubbles.  It takes you through a lot of interesting experiments that Boys did into areas that are very remote from soap and bubbles.  Full of \"oh, wows\", it is a book that I reread about once a year (I do bubbles professionally, and every rereading contains new insights for me)."
