                "Text": "I bought the 1975 first addition as a graduate student.  This classic text imparts to the reader a good basic understanding of electron stimulated x-ray generation as well as x-ray absorption.  The role of x-ray absorption edges, and the associated use of the jump ratio in x-ray absorption is also explained well.  The book also has a number of useful tables, plots, and diagrams to aid the reader."
