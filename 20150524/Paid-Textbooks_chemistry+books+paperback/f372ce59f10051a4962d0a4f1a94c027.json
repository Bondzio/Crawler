                "Text": "Widom does a fantastic job at articulating both the impact of statistical thinking on the real world and the complexities of mathematics required to infer knowledge about chemical systems. This book has everything a chemist needs to know about statistical mechanics, without watering down the subject. I read this book four years after taking a formal statistical mechanics course, and I understand it better now than I did in the course! I wish this book was provided as a supplement to my formal course work."
