The only minor drawback is the intense focus on the many kinds of sub-atomic particles (Hadrons, Fermions, Leptons, Pions, W particles, etc.), but I really liked the way the information was presented. A good book for the non-scientist. Makes the completely complicated quantum theory quasi-understandable, if not fathomable. I think it was Neils Bohr you said that something like \"anybody who claims to understand quantum mechanics really doesn't\", as it is weird science based on probabilities. Not many equations in the book; a few in the footnotes."

It makes very few assumptions about the reader's background -- but from a practical perspective, a reader with some appreciation for basic physics will get more from the book.  What amazes me is just how much territory the author covers, using a very informal and approachable style.  It's thoughtful exposition, not just a perfunctory review of the facts.  In my opinion this is one of the best \"introductory\" books on quantum physics."

                "Text": "I liked this book. I'm on my third re-read. Not because it's poorly written, on the contrary it's very well written. It's because this is a very abstract science, and asks one to really stretch your imagination to the limits. The author does a good job of illustrating several points. He does sort of get ahead of himself rather rapidly, especially when it comes to listing particles, their properties which he does rapidly left and right. He should spend more time on spin properties, a bit more nuts and bolts with quarks in my opinion. These parts are why I'm re-reading it. I pick up something new each time I do however and I don't fault the author for this either. I dont' consider myself brilliant but I do like this science so maybe if my IQ were higher I might have \"picked it all up\" on the first pass? Anyway it doesn't contain lots of nice diagrams, the ones that are in the book look like someone scrawled them on the face of a napkin. But still it gets the point across. If you want a book with nice pretty graphs, tons of formulas and math then don't buy this. As the title says in the last few words \"for Everyone.\" Those two words automatically remove lots of math from the contents. Most folks I know have trouble with math if they don't have their cell phones handy. I learned a great deal more than I knew before about this science from this book. I certainly learned more from it than listening to Pamela Gay on Astronomy Cast complain that this science \"hurts her head.\"  It's a good book. It has lots of pictures of important physicist, Enrico Fermi, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, etc. I like to put a face with the names. One review said this book is \"NOT\" an easy way into this science. There is no \"easy\" way into this realm. It confounds the best minds at times. This is a subject that is difficult to understand by the human mind so it goes with explaining it to layfolk as well. I suggest just jumping into this if you are interested in the quantum world. This book is about as easy as it gets, you might not think so after reading it, but the author does a good job of explaining most of it. If you are like me you'll want to read other opinions and facts on quantum mechanics. This book is a good starting place in my opinion."

Now, I don't feel disappointed strictly speaking, but I find claims such as: \"A TOP, A MUST!\" a bit of overstatements. Mr. Ford was accurate in describing the basics of the Standard Model in the quantum framework, and some of his translations of quantum ideas in the common sense world are nice and useful but, in the average, nohow his work hovers above a host of similar books devoted to the same subject. So, read it if you are interested in quantum physics and all that, and you have some previous knowledge of the topic (otherwise, if you are a real layman, you risk to get lost in the first 20 pages or so); it is fair but, at least in my opinion (I am a professional astrophysicist, and a popularizer in Italian language), just fair."

In terms of the reader's assumed knowledge, this book doesn't aim for the *lowest* common denominator. Some familiarity with first-year algebra is helpful, but not essential; the concepts generally stand on their own without any mathematics at all. Ford also explains the experiments that led to many aspects of the standard model, particularly from earlier developments. This helps the reader appreciate the evidence physicists were weighing in their attempts to piece together the puzzle. If anything, I would have appreciated more details on these experiments. But, for a quick introduction to the topic, this book does a fine job balancing the information and does an exceptional job getting the reader to visualize concepts."

It may not cover a lot of more subtle issues but it's a good first read I think.  The appendix helps to order the particles in your mind.  I keep getting terms mixed up like bosons & fermions.  It's really just a matter of familiarity and memory refresh."
