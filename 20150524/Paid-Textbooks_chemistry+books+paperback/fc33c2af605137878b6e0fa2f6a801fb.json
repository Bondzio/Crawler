                "Text": "Mr. Weeks is an excellent writer, combining enough theory with gobs of practice problems. The student of organic chemistry will come away with a clearer understanding of reaction mechanisms by an understanding of pushing electrons that his book provides. I highly recommend this book if you want to learn how the flow of electrons in a reaction leads from reactants-to-products. Well done, Mr. Weeks!"
