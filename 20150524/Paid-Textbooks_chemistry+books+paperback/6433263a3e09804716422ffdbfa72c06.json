Too bad it's getting outdated and they never upgraded it.  Still, it's the best method I've ever used, and I've been teaching English since the beginning of the 80s."

I've used other books, all of which were disappointing in one way or another. This book engages adult students and does not insult them with kiddie stuff. The workbook has an appropriate balance of listening, speaking, and writing. The voices on the tape are natural and give the students good listening experience."
