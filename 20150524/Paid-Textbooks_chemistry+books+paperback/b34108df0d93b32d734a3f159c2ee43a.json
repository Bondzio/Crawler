                "Text": "In this book author focused on very important \u201cdriving forces\u201d \u2013 on the hydrophobic interaction, or on role of the solvent-induced interaction in conformation of macromolecule. This book is addressed to the physicists, who have an interest to the structural biology. It contains a lot of concepts of protein folding, but author with ease and grace shows how using simple models and having a strict statistical physical approach, it is possible to explain such a complicated process as protein folding. I, as a teacher of \"Statistical Physics of Macromolecules\", using the material in this book, significantly upgraded my lectures that benefited students. Moreover, using some of the concepts in this book I am developing the idea that hydrophilic, rather hydrophobic interactions are more important in biological processes such as protein folding"
