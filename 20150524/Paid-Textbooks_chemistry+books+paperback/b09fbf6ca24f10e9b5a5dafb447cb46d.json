                "Text": "I was looking for an introduction and practical guide the fluorescence microscopy, and this is definitely it.  My only qualm is that the introductory chapters are physics heavy.  As a biologist, I do have a working knowledge of basic physics, but some of it was cumbersome.  Again, this is not necessarily a negative thing, as I will most likely use it as a reference in the future, it was just a bit much for my current needs."
