                "Text": "This book has good content, particularly for ophthalmic optics. The description of optical aberrations is useful. However, the treatment of paraxial optics is confusing. The authors should avoid the use of symbols  that are not writeable (e.g. Cyrillic), and obscure Greek letters. All in  all, a useful book."
