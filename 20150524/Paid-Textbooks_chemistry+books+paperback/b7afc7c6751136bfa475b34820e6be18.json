                "Text": "I found this book to be a great introduction to statistical mechanics.  The thermodynamic chapters (which are mostly at the very beginning and very end of the book) left a lot to be desired.  The authors did, however, relate stat mech ideas back to thermo topics, which helped motivate the subject.  Finally, I would not recommend this book to be used as a self-study book.  I read the chapters before the lectures and found that I repeatedly needed the lecture information (i.e. info not in the book) in order to the do the homework problems."
