                "Text": "I went two years between General Chemistry and Inorganic Chemistry. This was reccomended to me as a review tool by my teacher and I can't say anything bad about this book. It was perfect for me: a seasoned undergraduate who needed a refresher on atomic orbitals, lewis structures, MO theory and the like. The book is very well written; not a word is wasted. The explanations are clear, concise and engaging. It may be in black and white but the diagrams and illustrations are also extremely helpful. This primer was a great reference for me throughout the semester. It's accessible enough for anyone but as the title of my review suggests, I think it works best for someone who is rusty on General Cehmistry and needs a high quality, low-price, easy-to-carry review tool, and this book fits that perfectly. Highly reccomended!"
