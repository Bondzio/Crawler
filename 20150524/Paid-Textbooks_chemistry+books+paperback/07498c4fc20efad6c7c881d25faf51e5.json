                "Text": "A great accompanyment to a high school chemistry course.  High school chemistry is so abstract, that one wonders how chemists ever thought to look at the things they studied to develop the field.  Asimov explains what concrete problems and concerns led to the development of each important discovery, situating it in terms of what was understood at the time, and making the logic of the field's development clear.  Easy enough for the non-scientist, but with lots of material I never learned in my science education.  Asimov was a great popularizer!"

                "Text": "I've had my copy of this since high school. Most of my other books are gone, but I still have this one. It's a very excellent overview of the developments in chemistry, from the early days of discovery, from Lavoisier, to Mendleev, to the Atomic Age. A wonderful book that livens up what can be a very dry subject."

                "Text": "This little paperback, published in 1965 by Dr. Asimov is a highly-readable and interesting introduction to the history of chemistry.  It begins in ancient times with the Egyptians and Greek philosophers. I was pleased that adequate attention was given to the brilliant Arabic scientists and their insurmountable contribution to early modern (post-middle age) science and medicine.  The book does an excellent job with the major discoveries of the 19th century.  It describes the chemists, their experiments and major discoveries in detail that is satisfactory to both laymen and scientists alike. While the 20th century has given rise to substantial developments in chemical theory, particularly in organic and biochemistry, this text still stands as being a great introduction which will be entertaining to the reader unlike most modern textbooks. 5 Stars and Highly Recommended!"

                "Text": "This is the best, most clear, well-organized, readable intro to the history of Chemistry I've seen.  I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars because I do think there's room for an even better intro (explains the concepts a tad better?  a bit more entertaining to read?), but if you're looking for an introduction to the topic I'd recommend this hands down.  A much better intro than Levere."
