                "Text": "I enjoyed reading and studying this \"thermodynamic/kinetics with a biochemistry twist\".  Most thermo books get too bogged down with ideal gases and the cost in time versus the benefits of material learned is too great.  Dr. Hammes however has an easy reading style and focuses in on the \"meat\" of physical biochemistry pertaining to thermodynamics and kinetics.  I am not a formal student, but a cardiologist interested in physical biochemistry.  P-Chem learning requires doing the problems.  The only drawback to Professor Hammes's textbook is that there are no solved problems or solutions manual for the problems in the back of each chapter.  Nerds like me find these problems as a useful exercise in learning to insure that we have mastered the material.  You will not be disappointed in this book."
