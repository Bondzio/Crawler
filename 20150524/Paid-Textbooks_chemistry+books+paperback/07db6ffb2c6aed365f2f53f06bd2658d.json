                "Text": "My need for learning about the use of NMR in determining structure in biomolecules was the main driver for me choosing this work. It turned out to be a good desk reference and a fine introduction. There is a good link between recent primary literature and this illuminating text which clarified a number of the basics which clearly improved my understanding of the primary literature and therefore this was a very useful text book."
