After looking high and low, I must recommend this text to everyone who want an explanation detail by detail.  The concepts are handled quite nicely so that anyone with basic physics and chemistry understanding will comprehend.  Also, there are plenty of examples of compounds which makes analysis easier to identify different bonds and vibration modes.  Keep this handy with you and treasure it forever.  This one is a keeper."
