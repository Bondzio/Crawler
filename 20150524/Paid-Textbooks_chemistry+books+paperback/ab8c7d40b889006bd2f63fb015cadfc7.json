Already a bit on the dry academic side and then translated from French to English, it can occassionally be a difficult read, but the unique nature of the subject makes sure it says a fascinating read.  The book is broken up into sections each a few pages long asking if and why a preconceived notion regarding food is true (Does the juices of meat really contract to the center when you cook it?, Does it matter if you slowly heat your stock or use hot water from the beginning?), the nature of flavor (how salt affects sweet and bitter flavors), just what goes on with the food before we eat it (What causes cheeses to taste the way they do tracing it all the way back to the diet of the cow), and theoretical ideas to make the culinary field better (Developing new cooking techniques involving technology such as artificial vacuums and electrical fields).  While the book uses specific examples, it's easy to take This's basic technique and apply it to anything food related, which you could imagine is his goal, having founded the field sharing its name with the book."

This book is intended to explain the science of food to people who are not scientists, but it fails to put things sufficiently in laymen (or even in chef) terms."

                "Text": "This is not a cook book, it's a food science book - and it's not about Molecular Gastronomy in the Ferran Adria sense (high-concept innovative art-food), it's more along the lines of Alton Brown, explaining why certain common cooking techniques work, or why not, through experimentation - though in a much more formal/academic - and palpably French - style. Good, interesting reading - my one big complaint is that the writing is uneven - while he might go into minute detail to explain the chemical reactions underpinning one cooking technique, in the next chapter he quickly glosses over important information, or forgets to answer questions posed earlier in a chapter. Often he'll describe the results of experiments and not give his methodology, or vice versa. One nice thing is that chapters are short, so it's an easy book for reading a quick bit here and there."

I would recommend Potter's Cooking for Geeks or anything from America's Test Kitchen.  Don't look here for many molecular gastronomy tips that will use chemicals or liquid nitrogen in the kitchen, this deals more with the science behind food and how humans interact with it.  You will find a lack of recipes here as well."

I have to admit after reading the first few chapters and finding it not to be what I hoped for I just browsed the rest.  I'll probably read it through at a later date.  The author clearly has a in-depth understanding of what science is about and how the it works (as opposed to pseudo-science) and a deep knowledge of cooking, eating, and enjoying food.  If the title was a bit different I'd probably rate it higher, but I think it misleads about what the book is actually about.  Other reviews found this too \"French\", but I think the ideas presented on the whole transcend any nationality."

Since the author was a chemist, I was expecting a clearly stated hypothesis and conclusion in each chapter.  Instead, each chapter read like a movie review.  (Where at the end, you still don't know if the movie was good or bad).  It was deep on explanations, but short on clear conclusions to the hypothesis proposed.  I am well educated with a technical background, and still found the reading a little challenging."
