                "Text": "Denn's book is an excellent introductory text for chemical engineering fluid mechanics.  The book starts off with the basics of dim-analysis and proceeds into macro and then micro problems.  This is a very logical  ordering and allows the student to see the subject from a broader  perspective instead of getting bogged down in the systematics of the  problems themselves.  A careful reading is definitely needed to get the  most out of the book, though.  And the section on turbulence is a bit  unclear.  Overall, though, a good book to keep for many years to come as a  chem eng."

This textbook is used at leading institutions such as UC Berkeley, MIT, Princeton, & Cornell.  Using BSL as a reference for fully worked out examples and problems, Denn's textbook covers essential material for graduate school and industrial research."
