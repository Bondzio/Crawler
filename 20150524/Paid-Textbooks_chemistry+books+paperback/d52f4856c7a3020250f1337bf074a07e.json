                "Text": "Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics remain a mystery to most people, even many of those who have some background in science. In this book Professor Ben-Naim continues his challenge to the orthodoxy, presenting the range of interpretations of entropy, and developing a case for a method based on information theory. The ideas of order and disorder are examined, and the question of what can and cannot be quantified. The work is not so technical as his earlier \"A Farewell to Entropy\", but an undergraduate level of knowledge of ideal gas theory, probability, and calculus is presumed. However the development is usually accompanied with detail to assist the reader. The book is presented as an exploration of ideas, noting fallacies in some, and advantages in others. The presentation is clear, and there are many helpful examples to consider. I would recommend this book to any student who is curious about one of the most mysterious concepts in physics."

                "Text": "This book is Dedicated on its initial page and then Preface to a rebuke of \"an anonymous reviewer\" whose critique of his journal article and his book on the best way to explain Entropy the author didn't like.  Unfortunately, it continues as a screed against that reviewer and all others who disagree with his approach, with snarky asides throughout that get really, really tiring.  I find it odd that no reviewer here to date other than Braithwaite mentions this off-putting weakness in presenting otherwise useful perspectives.  About a quarter way through, you want to scream \"Just Get Over It!\" and throw the book away (I almost did), but if you can tolerate the pissing-contest remarks and make it past that point, he winds down the language on how stupid everyone is who disagrees with him, and his interpretations on Entropy are worthwhile food for thought, whether you agree with him or feel they are conclusive or not."

One of my targets was revisting the laws of thermodynamics.  Professor Ben-Naim's book did not disappoint!  I was intriqued with the connection of entropy to probability and uncertainty.  This book is well written and a thorough explanation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the entropy of closed systems.  I highly recommend reading this book, it was entertaining as well as enlightening.  I totally enjoyed the histories and references.  Great value and I purchased and read more of his books with more to follow."
