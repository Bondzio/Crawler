                "Text": "Herve This shares some of his vast knowledge about the science involved in everyday cooking.  The book is organized more as a series of essays about particular topics rather than one cohesive work which threw me off at first but allows the book to be read in short bursts, which is sometimes all you can handle of the more technical passages.  As someone deeply interested in food science it was fascinating but if you don't want to delve into the molecular reactions that occur when an emulsion is created it may not be the book for you.  Still, some of the passages (particularly the one about wine) would be interesting to anyone.  Highly recommended if you are interested in food science or molecular gastronomy."

The chemical art of cooking s considered in a survey of common culinary techniques and practices, examining food's molecular components and considering how flavors are created and how the properties of liquids, oils and fats play into basic culinary practices. Culinary libraries strong in science will find this a winner."
