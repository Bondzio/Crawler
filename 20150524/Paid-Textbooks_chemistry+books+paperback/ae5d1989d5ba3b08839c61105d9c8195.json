                "Text": "A valuable refernce for any organic chemist in the early years of a career in industry or as a graduate student. Aviods being bogged down in quantum theory and explains NMR in a clear concise manner. I have read the first 1/3 and couldn't be more pleased. I would also recommend Andrew Derome as well."
