                "Text": "having a B.S. in chemistry and now finishing a M.S. in chemistry, solutions manuals are always helpful when you are doing your homework and can't quite get to the answer on your own.  this solutions manual is slightly less \"clear\" on the work to get to the answer but nonetheless has 85-90% of the work on the paper for you to follow.  being quantum chemistry, it's a must buy because you're never going to know everything but with this you can try to better understand it."

It actually leads you through most of the problems so that if you accidentally make a simple error, then you can easily find out what you did wrong.  However, some of the problems from the book are ridiculous to begin with, so the solutions manual isn't necessarily helpful for them.  The manual is in good quality."

Enough support is provided that with a little effort the problem can be figured out. This allows you to get the correct answers and still learn the content."
