                "Text": "I discovered this book because it was referenced in a summary of the topic in Scientific American. I think the subject is important and fascinating. But after reading a few pages of the book, I decided regretfully that, as usual, before you can undertstand the latest scientific advances in any detail you have to master whole fields of science -- in this instance, optics and quantum physics. It's not the author's fault. He writes well, but there's no way to simplify the underlying prerequisites. (The annotated pictures in the Scientific American article did help to gain some notion of what's going on.)"
