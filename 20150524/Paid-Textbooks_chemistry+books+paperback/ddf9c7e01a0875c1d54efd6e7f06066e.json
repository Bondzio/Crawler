                "Text": "Overall, this book is decent for a graduate level radiochemistry class.  It has a lot of problems, although some of the answers seem to be at odds with those that we and our instructor got.  I have used this for a reference book in addition to the Freidlander book, but this one is perhaps a bit easier to read and understand.  There are lots of tabels and figures reproduced in this book, so this book is quite helpful if you're wanting to calculate the probability of certain processes (e.g. what will happen if my gamma ray of a certain energy interacts with matter)."
