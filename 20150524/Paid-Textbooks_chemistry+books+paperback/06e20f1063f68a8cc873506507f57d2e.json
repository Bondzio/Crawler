                "Text": "The book does a good job of introducing the concepts; good explanations and proper coverage of all material.  However, some equations in this book are incorrect (mild typos) and answers provided in the back cannot be depended on (we can even figure out, sometimes, what the person writing the solution did wrong).  Still, our teacher did enjoy giving us these problems to see if we'd notice."

                "Text": "We use this book in our masters course of soft matter physics. The strength is that it is the only book I know that covers so many aspects of soft matter physics. However, many of the derivations are quite unclear and hard to follow in my opinion. I usually have to spend a lot of time actually figuring out what the author means and do calculations by myself. There are also some typos etc. but I know this is hard to avoid entirely (I wrote a book myself so I know). It would be nice to see an improved new release of this book in the future."
