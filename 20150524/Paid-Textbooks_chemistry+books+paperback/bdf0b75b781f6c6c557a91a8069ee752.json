                "Text": "Unlike Parr and Yang's Density-Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules, this book doesn't have many rigorous while lengthy derivations. However, it gives readers a clear clue for DFT ,and most importantly, a way to appreciate this theory as a chemist. I think this book is a perfect complement for Parr and Yang's book."
