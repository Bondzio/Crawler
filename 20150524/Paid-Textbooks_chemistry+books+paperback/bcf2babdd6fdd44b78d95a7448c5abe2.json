                "Text": "This is a great supplementary book for an introductory-level college chemistry course. It explains major concepts and theories in full detail, but refrains from the intense mathematical derivations of some functions that aren't required for a general chemistry course. Gray uses a common-sense approach in tackling complex functions, visually showing their physical counterparts (such as orbitals in the case of the Schrodinger Equation) rather than relying solely on equations."
