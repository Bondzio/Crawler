The author's remarks on \"abuse\" of methods (such as the Langevin technique) are well  worth understanding, even if one does not agree with him in all cases. The  price is a bit steep which is unfortunate since this book is really ideal  for advanced undergraduates and graduate students."

As noted by previous reviewers, van Kampen does a particularly good job of spelling out the necessary conditions for using Langevin techniques.  My only complaint: some of the derivations are fast-and-loose, with typos that lead to confusion."
