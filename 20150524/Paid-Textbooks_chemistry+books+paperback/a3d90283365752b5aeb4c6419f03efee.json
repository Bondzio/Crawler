                "Text": "This collection of numerous problems in both old atomic theory as well as (slightly) more modern theory is a great review to students who may have taken introductory QM classes and need a refresher, or as a supplement to  those students currently learning QM.  The topics covered are varied and  problems include complete solutions.  Overall a good volume to include in  any early theorist's collection."
