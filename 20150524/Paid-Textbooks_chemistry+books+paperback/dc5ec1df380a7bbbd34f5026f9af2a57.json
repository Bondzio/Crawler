                "Text": "Professional opticians probably already know about this classic work by Twyman (of Twyman-Green interferometer fame), and those who don't certainly ought to pick up a copy. However, the book holds particular interest for the 'amateur telescope maker', who still works glass with simple equipment, and can benefit from knowing about traditional optical workshop techniques."

The book is thorough, easy to read, well illustrated and even today, worth owning."
