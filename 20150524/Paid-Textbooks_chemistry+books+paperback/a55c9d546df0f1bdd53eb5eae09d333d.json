                "Text": "This book is one of the best introduction in crystal structure analysis  that I have ever seen! Due to it's limited size (and price !!) it covers  the most important topics of x-ray structure analysis in an easy  understandable language without boring the reader with mathematical  details. You really get a good impression about what the basic principles  and problems of x-crystallography are, and how the can be solved. Everybody  wanting to start with x-ray structure analysis should read this book at the  very beginning."

It consists of only one page, and it has thousands of laughable omissions. I can't believe Dr. Clegg (and associates) allowed this book to be published with such a terrible, terrible index. This is a text book, kids. It needs a thorough index."
