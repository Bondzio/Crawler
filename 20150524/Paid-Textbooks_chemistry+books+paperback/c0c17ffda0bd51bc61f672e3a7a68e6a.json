A new edition to eliminate typos, errors in derivations, and to provide a lttle more explanation where necessary, would render the book very useful to students and professionals alike."

                "Text": "Did you already learn something but couldn't remember the exact details of it or you just want to know the basics (very basics) then this book is for you. The princeton guide gives a quick summary of some very useful stuff. Don't try and actually learn (study) from this book because it doesn't give any problems. (Sadly, doing problems is the best way to learn it)! For someone like me who has seen almost everything in physics, this book is perfect for reacquainting me with some long time facts and calculations that I have forgotten. The key word FORGOTTEN, not actually trying to learn from because I have already done so.  Summarize: Undergrads in the early stage don't buy this book! For upperUndergrads who are thinking about going on to grad school or actual other grad students, do buy this book!"

                "Text": "As we say in my country, \"a hurried one eats raw\". Many many mistakes are made in this book. It is a good project of a book, and the star is for this, but I've got a strong doubt that it is good for a student, specially if used as a guide. So many mistakes that I laughed at some of them. Princeton University, well recognised all around the world, should think twice before putting its name on a book."
