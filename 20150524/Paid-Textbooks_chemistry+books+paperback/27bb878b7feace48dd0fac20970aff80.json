                "Text": "This book puts the radiation health risk of nuclear power in perspective. It points out that the the risks of climate change from fosil fuel burning out weigh the potential  health risks associated with nuclear power. This is a sorely needed message in that the public thinks that nuclear power is a thousand times more dangerous than coal burning but the data shows that the oposite is in fact the reality."

No previous scientific knowledge is needed to understand text material. Authors couldn't have been more enthusiastic about writing this book. Anyone interested in science related careers or perhaps even a quick understanding of what radiation is, will find this helpful. \"Coffee\" table style book, packed with enough information. Information includes, what is radiation?, radiation history, types of radiation, should we fear or worship radiation? how radiation is used (past and tense), where radiation technology and understanding is going. Like stated above, quick mediocre \"coffee\" table kind of read. Up-to-date book, written after the Fukishima disaster. Modern applications included."

By first addressing the radiation effects of the survivors of the Hiroshima / Nagasaki atomic bombs studied in a joint USA-Japanese study still ongoing, the book shows how little were the effects and why. After further explanations based on Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, the book addresses the survivors of the Fukushima massive tsunami waves to explain ( page 132) why \u201cany impact of radiation released at Fukushima is extremely unlikely\u201d. This was confirmed upon completion on April 2, 2014 by the United Nations\u2019 study of Fukushima by their international technical group, originally formed to study the atomic bomb effects. AND THE BOOK IS READABLE !!"

While the book did appear to cover what is known, it would have benefitted greatly from shorter more numerous chapters so the reader could have a stopping point to digest the material.  I did finally learn something I wanted to know for a long time --  How long will it take for nuclear radiation to go away?  --  Plutonium needs 240,000 years to break down completely."
