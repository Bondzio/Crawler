The material is easy to follow and yet covers a huge array of critical information and analytical techniques, from correcting for anti-aliasing filters in digitisers to a whole treatise on removing instrument responses. Can't recommend this highly enough if you're getting into seismology. An essential reference book and a steal at $40 or less."
