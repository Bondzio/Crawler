                "Text": "as a graduate student with a background in physical chemistry and now working in biophysical chemistry, i found this book to be an excellent overview of photosynthesis.  blankenship clearly outlines broad topics to be covered in the first chapter then delves into well-organized detail in subsequent chapters.  this book was recommended as a reference by my advisor, but i found it so well written that i read nearly the entire book and bought a copy for my own. i'd recommend this book to anyone intersted in photosynthestic mechanisms at the molecular level (including light harvesting, water oxidation, protein structures, and carbon fixation)."

                "Text": "Very well written. It has an impressive historic review of photosynthesis. The last chapter on photosynthesis evolution is also very good. I needed to understand the mechanism of light harvesting and the function of antenna and I got the information from this book in a very concise and readable format. It is a must-have book for anybody working on photosynthesis."

                "Text": "This text presents a physics approach to the understanding of the process of photosynthesis. The basic approach is to view the chlorophyll molecule, with its many different versions, as an antenna. The author is not shy in his use of mathematical equations, even differentials and integrals, but not so much to scare away those biologists not so comfortable with them. An excellent appendix provides readers with background material in the basic physics concepts, including quantum mechanics. Through it all, the author's voice comes through loud and clear, as if he were speaking to you directly. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on the evolution of photosynthesis."

The important points are hit with enough information for the reader to descern their importance (if not directly stated). Surveying the important concepts in chemistry and physics will be required. Bob realized this need and provided a review in the appendix!"
