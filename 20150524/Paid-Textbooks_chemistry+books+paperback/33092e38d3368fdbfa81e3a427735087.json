                "Text": "Even if beginning with only an introductory understanding of quantum mechanics, this excellent book will allow you to understand most major branches of spectroscopy.  The chapters are organized to include reasonable amounts of both theory and show real spectra to help use the theory in the context of real research.  One of the earlier chapters includes a review/primer on group theory and the remaining chapters can be understood with the group theory presented in that chapter.  This book is therefore suitable as a text and is also very usefull as a reference."

The chapter on quantum mechanics is well organized, and introduces the reader into the tools necessary for understanding the logic behind molecular spectroscopy. Simple, clear and easy to follow. The way the book is organized is also very good, from general/simple to specific/complex, so it's suitable for undergraduate students and all type of scientists."
