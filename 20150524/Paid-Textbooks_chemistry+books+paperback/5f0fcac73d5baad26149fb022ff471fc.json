However, I wouldn't recommend it for someone interested in the subject and not taking a class.  I did need lectures and supplemental notes to help understand a lot of the subject matter.  Also, it doesn't give solutions to the problems in the back of the book."

Delivery date kept getting pushed back.  We ordered a second book from another vendor because we had past experience with no show books under same circumstances.  Ended up with 2 books arriving in time for school.Sold the extra to another student.  I guess 2 books are better than none."
