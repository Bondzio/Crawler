                "Text": "This biography was not written by writers, but by two people who write.  I enjoy biographies, and after reading The Double Helix i wanted to know more about Pauling, but i am a bit disappointed with this book.  The science  parts are too academic.  The final pages of the book, where the authors  discuss a psychological analysis of Pauling's personality, rather belong in  a doctoral thesis.  This is not a book for general consumption, but most  likely for someone with a good background on chemistry and molecular  biology, who from that basis wants to learn more about Pauling."
