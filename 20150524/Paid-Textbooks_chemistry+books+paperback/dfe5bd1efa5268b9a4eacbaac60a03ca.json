Very clear text with plenty of information on topics (i.e., reactor design) that often confuse students.  -Mike Walker Thorsvedtt"

It was almost impossible for us(about 5 students) to learn from this book. I ended up buying LaMarsh's \"Introduction to nuclear reactor theory\". It was the same info and much easier to understand."
