                "Text": "An excellent book to self-learn the basic principles of atomic spectroscopy such as flame AAS/AES and plasma spectroscopy (ICP/DCP/MIP). It also includes the basic instrumentation and fundamental principle of all major atomic spectroscopy techniques.  It is a must read book for  technician or junior analytical chemist to learn the very basic but  essential technical knowledge of AAS and ICP."
