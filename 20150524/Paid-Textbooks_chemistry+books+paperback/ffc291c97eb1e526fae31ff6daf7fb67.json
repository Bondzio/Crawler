Though this is an introductory textbook of geostatistics, it's theoretical approach and explanation are clear, creative, and easy to understanding for students who are new to this area. I would like to recommend this book for all of students who have an interest in geostatistics and for experts too."

                "Text": "Between 1965 and 1970 Professor Georges Matheron's most gifted disciples stripped the variance off the distance-weighted average and called what was left a kriged estimate to honor D G Krige. Infinite sets of kriged estimates and zero kriging variances are aberrations in applied statistics. Geostatistical software converted Bre-X's bogus grades and Busang's barren rock into a massive phantom gold resource. It makes no sense to dismiss Fisher's F-test. It should have been applied to the variance of the set and the first variance term of the ordered set. Geostatistical software converted Bre-X's bogus grades and Busang's barren rock into a massive phantom. It did so before Bre-X's boss salter went missing!"
