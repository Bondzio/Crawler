                "Text": "I don't know why more people don't use this book or the authors' more advanced version, \"Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry\", but I think they are both fantastic. This book in particular is very clearly written with explicit examples and and relevant end-of-chapter exercises...with detailed solutions to the odds (very rare)! It focuses more on on many-electron problems and methods, which is essential for understanding chemical problems. If your an undrgraduate chemistry major or a beginning graduate student in chemistry who needs a refresher before taking a more advanced class, you would be well served by this book."
