                "Text": "I am just starting out in spectroscopy and thought that a reference of common bright stars and their spectra would be very helpful. Something I can compare to and see if my calibrations are close. This book does that. It would do a great job if the specrta illustrations were as good as the example on the front cover. The images in the book are very poor reproductions. I am sure the author took good spectra images, it's just that in the book the spectal lines are hard to make out."
