                "Text": "My opinion of this book is fairly positive.  There are quite a few worked examples, mostly related to combustion problems.  I worked through all of them and found that I benefited from the exercises.  The examples contain more information than I've seen in most thermodynamics books.  Again, there is a big emphasis on combustion, but within that orientation the discussion is well written."
