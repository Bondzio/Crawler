                "Text": "I'm a computational chemistry major and this book is reasonably easy to read and is extremely useful. All the flowcharts, matrices and tables are extremely helpful as reference materials and will likely carry me through all the way to the end of grad school. It's very small, but very concise and makes organic chemistry, a subject which often kills with information overload, something very simple to understand, without losing any of the complexities inherent to the field. I would recommend it to anyone studying organic chemistry; it teaches a way of thinking that is often overlooked in courses teaching this subject."
