                "Text": "This book is an excellent introductory graduate level text on nonlinear dynamics for those who wish to understand the basic concepts before seeing the mathematical rigor at the heart of the subject.  Strogatz avoids getting caught up in mathematical nuances which often cloud the big picture for non-math students, and thereby clearly impresses upon the reader the essence of nonlinear dynamics, eventually building up to chaos.  The examples and problems are truly unique and inspiring.  This book is an excellent starting place for someone who knows little or nothing about nonlinear dynamics but has done some basic work with linear differential equations and linear algebra."

                "Text": "Basically, if you have a solid foundation in elementary multivariable calculus (calc III) and some aspects of ODEs, and want to know just what's going on with this new 'chaos trend,' and more importantly want to know why 'chaos' is actually useful, then read this book.  As one reviewer noted, this book is not mathematically rigorous, and there's a simple reason for this: one can't explain nonlinear phenomena rigorously with just an elementary multivariable calculus backround.  To rigorously treat the material in this book, you must have at least some point-set topological backround and have a decently strong real analysis backround (even Strogatz uses concepts from analysis and topology in an elementary way, such as compactness and measure) and even more advanced books that assume such a backround are sometimes less than rigorous (i.e. 'Perko' often says 'it can be shown' rather than showing it himself.)  However, the lack of rigor I think is a good thing.  Strogatz always nicely indicates 'why something should be true,' which for a beginner will give them a intuition about the subject so that if they gain the backround mentioned above, they can dive farther into this subject by using other advanced books. Finally, this book should be used as a third year undergraduate text.  It should not be used as an advanced undergraduate/first year graduate text, since such courses should be more in depth and rigorous."

I was looking for a text which introduced nonlinear dynamics and all its interesting applications to professors and scientists whose common background included only 1 year of calculus. All I could find was higher level math books, which for the most part were very boring as they got lost in an orgy of math. This text introduces concepts using an intuitive, graphical approach. The mathematics is rigorous, but boring details are avoided. There are fantastic examples in all areas of science. I have often noted that there are many science texts but far too few good ones. This is a great one."

Strogatz creates and sustains a compelling narrative that always reminds you why you are learning this in the first place, and occasionally sacrifices rigour to sustain the overarching storyline. His voice shines through in this book and it's like he's there teaching the material to you, rather than just trying to present the facts in a complete manner. The exercises have hints given when the approach is not clear to a person first learning the subject (this is unusual, unlike texts like Artin's Algebra or any book by Hardy). As such this book does not exclude people of average intellect (such as myself) trying to learn the subject. Highly recommended reading for applied mathematics/mathematical physics students."

THIS BOOK, however, reads casually enough so that it doesn't get too dry.

It is probably most suitable for a 3rd or 4th year course. The level of mathematical rigor is a bit low, which will make the book easier for engineers and physicists but may leave mathematicians unprepared for a more advanced course."

It is really easy to follow and understand, even for people without background on nonlinear subjects. Yet, it is not the right book for engineers to read and start to solve their own detailed problems. People who seeks for a book to get into the subject or who wants to have a nice reference; BUY THIS BOOK. By the way, its price is reasonable."
