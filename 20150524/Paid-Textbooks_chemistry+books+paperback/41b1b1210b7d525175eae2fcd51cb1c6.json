                "Text": "I had high hopes for this book, expecting it to be a neutral textbook, but sadly the authors views shined through like a nuclear bomb. After just a few pages, all the talk of positive effects of nuclear energy and radiation made me ill... This book has nothing to do with medicine or health. This is, in my opinion, a highly political book. Pro-nuclear energy all the way. As a medical student hoping for a career in radiology as well as a Medical Peace Work student, I say stay away. I will be deleting this Kindle eBook in protest."
