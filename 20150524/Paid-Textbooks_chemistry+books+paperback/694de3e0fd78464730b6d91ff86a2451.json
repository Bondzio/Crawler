                "Text": "I agree with some of the other reviewers that there are notoriously few books on heat and mass transfer which are not heavy on mathematics -- which has to do with the subject! However, Middleman's book stands out in another respect: it tries to balance the motivation behind the maths with the mathematical derivations themselves and is therefore much more self-contained than many others. Personally, I found the use of non-SI units annoying, but that may not be a problem for US readers."

                "Text": "Very good book. Some say the equations are incorrect. The equations are not. You must must must pay close attention to how they define the variables before they use them. If you go by the definitions in your head then the equations may seem incorrect. The author is exceedingly thorough but it is hard to tell when he is changing gears. This is why I give it 4 stars and not 5"

                "Text": "PLEASE, if you are a professor considering the use of this book, STOP and reconsider.  This book is absolutely awful.  Middleman writes this book for the Calculus and Differential Equations expert.  If there was a class you EVER took, Middleman expects you to remember every single thing about it.  Important derivations are left as homework, with utterly insufficient preparation in the text.  Organization is awful.  Notation is about as consistent as the weather.  Important results are completely buried within long, unintelligable and, from time to time, erroneous derivations.  The reader is left unaware of what equations and concepts are important. If you are a student, do NOT take a course using this book.  I challenge a student to come forth with a good review for this book.  It simply is not possible... Stanley Middleman should be ashamed for beinging into existence something that ADDS to the complexity and inapproachability of Heat and Mass transfer.  He does his colleages and area of study a disservice."

                "Text": "This book is an excellent reference for heat and mass transfer for 3rd chem eng.  Yes, there is a bit of math, but if you find math at this level intimidating then perhaps you'd better rethink your career path (if that is not too much work as well!  The book contains numerous worked examples - a good \"learn by doing\" exercise.  I recommend it and will most likely adopt it as my principle text for teaching HMT."

                "Text": "This book makes people want to quit undergraduate chemical engineering at my school.  I'd rather do slave work in a mineshaft than to try to read this dry and abstruse book again!  What a waste of people's lives when professors force their students to try to learn from this book. The subject matter itself should be challenging part and not the presentation.  You know, I think when authors spent too many years using the concepts, they feel like what is obvious to them is good enough for any novice to understand.  I felt like I had to translate heiroglyphics and learn fluid dynamics at the same time.  Of course, I don't mean to be so depressing and leave anyone hanging.  A good book like Fundamentals of Heat&Mass Transfer should be like a day at disneyland compared to this book.  Schaum's outlines can be quite nice too. Good luck!"
