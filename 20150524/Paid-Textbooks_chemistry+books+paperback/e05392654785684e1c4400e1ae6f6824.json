                "Text": "Twenty five years since I've seen a classroom. I had a burning desire to  pick up where I left off. What I needed was a good introduction but I could  not find my \"Elements of Statistical Thermodynamics\" by K. Nash  (an excellent little book). So I tried Chandler's book, modern but not a  beginners text. For the true beginner, I'd suggest \"Intro. To  Thermophysics by Espinola, WCB  (c) 1994\". After Espinola, go to  Hill's book a great bridge at a bargin before going to Chandler. Hill's  style is clear but examples are given a condensed treatment. Not a problem  solving book, but a good book if physical understanding and a bridge  forward is your goal."

                "Text": "This is an ancient stat. mech. book with a lot of old topics. Most of the chapters after 8 (there are 22 I think) are directed towards chemical applications.  I think this book and McQuarrie are about even, Chandler is better if you know a little about stat mech already, much much worse if you know nothing.  This book is also really cheap so I don't think you can go wrong in getting it.  The explanations are pretty good in both this and McQuarrie, though I don't always like the organization of Hill."

As a matter of fact, there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic, but T.L. Hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way. In particular, I found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions (Part III). The last part is devoted to quantum statistics, it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening."
