Another person who was taking physics at the same time using the \"College Physics\" book often borrowed my text to understand the ideas and formulas better.  I really appreciated the tables of coversion formulas in the back cover, it was nice not having to Google or flip through the book all the time!"

It is very beaten up and old looking, like it has been banging around someone's trunk for 5 years.  It is certainly not worth the money I paid since I could have gotten a \"like new\" one at my bookstore here for about $10 more and not had to wait for it.  Boo!  This item was definitely misrepresented.  Normally I sell my textbooks back on here when the semester's over and don't lose too much money, but this one will be a bigger loss for me."
