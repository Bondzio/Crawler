                "Text": "I love physics, and I am a very through person.  I have found literally dozens of mistakes in the text.  Mainly errors in calculation or math, in-text references to figures or images are mislabeled, drawings for some sample problems are incorrect (feature the wrong coordinate system, etc.)  It is incredibly frustrating trying to learn from such an unorganized slop.  Text books are not only expensive but they are the foundation for your education an should not be thrown together without review.  I wish I could get a refund!!"
