                "Text": "I cannot sufficiently express my amazement at the geometry that is expressed in this book. The unification of seemingly bizarre sets of concepts into a geometrical \"whole\" is dazzling. The usefulness of this  view to get a better motivation and feel for physics is a primary benefit,  but the geometry that is presented here is satisfying in its own right.  And, the exposition of the book is immpeccable, adding greatly to its  beauty. This book is in a class with Feynman's \"QED; The Strange  Theory of Light and Matter\" and Epstein's \"Relativity  Visualized\". Buy it, as soon as possible..."

His geometrical derivations, however, provide wonderful insight into the true significance of the divergence,  gradient, and curl.  Shey's text (\"Div Grad Curl and All That\")  taught me to perform the calculations, but Weinreich taught me what those  calculations mean."

                "Text": "I hardly need to add another Highly Recommended to the list of reviews.  However, Professor Weinreich has assembled from his lectures an exceptionally interesting and intriguing geometrical approach to vectors.  Not the conventional directed line segment approach, but one which  questions which geometrical relationships are topologically invariant and  which are not. This is not a difficult book, but I suspect that the more  familiar the reader is with vector concepts, the more surprised and  appreciative he will be."

It was one of the easiest reads that I have ever encountered in a math book.  Everything is explained very well but a very interested student will have to go somewhere else to find meaning to many of the vector types.  I would have like to to see more detail on N dimensions or even four since that is what relativity requires.  Overall though a great book and an extremely easy read."

I quick gobble up the book and was fascinated by  the author's new approach to reinterpret the vectors with geometrical  intuition, particularly the approach of topologically invariants. If one  has problem to understand Berbard Schutz's Geometrical Methods of  Mathematical Physics Chapter 2 and 4, this book can certainly fill in the  gap. I appreciate the author's intention to keep this book affordable. (I  paid $16.) It is my belief that a good book got to be a short one like E.B.  White's the Elements of Style. No doubt in my mind this book fits into that  caliber."

                "Text": "Very interesting stuff but there is little consideration, if any, on how to tie this rather unorthodox presentation with almost every and any other book in or out of print. In contrast, \"Gravitation\" by Misner-Thorne-Wheeler offers the same geometrical insights in a way that ties nicely with whatever else one is likely to read about tensors and differential forms (two concepts about which Weinreich is mysteriously silent). So if you own Misner-Thorne-Wheeler you do not need Weinreich, and if you don't then you should, in which case you'll avoid Weinreich and learn some relativity theory too. However, after you read Misner-Thorne-Wheeler you may want to check your understanding of some concepts by seeing if you can find their equivalents in Weinreich's idiosyncratic treatment."
