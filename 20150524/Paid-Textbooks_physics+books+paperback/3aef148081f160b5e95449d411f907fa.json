                "Text": "Classic book that will provide you with a rigorous overview of the links between the conceptual properties and interesting empirical applications that make the study of the physics and mathematics of nonlinear surfaces really exciting. I think it's one of the best -- if not the best -- book of its kind. It was a brilliant move to include this outstanding book in the Dover series makes because that increases accessibility since the price of each book is affordable unlike most of the comparable excellent titles at say Springer. I've gained the ability to start applying this work to biological problems in microbiology (bacterial cell membrane properties such as protein permeability). I highly recommend this book."
