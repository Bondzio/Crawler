                "Text": "It is a pity that during my whole education as a physicist, I never heard about \u201cform/content distinction\u201d. It seems to me it is a very illuminating idea that I got after reading M. Friedmans\u2019s book \u201cFoundation of Space-Time Theories\u201d. It could be a little romantic, but I would rather call it \u201chuman/nature distinction\u201d."
