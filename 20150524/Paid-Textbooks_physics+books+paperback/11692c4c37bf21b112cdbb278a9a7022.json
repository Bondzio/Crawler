My son spends a lot of his free time reading and experimenting or building out of these books and it never feels to him like he's doing schoolwork. If you have other books from this series, then this is a must add for your collection. If you have never delved into this series of books yet, then start now!"

There is enough variety that you shouldn't have any trouble finding some to interest you. I will be mainly using them to teach the 8 to 13 year olds at church by finding a Scriptural principle to highlight with the activity. The kids look forward to this activity every week."
