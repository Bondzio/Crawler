And the best part is the free interactive download which allows students to build all kinds of circuits on the computer!"

                "Text": "I picked up this book to help me coach my daughter's science olympiad team.  It was helpful, but annoying to read.  I liked the experiments in the book, and the explanations were pretty accurate---but the chatty- folksy tone (i.e., \"by now I'm sure I've overloaded you with information\" or \"I'm sure this will confuse you\" or \"I'm sure you're ready for a break\") was condescending and made the book somewhat tedious.  I don't know much about electricity but I'm not an idiot either.  It seemed to take a lot of pages to explain fairly basics concepts because the author kept apologizing for how confusing they were..."
