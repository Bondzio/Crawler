There were very few sample problems worked out.  Basically all that was covered were definitions and equations.  I would not recommend this to anyone."

This was the earliest I've ever given up on a book.  Usually, even if the subject is extremely difficult, I can plow through a few chapters at least.  Not so with this book.  It became incomprehensible by the 3rd page.  It assumes you have a PhD. in physics already and is anything but basic."

                "Text": "A good book of this type should start with the simplest formula for the concept then add to it with more advanced formulas. This book instead just dumps a mid to high complexity formula on the reader and attempts to clear up the mess in the associated paragraphs. Thus it is more like an appendix for those that already know the material. A waste of time to learn from and a confused review. See the Elastic Modules formula where such a simple concept is shown with only one complex formula rather than with simple formula building to complex."

The only thing I would change about it would be to add an even quicker review section that lists the most important formulas in one place, and shows the relationships among them, as they tend to repeat. This would help with the memorization of the formulas, which is a daunting task."

It wasn't too helpful because many physics teachers teach physics very differently but maintain the same concepts. This book guides you differently. I found it to be no help to me at all. But I did purchase it for about eighty cents or so from the person."
