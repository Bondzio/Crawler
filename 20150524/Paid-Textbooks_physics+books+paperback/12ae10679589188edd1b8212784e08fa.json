                "Text": "Yes, this is the result of a research by Gerald Holton, the great science historian from Harvard. This is the latest rendition of the famous Abraham-Becker, which, in turn, descended from the text by Foppl, where Einstein scribbled his doubts. A great book for anyone, though. Crisp, conceptually very sound. Great discussion, and elegant use of the Helmholtz theorem on vector fields (\"if you know the Div and the Curl, you know everything\"). Very good treatment of relativistic electromagnetism, perhaps the best, very concrete and tied to experiments. Becker was a great science writer. In this Dover edition you get the bonus of Becker's lectures on Quantum Mechanics, very valuable by themselves. I love this book, and have taught from it many times."
