                "Text": "I volunteer tutoring physics to grade 8 -9 students and was looking for a book that is less math and formula intense but more focused on principles with simple examples. I couldn't be happier to discover this book. It does require a grade 8 level of algebra, Geometry and trigonometry and does not expect you be math wiz!. If you don't have a grade 8 level of math then work on math first. Mathematics made simple is a recommendation, covers to about grade 10. Physics made simple does not mean mathematically ignorant."

I'll admit, I've been out of school for several years, but this book is definitely NOT easy.  It (as many, many so-called \"easy\" books do) assumes that the reader already knows the basics of physics, algebra, and geometry/trigonometry.  I know practically nothing about any of the previous subjects, so I needed a REAL basic presentation of physics....this book was not it."
