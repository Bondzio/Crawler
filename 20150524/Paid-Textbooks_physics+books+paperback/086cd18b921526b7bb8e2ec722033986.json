                "Text": "When I learned Special Relativity I had been surprised to see that everything in it is named after other people, but somehow the theory is attributed to Einstein.  The author makes a good point that science is not well served with an at best over simplified view of how things really developed."

                "Text": "Roger has produced an excellent well researched analysis of the development of relativity. He questions whether Einstein deserves much credit. He is convincing in showing that if Einstein deserves any credit it is not much. I have published via KDP \"An Alternate  to Special Relativity\" that shows that two simple changes in Einstein's results allow a return to Newton's space with test results identical to Einstein's special relativity. I am preparing a book length article with tentative title \"Counter-Revolution in Physics\" which details why relativity should be abandoned. Knowing that Einstein was not totally independently responsible for relativity, I was hesitant to assign all of the problems in relativity directly to Einstein. Roger's book which indicates Einstein was not shy in accepting credit clears my conscience, if I inadvertently blame Einstein for an idea that actually came from someone else."

The book needs editing to take out redundancy.  The author repeats the same evidence too many times in too many of the chapters. It's well documented."

                "Text": "Ever see any of those old Star Trek episodes where Mr. Spock senses something significant, but with which he's wholly unfamiliar or it's somehow seemingly counterintuitive? In those scenes, he utters the word \"Fascinating\" while he observes the phenomenon at issue. Well, such is the case with Mr. Schlafly's new book about Albert Einstein. I'm fairly Spock-like. After reading this book once, that's my reaction. And I've decided to re-read it, that is, to continue to observe the phenomenon at issue. Fun read."
