All the important developments of twentieth century physics including relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics and particle physics are succinctly described and illustrated with figures and sample exercises. I would have appreciated a focus on the some of the more applied aspects of physics - and no less revolutionary ones - including chaos theory, biophysics, x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy. But what Griffiths does bring to the table is worth a look. Not much that you can't find in other equivalent books, but not a bad read either."

Like his textbooks this book for non science majors is well written and concepts are clearly explained. There are several exercises which are left for the reader to do which help reinforce understanding the material. My only criticism is that there are no answers to the exercises in the book and no website for the book where you can find answers to the exercises. Otherwise I would not hesitate to give it a five star rating."

I give this book an F grade because Griffiths doesn't even care to get speed and velocity right.  Griffiths says velocity is \"distance divided by time\"! WRONG!  Velocity is \"Displacement divided by time\".  Perhaps at Griffiths level not much attention is payed to the difference between speed and velocity, but there is a big difference between the two.  Furthermore, acceleration is the \"rate of change of velocity\"; NOT REALLY.  Acceleration is actually the \"TIME rate of changes of velocity\".  Yes, time, that pesky little denominator! For uniform circular motion, Griffiths states that \"a change in direction constitutes acceleration\". Unfortunately, Griffiths doesn't explain that which is changing - the velocity vector.  Vectors?  Huh?"
