                "Text": "The book's major contribution is that it distinguishes clearly between style and fundamentals. It focuses the reader's attention on the downswing and demonstrates the simple moves required to ensure club head acceleration  through to impact. By showing how these moves differ when the shaft is  above and below the horizontal and how certain other moves destroy club  head acceleration in these positions the reader will probably for the first  time come away with the true fundamental moves in a golf swing. The most  insightful book on golf I've ever read. If you can't handle equations read  the chapters for the less mathematically gifted - all the gems are still  there."

                "Text": "Only get this book if you love physics and want to analyze in detail mathematical models of golf swings and ball flight.  This book is written by a physicist, and it shows. The author does an admirable job of analyzing  the golf swing, but spends so much time describing how he built his models  that the \"so what\" gets lost in the details. If you're looking to  improve your golf game, other books will get you there with much less pain.  For example Dave Pelz is also a physicist, and his book, \"Putt Like  the Pros\" has very readable analyses and offers valuable and practical  advice."

I enjoyed Dr. Jorgenson's take on the game of golf and some of his personal experiences. He has analysed the various levers and moves and reduced everything to mathematical formulas so that presumably quantities could be inserted in the equations to see what effect differences for weight, speed, force, etc. would have on the outcome. As for the outcome everyone is looking for, he never answers the question that I'm sure everybody has, namely, \"what do I need to change to get more distance\"."
