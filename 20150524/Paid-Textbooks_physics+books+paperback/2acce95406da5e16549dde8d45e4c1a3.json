                "Text": "I am a theoretical physicist but I must admit I did not fully appreciate the Quantum Enigma until I read the first edition of this book a few years ago.  I first learned quantum mechanics over 40 years ago and have actively practiced it. That is, I used it to calculate theoretical predictions. It was only in the last 10 years or so that I asked myself, \"What is the electron actually doing when light is emitted from an hydrogen atom?\"  After reading this book I realized the answer is, \"Nobody has the slightest idea!\"  Fully appreciating the vast gap between the \"classical\" world we live in and the \"quantum world\" took some time for me. That kind of profound ignorance takes time to appreciate. I now better understand what I have read in biographical books about Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, and Schrodinger. As the realization slowly set in as to what quantum mechanics was saying, these men and other physicists struggled with each other in an almost religious battle. Now over 80 years later we know no more than we did then. In the end, everyone has to come to appreciate the profound ignorance we have at this point in history. For any interested layman or scientist, the Quantum Enigma is a must-read item."

It is clearly (and cleverly) written in an enjoyable style but it is also clear that these guys know their stuff, and have (somewhat amazingly) gotten precisely what is going on today in the quantum physics community down in a readable form for the non-specialist. There are plenty of books involving some wild speculations about quantum physics, but if you are a non-specialist and want to know what physicists themselves are really thinking, this is the book for you. I, frankly, have to give it seven stars."

                "Text": "An introductory text written for non-scientists that explains the difficult problems in interpreting the role of consciousness in quantum physics. The book is not mysticism and does not attempt to relate the findings of quantum physics to religious thought. Instead it presents how non-intuitive quantum physics is to our commonsense understandings of time, and the independence or lack of independence of reality from consciousness. (Which are major themes in mystical thought.) The book argues that future progress in physics requires an explicit consideration of consciousness, which has been avoided over the past 80 years. It also briefly reviews recent philosophical thought about consciousness, although discussion is very terse. It does an excellent job (in my layperson opinion) of explaining the key experiments in quantum physics that raised these questions of consciousness and reality."

The authors explore the possible relationship of quantum mechanics to consciousness, but are very careful not to make any grandiose claims (and they trash the pseudoscientific \"quantum\" nonsense found in pop culture drivel like \"What the [bleep] do we know?\" Highly recommended."

The authors walk the reader through the fascinating concepts of superposition, entanglement, wave/particle duality, etc., and do so in a way that, if you take the time to concentrate on what they are saying, these otherwise impossible concepts actually become understandable.  For someone with no real math background who wants to understand the world of the \"very small\", this book is outstanding.  The authors have done an superb job of introducing the subject and its history, as well as describing exactly what quantum theory is and how it is at the core of much of the techology we have developed since the early 20th century."

                "Text": "I was in the middle of \"A Clash of Swords\" when a friend recommended this book to me, and I immediately ordered it and put the Martin on hold. Quantum Enigma ended up being as riveting as Martin, and I plowed through it in a couple days. It's very clearly written, and you don't have to know any science going into it. It starts out, like most books in this field, with a brief overview of the history of QM. Which is actually great, cause I forget the details all the time. But the marrow is in the middle chapters, which they go over a couple times, and with good reason. It's pretty profound, and and stuff worth thinking over more than once. And then they wrap up with reactions and ramifications to the enigma, and the latest experiments related to it. The big thing to watch out for with this kind of book is pseudoscience, like the movie \"What the Bleep?\" -- which was somewhat painful to watch -- but these guys are about real science, and even make a point of distancing themselves from that movie at one point. Highly recommend it."

                "Text": "This book explains the problem ignored by so many physicists. It makes a compelling argument that the universe depends on the observer and somehow the universe may not be real or fit into the reality people are used to thinking about. I'm not through the whole book yet and I'm sure I'll want to re-read it, but it has me questioning if we really exist and even if we do exist, that the universe is nothing like people think. I have reached the part about Bells Theorem and this is the nitty gritty of the book I think. Highly recommended since it treats not just the quantum physics realities but how we people are an integral part of the reality we encounter in quantum mechanics that makes you question what existance really is."

They never once said anything like, \"Now in Newtonian physics, things work like this.......  but in Quantum physics things work like this....\"  Shame on them and their arrogance and/or closed mindedness.  It turns out creation is still an enigma to us mere mortals and all we are really doing is scratching the surface."

But if you do, this semi-laymen's view of quantum mechanics will literally open dimensions of a NEW WORLD for you.  Existence as a result of observation, parrallel universes, objects being in two places at the same time and the impact of God on our world are a few of the ideas discussed.  Not for the 'faint of heart' but truly an experience in a New World."

                "Text": "I've read this book several times -- first edition and second. It's not really hard to understand at all. The authors have a clear and to-the-point writing style--unusually entertaining for a non-fiction idea-oriented book of this sort. It IS hard to accept. What it is says is so disturbing to the prevailing world-view that I'm sure many people just shut it out by saying, \"Oh this is too hard to understand.\" That means they've probably understood it. Other readers may say, \"This is all old hat stuff. Nothing new here -- it's boring.\" That's probably someone who doesn't understand what the book is saying. The quantum experiments are about as simple (in principle) as it's possible to be (though some of them may require some awfully hi-tech equipment to conduct). While a knowledge of advanced mathematics  is needed to interpret the experimental results, you don't need much if any math to understand this book. It's more about the implications of the experiments. What kind of world is this? Is it real? What does \"real\" mean? Do things have any separate existence? How can things that have no known physical connection still be connected in some weird mysterious way? Hmmmn. I won't promise that you will find the answers to such questions in this book. But I think you may learn what the questions are and how to ask them. Knowing how to ask a question is, I believe, a large part of finding the answer."

                "Text": "\"Rosenblum and Kuttner therefore turn to exploring consciousness itself\" This is from the book description. This is untrue. They do not explore consciousness, at all. As a matter of fact, they severely limit it, as they really only mention free will as it relates to quantum experiments. They do not go any deeper into this topic than stating that if there isn't free will then we are all just deterministic robots with the illusion of free will, as this can't be scientifically tested they stop there. I thought this book being written by academics would be a benefit as it would stay away from new age-y, pseudoscience interpretations of quantum physics and consciousness, unfortunately the fact that they were academics was a mark against it. This book reads like a college course taught by someone who has spent too much time with academics and is therefore indoctrinated and unable to relate to non-specialists. They stress points that are simple to understand (There are three chapters that explain the quantum enigma, two by way of analogy. This is completely unnecessarily. Unfortunately, this is only one stark example of how they were pointlessly repetitive.) while just brushing over complicated concepts on the other hand that probably would have benefited from more explanation or the anecdotes or analogies that were mentioned in the description, which by the way, were generally not particularly good, nor well integrated into the content. They spend a lot of time talking about how physicists want to ignore the \"meaurement problem\" and how they go about doing so, which I really do not care about. How is this relevant? They mention experiments and articles that are being done on the subject of the quantum enigma but don't really go into any details about the goals, results and implications of these experiments, just that younger physicists have a lot of interest in it. Thanks. Again, not why I bought the book. There is one chapter that covers possible interpretations of the quantum enigma. I was hoping this chapter would make up for all the sludge I had to waddle through to get there, but, no. Disappointing. Most of them are cop-outs for how scientists get around the enigma (like quantum logic which changes the rules of logic so that there is no enigma, lame). The book mentions psychology a little bit, but mainly in a typical materialist way where consciousness is expected to be completely explained by brain activity... If I was you, I would not buy this book. Buy a book on introductory quantum physics and do some google searchs, you will get the same thing with less clutter. Their editor should be fired."

The authors said they weren't going to and they didn't. But then, that's because no one seems to really know what the role of consciousness or observation is in the micro or the macro world. Again, interesting, but a lot of repetition. It left me with two questions: In what ways will solving the enigma change the world? Does it really take a 287 page book to tell us it hasn't been solved?"

What a mistake ! If it wasnt for the other book, I would have returned this after reading a few pages. These are physics professors ? the language is so bad.. at many places it is more as if the authors are talking to you rather than writing a book ( if you know what i mean ) Unless you know what they are talking about, you cannot clearly understand what they are trying to get at. And so many typos and other grammtical mistakes and hard to read english. I am really disappointed. All the important points are glossed over ( they could have gone a little more into detail about what the physics ). I will not recommend this book."
