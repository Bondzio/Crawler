                "Text": "I used the equations in the \"Cars\" chapter of this book to write a sweet street racing game for my senior project. I'm not real good at math or physics but I could easily follow the explanations. It was the only game physics book I could find that gave the equations for acceleration based on engine torque. Great book."

                "Text": "I love this book. Not only is it easy to read, but it gives you a level of detail that other game physics books don't. For example in the sports chapter not only does the book go over the equations that govern the collision of a golf ball and club but it also provides the coefficient of restitution between the golf ball and club. I get really frustrated by other books that don't give you all the information and then you have to search around for the missing pieces. This book gives you all the information you need to write realistic game programs. It's also packed full of interesting historical trivia."

The author very clearly explains the physics behind many common everyday siutations, and make the programming understandable and easy to follow. The downloadable examples are good feature. I recommend it for both beginners and experienced programmers."
