                "Text": "I read Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time in a creation and cosmology class around 12 years ago, and I recall that it was an excellent book so I had high expectations for this book.  This book is good but not great.  First off, this book is clearly written and I feel that it brings a subject that could be complicated into layman's terms.  Some people obviously would end up liking this book because they make some good arguments.  Unfortunately, I don not find their main argument about M-theory being some form of a unifying theory of the universe too compelling.  Not being a physicist, I cannot claim any deep knowledge of M-theory but I just find that the authors' conclusions are speculative, at best."

Most of the book is, as others have noted, a review of introductory modern physics, but not with much depth.  I too was stunned at the ending which sort of pulled a rabbit out of a hat with \"Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.\"  It may well be that M-theory leads to that, but I didn't feel prepared at all for that leap.  The missing preparation is the book's problem for me."

                "Text": "Good book. It's incredibly short, hardly a novella in length. It's extremely easy to read and very light on the \"hard\" stuff, but it gets into heady territory when talking about God and the theories of creationists. The book is basically a credal statement for those who want to prove that God neither exists nor is necessary. Once we learned that the Earth is only one of billions of planets in a universe of countless galaxies, we realized that we humans were not necessarily special: we're not the universe's \"one and only\". Now that M-theory is gaining acceptance, the reality of multiple universes is also becoming apparent. This would mean that even our universe is not unique. With multiple universes, the authors argue, there is no need for anything special to have occured to ours, we're just one of many countless universes. The argument is well presented, the book is easy to follow, and the book is recommended."

I'm still not sure that the universe is comprehensible no mater how hard the scientists try to make it but I find that this book helps! The words are well chosen to lead you through the world of Quantum Theory, Alternative Histories and The Theory of Everything. Whether or not you can understand your surroundings are up to your education, imagination and in a large part your spiritual beliefs. I found the book to be an informative introduction to a wonders of the universe (as we understand them today!)"

The double split experiment was brought up countless times to describe the probabilistic interpretation of a particles position. While that in itself didn't bother me as the book is catered to the masses, when it came to controversial or complex quantum theory like Feynman sums and using them to explain how every possible history that can occur is, has, or will, the authors seemed to either assume people wouldn't get it anyway so \"why bother\" or they didn't understand it or believe it themselves enough to explain it any further and instead left the reader with a one or two paragraph general statement that often caused me to go back and ask, what? How did they just make that logic leap? Most people read this book to learn how M-theory answers all of the question the previous reviews refer to, me included, but what I got instead was an overly simplified view of quantum mechanics that I already knew."

                "Text": "While no-one can argue the rightfully earned position occupied by Stephen Hawking in the world of modern physics, that doesn't mean he and Leonard Mlodinow can write, or express complex ideas well. This effort falls well short of any of the hype and positive reviews it has received. Too many concepts are explained for the hundredth time (such as time dilation or the double slit experiment); if the reader doesn't already understand these ideas, they have absolutely no chance of understanding them from this book. If they do understand them already, they have seen a dozen explanations that do a far better job of unveiling quantum peculiarities and possibilities. The book also declares on the first page that philosophy is dead, but then later re-invokes it many times, although their use of non-scientific terms, such as philosophy, are literally \"tossed around\" without any of the precision, attention to detail, or supposed research that is a must in a book like this. After a weak tour of physics 101 covered poorly for 175 pages they then use only the last couple of pages to show us how the universe came out of nothing - after previously explaining quantum jitters!!!! How can these fields possibly represent \"nothing\" from which the universe came and where is the explanation of where the quantum jitters or gravity came from for that matter. And if the point with The Game of Life is to show us how life came from nothing, it is no wonder the theologians and philosophers are jumping all over this gaping failure in trying to make the whole point of the book. Lest you believe I'm bashing this from a Christian viewpoint, I am a physicist who simply would like to see this material presented more effectively to the world. Check out anything by Brian Greene!!"

But this time for The Grand Design, my pleasure of reading it has been delayed until the very end but still not quite yet there. I feel the book is quite like an introductory, popular science book rather than an in depth texts for someone who keeps interested in tracking the subject of Big Bang and General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics  and Unified Theory... The book spent too much chapters to comb through the ancient cognition of the origin of the Universe that almost everyone is familiar with. When it finally starts to touch the M Theory that I am so excited to learn more about, it just stopped without enough information for a decent understanding of the subject. And The Grand Design's argument is not quite convincing as it is not even developed before the conclusion is suddenly drawn. Well, I guess I need to find other further readings to fill in the blank. Well, if you don't raise your expectation of this book as high as before your reading of the History of Time Series, then you will still quite enjoy this one."

                "Text": "The title of the book, \"The Grand Design\", belies the actual content between the covers. This work is an elementary description of current cosmologic thought on the origins of the universe in terms readily understandable by most layman. However, Hawkings and Mlodinow seem to make this their holy grail quest to disprove the existence of God. The proof of God is a philosophic argument without direct observations available for comment by the scientific community. The same can be said for the M-theory. As the authors point out, the \"theory\" has yet to be confirmed by observations. The history of the development of this theory is nicely laid out by the authors, making note of the fact that it requires \"renormalization\" to make the possible answers fit the observations. This is what is otherwise known as fudging. The lack of direct observations, required by scientific determinism rather than faith, seems to pose no problem to the authors in having the world accept M-theory as the equation describing the \"Grand Design\". The authors attempt to solve the greatest philosophic question of the universe by having the readers believe mathematics is the universal truth rather than being a means to an end. This is the crux of the problem with this work. As Fodor and Palmarini pointed out in their book, \"What Darwin Got Wrong\", it is not that the science behind the apparent evidence is wrong, but that the conclusions drawn from those observations are misinterpreted and misapplied. I would have enjoyed the book more if it had dealt more with the history and science of cosmology, rather than the philosophic conclusions drawn from the lack of direct observation supporting a theory in need of physical proof."

Stephen comes up with an incredibly simple illustration of a very complex quantum law which is completely understandable to one with no detailed knowledge of Quantum theory and he maintains this standard throughout the book. I admit to a little bias since I have known Stephen for 60 years, but I bought the book because after reading a Brief History of Time, I knew I had found someone who could explain the most worrying aspects of creation in an undestandable way to me. This book takes up where Universe in a Nutshell was proceeding but tackles the more theoretical aspects of Quantum Theory and the origins of the Universe. Whilst I know Stephen is sceptical about God, because a belief in miracles would posit an exception to scientific laws, I still believe that Stephen was created by God to imbue us with answers to questions no other person on earth could answer."

Well written, explains extraordinarily difficult concepts well with good use of mental models, and even manages to inject occasional humor into a difficult topic.  That said, it is extremely disappointing that Amazon and the editors would release an e-book where every graphic and subtitle has a portion of the left margin cut off on the Kindle screen. If this was a hardcopy book, I'd be returning it for a new one. Unfortunately, that's not an option for the Kindle."

For someone who hasn't read the latest in the theories on spontaneous creation from quantum fluctuations and the multiverse ideas it is certainly a great read."

At one time in history, philosophers pondered reality, scientists measured it, and priests invented strange gods to account for the unknown.  Today, serious scientists ponder reality and invent strange forces to account for the unknown.  I've always admired Stephen Hawking's intelligence and insight, and respected Mlodinow's previous work, Drunkard's Walk, but this collaboration seems to have an agenda to replace possibility of \"Intelligent Design\" with the impossibility of \"Spontaneous Creation\".  Multiple gods have been replaced with multiple universes without any physically measured evidence or justification."

                "Text": "Stephen Hawking is the Einstein of his generation and this book is a better attempt at educating his generation to physics than his previous books. With his landmark book \"A Brief History of Time\" he captured the imaginations of an entire generation of the non-science educated masses. Unfortunately, only a few MIT professors could read and understand, \"A Brief History of Time.\" With \"The Grand Design\" he brings such items as the M-Theory, the four forces of nature and the search for a Grand Unifying Theory (the theory to unite the macro and micro in physics) down to the level where even a former sports reporter can understand. The greatest criticism of the first book was that it was too complicated to understand, this one would be it is a little too oversimplified. But Hawking is striving to reach even more and to educate them to physics and the world of science. For anyone looking to get an overall view of the physics world this is an excellent place to start. The basic thrust of the book is that there might not be one Grand Unifying Theory and that there are different answers at different levels. Another arguement that he puts forth, and does throughout the book, is how science and reason can refute religion and mythology.  This is a well-executed book and should lead to investigating more in the realm of physics."

                "Text": "For a man hailed as one of the greatest thinkers of our time,  I was a bit surprised at the obvious conclusions that were overlooked when employing M-theory and gravity as the catalyst for a theory of everything. When this book, which was at best an interesting review of modern physics, is reduced to it's base, you are left with one faith versus another...no proof. When an untestable theory is offered as proof, how is that any different than intelligent design? At best, this  attempt to explain creation only moves the quest  back a notch, and we're still left asking the very same questions the book claims to answer.  As far as the writing, I can appreciate the author attempting to make the content understandable to the lay-person, but it still was a bit droning...and the dry humor sprinkled in, did little to counter that. I would only recommend the book if you are interested in getting up to date with the theories that mainstream science posits  to try to disprove God."

Hawking gives it his best shot. Of course, the idea of multiple universes and how they can appear out of nothing really becomes a chicken and egg construct. Early in the book he describes how a goldfish bowl universe can have provable laws of physics that are easily refuted by an observer outside the bowl. The author does indeed say our science may operate within a limited confine. How many layers of observers exist?  Hawking is an atheist and this book attempts to use physics to squish transcendent philosophy; I get it. He would likely explain away  profound spiritual experiences as a neural aberration of ischemic stroke. But, if the reality they describe is true, physics won't ever write a formula for it."

I do think that religious people will have a problem with this publication as Stephen Hawking makes his atheism pretty apparent.  While I'm not an atheist (I am more agnostic and decide to live by the golden rule), I do see how it could be difficult to convince a religious individual since many theories over the course of history have been debunked and even the current theories that can't be tested could be debunked. I am still left wondering how does one *really* know, one way or the other? A 200-paged publication obviously will not have all of the answers."

Unfortunately, while I have no doubt in my mind Hawking is a brilliant man, I am by no means brilliant enough to come through this work retaining even the milk skin surface of what he's talking about. Every here and there information is presented that makes me consider the universe in different ways than I have in the past, but soon after the migraines start up and I need to wash the concepts away with Maker's Mark before they leave me in a raging zombified state unfit for modern world functioning."

It was very interesting and once I started it I could'nt put it down. Before I knew it I had finished within a day! If you are interested in physics and the creation of the Universe but are not a scientist pick this book up. If you have been reading books of this sort for years I would say skip it because there is probably not much new here. The book poses questions such as \"Why are we here?\" and \"How were we created?\" If you are looking for those answers from this book then you're out of luck and essentially out of luck no matter what book you pick up. Nevertheless the book was perfect for me and I got exactly what I wanted out of it and that was a general understanding of quantum physics, the creation of the universe and the confidence to pick a more elaborate, more detailed book of the same material."

This book is very good but it is not an easy read.  I found myself having to re-read thing and spend time trying to grasp what is written.  That is not always a bad thing as it forces us to think and expand our thoughts.  I have read other books on quantum theory and multiverse and that book too was very difficult to comprehend.  I find that I have to force myself to focus and think through everything, but that can be fund as well at times.  The idea of multiverse is amazing and is hard for every day people to comprehend.  The book does a good job of trying to explain it all and pushes quantum theory forward as science tries to understand why the universe is hear and the idea that our universe is not alone.  Good read, but be ready for some complex topics."

The downside is that though its not too difficult to understand in the beginning, it abruptly becomes quite complicated toward the end. Apart from that the final conclusion is not very convincing (maybe due to lack of proper and detailed explanation) for an average mind like mine. At the face of it the final conclusion relating to M-Theory and Multiverse quite far fetched. When I searched the book on the net I found a lot of critique to the final conclusion hence there are many far far brighter minds that agree with me - maybe for different reason(s).  In summary, I enjoyed the book, can boast to my friends that I read Stephen Hawking's latest book but I would need more material to fully understand the concept as the final chapter does not explain it enough."

Though not as comprehensive scientifically as that 20 year old work, this one is perhaps more accessible to the lay person. That said, I am not much closer to understanding the origins of the Universe, as abstractions such as \"no boundary\" and \"multi universe\" remain for me elusive mathematical concepts, as I am sure they do to many. Also the apparent conclusion that \"there is no God\" seems to be replaced by \"there is Gravity, but we don't know exactly what that is ...\". Still, a worthwhile and easy read at under 200 pages."

Hawking elegantly formed a masterpiece book. I also loved the Brief History of Time and read it nonstop till I finished in three days. I love Hawking's works. I saw the movie The Theory of Everything recently also. It was the best movie I have seen in a while. I cried a lot and loved the part where they show Hawking saying something like \"where there is life there is hope\"."

Yes, throughout all of the M-Theory lead ups, he keeps the readers interest by making the stories interesting & not talking about himself & his theories the entire time!  Last time I read a theory book that was the case (turned me off from the genre since this book). Since I am not familiar with this particular genre, I found myself reading aloud at parts to get a better understanding of the concepts (like the early Ionian's he names).  But it's definitely worth the purchase.  I closed this book with my mouth open.  Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of our time."

Some forty years of Hawking's own research and a recent series of astronomical observations lend to new arguments that the scientific concern with the unified theory may be misplaced, and that a web of theories might hold the key to the universe's mysteries. Science and general holdings alike will relish this survey!"

                "Text": "Hawking and Mlodinow's The Grand Design is primarily a defense of M-Theory, which the authors describe as \"the unified theory Einstein was hoping to find\" (p. 181), and brief explanations of some of the theories which comprise it.  Hawking seems to defend M-theory by asserting that it replaces the need for consideration of a prime mover or first cause.  It's an odd little book because Hawking turns relativity and quantum physics into a theological argument to knock god or the need for god out of the universe by substituting the \"laws\" of physics and trying to prove conclusively that the universe and we \"just are\" through the interactions of these laws.  It's a grandly designed argument to show that something can come from nothing and that one does not have to take the big bang hypothesis for the beginning of the universe \"on faith,\" answering the argument by theists that science is a form of religion.  The opposite of faith perhaps is knowledge, or at least Hawking seems to think it is, and his argument against faith in the \"big bang\" is just another way the reader senses the theological nature of this treatise. Hawking approaches physics in this book with the reverence of a priest and the lucidity of the experienced preacher.  M-theory, I guess, is the quantum genesis myth for the universe and what came after, exchanging the Biblical account with the unified theory account.  Those of us, however, who do not understand quantum physics will just have to continue to accept on faith that the universe sprang from nothing and after billions of years we were because, despite Hawking's efforts, we still lack the knowledge necessary to comprehend the argument from quantum physics.  The theological nature of the work is intriguing; even the title, probably by intention, evokes theological writings."

Its view of the universe, I might add, is complemented by another book that came out at roughly the same time: THE SHAPE OF INNER SPACE. While THE GRAND DESIGN takes a large-scale view of the universe, in covering the broad sweep of cosmology, THE SHAPE OF INNER SPACE views things on a much smaller scale, focusing on the inner workings of the universe, which may stem from the geometry of postulated \"hidden dimensions,\" too tiny to be seen. Both books are highly recommended, and the composite picture that one can get from reading them both is quite amazing."

Hawking and Mlodinow explore the fascinating and counterintuitive world of quantum physics to make their point. They conclude that M-theory is the most promising candidate for the elusive theory of everything. This is actually not a single theory but a collection of theories with each describing a particular aspect of the universe. The authors write with wit, which makes for an enjoyable read. However, their main thesis is not clearly threaded throughout the book. This creates a disjointed narrative. The chapters do not seem to build upon each other to create a focused argument for their thesis. A nice read, but I often lost track of the main point of the book."

Just to conclude that using available science, no form of creator (forget religion) is needed to justify our creation. I really have been thinking that such possibility is really probable for long time. This book gave me additional tools to go much deeper in such thesis. While the book is written with a wide audience on mind, I feel that having at least college physics and related math would help you to understand concepts more clearly and enjoy more without guessing that such concepts make sense."

I see this book more of a survey on the subject (physics and especially modern physics), which is explained in a very simple and understandable manner. But if you happen to be a physics major and have a deep knowledge about modern physics, you might only find few pages of this book to be really new to you (if you find any)."

I was hoping for some new insights, but this book held little that was new to me in either area, physics or philosophy.  It was as if, almost, that Hawking was looking to be controversial, to get on the \"there is no god\" bandwagon.  Richard Dawkins does such much more interestingly.

While we are not yet at a true unified field theory of the universe, the standard model does match experimental results and even predicted several new particles that have since been discovered. There is some humor thrown in now and then, but it seems a little out of place with the rest of the physics info.  I just wish he would have talked more about god and the fact that we don't need her.  A great book for people new to cosmology."

I am bothered though, by his failure to acknowledge his M-theory as theory.  Some physicists do not believe that the M-theory is fact but rather is an ultimately unprovable scientific theory bordering on a religious belief.  It would be nice if Dr. Hawking would have presented it honestly as controversial-with some credible detractors.  I did very much enjoy the text.

                "Text": "A general overview of the current state of cosmologists' understanding, detailing theories of existence and how and why reality works. It is more brief and compact than other such books, which helps lay readers as it elides the wonkier calculations and instead explains complex concepts with simple metaphors and thought experiments. They authors' tone is dry and analytical, though laced with subtle humor that makes it fresh and highly readable. I followed it well enough until the second to last page, where the authors attempt to answer the book's fundamental question, \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\" This was answered in a glib and perfunctory way, requiring reference to a concept of \"positive\" and \"negative\" energy that hadn't been mentioned earlier and that I couldn't follow -- the discussion of it seemed, to me, logically inconsistent. (For example, gravity is \"negative\" energy but a black hole's energy is \"positive\" -- huh?) This is no fatal flaw if, like me, you didn't read the book expecting an actual answer. However, it is somewhat out of place in a book otherwise so lucid and methodical, and leaves a bit of an aftertaste."

It's also sneeringly patronizing, the \"jokes\" are rubbish, and it is far, far too sure of its conclusions. It's actually quite ironic that the books goes to great pains to show how science has evolved over the centuries, yet finishes in a manner that smacks of \"that's it, we know everything, no more silly questions please\". This could have been a great book. Instead it feels like the SUMMARY of a great book....narrated by a really annoying person."

As a book topic, you can't be more ambitious than that. Although I found their reasoning sound, and I don't disagree with any of their conclusions (except one), I don't believe this is the final chapter of this story. There is one final piece, the answer to the question of why this perfect storm of physics created life. Yes, I understand the argument that if you try an infinite number of ways to make soup, sooner or later you're going to get chicken. That's the power of infinity. But I was taught in school that using infinity is cheating because it presupposes the answer. The theory of alternate histories says the probability of our universe existing is infinitesimally small. The fact that we do exist doesn't contradict that statement; it just means we're missing something. Although I believe this is a great book, in my view it needs a final chapter that doesn't rely on infinity to prove its case. I suspect there is much more to this mystery than we can now even imagine."

I really learned a lot of basic stuff from this book. Note that it is not for the more advanced: it is a real basic, \"Quantum Physics and the Universe for Dummies\" kind of book. Short, easy to comprehend and with great pictures to enhance one's understanding of the material presented. Hawking makes a few statements that I consider odd--no, not the one about the universe not needing any gods to get started, I am totally in agreement with that--but his matter-of-fact statement, right out of the gate, that philosophy is dead. Really? I studied it a bit at university and felt that it still has something to say to us. But whatever; if Hawking wants to pound nails into philosophy's coffin, in my opinion way prematurely, well then let him. Suffice to say that if you want to know a little about quantum theory and how it relates to the origins of our universe but you aren't in a position to quit your job and study this 18 hours a day for years (which is probably what it would take to REALLY get this stuff down), this short little book will make you feel smarter after you've read it, and won't give you a migraine trying to understand the material."

                "Text": "I appreciate what the authors are doing to introduce M-theory, string theory, and other recent theories in quantum and astrophysics. I am by no means an expert, and at some points in the book I admit to being a bit lost, despite my best efforts. I find some of these newer theories fascinating, but I still am struggling to understand how Hawking and Mlodinow can simultaneously use the term \"design\" in the book's title while disavowing a \"design-er\". I'm not trying to argue for the existence of God, but I didn't appreciate how quickly the authors dismissed religion and mythos as the backwards folk traditions of a superstitious age. Perhaps the nature of the target audience didn't allow them to further explain their position, but discarding these ancient ideas without adequate attention to them comes off as flippant and perhaps evidence of the authors' lack of understanding of these disciplines. Additionally, at one point they claim that modern philosophy no longer attempts to tackle the big questions of \"why\", and then claim that science has stepped in to do the job. I was dismayed to realize that these two brilliant men of science were making huge assumptions and errors about the nature, currency, and importance of religious and philosophical tradition. Ironic, for their book invites the reader to take on another set of theories and propositions that cannot be observed or consciously experienced as the \"truth\" about \"reality\". In short, they invite the reader to believe in something they cannot see, feel, or even truly contemplate (11 dimensions, multiple universes, and other mind-bending concepts, for example). In the end, the transcendence of science ends up feeling a lot like the transcendence of what others have been calling \"God\" for thousands of years."

                "Text": "Wide ranging topics explored by the physicist combo, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.  Looking at material world from a quantum perspective, author claims there is no free will (p. 32), though free will is likely more a process than a physiological response to some stimuli.  What author describes in this section is the how and not the why or what; therefore free will is more an extension of human reason or the why of one's action or non-action. One of the more interesting though highly speculative topics is multiple universes under \"The Apparent Miracle\" chapter.  The upshot is that if there is a random process underpinning all, i.e., all generative processes, then universes come and go; though lucky for us ours is still here! In the last chapter, authors contradict their \"philosophy is dead\" statement in the first chapter, by posing philosophical questions: Why! Why! Why!  Certainly the sciences have eclipsed previously explanatory disciplines - e.g., theology - though authors fail to convince and barely substantiate that physics will be able to get us beyond the hows to the whys of existence.  Maybe this really is the \"mother\" of all mysteries."

I must mention that it is unfortunate that some have made this book about Professor Hawking's lack of belief in a personal God, possibly discouraging some people of faith from reading it. One may believe what one wants about God, but it is necessary to distinguish between beliefs based on faith and the scientific method of verification. Most people of faith no longer look at epilepsy as a form of demonic possession, as they did in biblical times, but as a treatable medical condition. In this case they have accepted the scientific method of experimentation, observation, and investigation over centuries-old superstition. On this basis of distinction, they can also accept the science which is presented in this book, regardless of their agreement or disagreement with Professor Hawking on the matter of a personal God."

I have become extremely interested in cosmology in recent years as a way to show how all things taught in science are related.  I have read quite a number of texts and each helps with my understanding on one issue or another, so I keep looking for explanations from different perspectives .  I found a few explanations of the quantum world in this book very helpful.  However, the principle thrust did seem to promote the authors views on God and on M theory.  I could find no referencing or suggestions for further reading. To make there case, the authors speak of a number of theories and interpretations of evidence as though they are universally accepted, which I suspect are not.  For instance, they rely heavily on the theory of inflation, for which I did not see, on my reading, credit given to Alan H. Guth. I do not know how generally this theory is accepted, but a look at the April 2011 issue of Scientific American provides some idea.  I did, however, find the authors personal views interesting.  Finally, as another reviewer noted, the size of print used for the authors names raised questions.  I too felt this was better written than other Stephen Hawking books."

At first I thought is was going to be a Richard Dawkins kind of book. Where they fight against Religion, but that was not the case. This book blended God into science fact as causes of some of the phenomenons that we see in the universe.

Essentially, this is a heavy book in that alot of advanced physics concepts are discussed.  Hawking does a pretty good job of adapting the theories for us regular people but there are still some areas that I felt were a little hard to follow.  Overall he does a good job of explaining the multiverse theory as well as alternate histories and basic quantum theory.  He also tries to definitively answer the question of intelligent design or mathematical certainty.  I'm not sure he made a real good argument for either side but overall this book is a good read."

It gives one a good idea of the complexity of our universe and does so in an understandable way.

With this lucid explanation of what is going on in the mind of the theorists, it becomes more clear the role of mathematical modeling behind the Physics.  It seems to me that the necessary modeling to prove the Theory of Everything proves too much.  I quit where the description of the extremely low probabilities of things being the way they are is just chance because there are so many universes.  It is easier for me to have faith in God than to take that leap of faith.  But I could never be a theoretical physicist."

Everything else was not new information to me so I breezed through it, but someone who is not familiar with it, might have a hard time. That said, I think this is a great book if you're looking to refresh your knowledge and for that I think it deserves the five stars. I'll just have to read the last part again."

I mean religious, psychological, mathematical, philosophical, existential and even some humorous parts. I like the pace of this book, how he covers history of the understanding of our world and (in spite of his saying philosophy is dead) his logical and philosophical approach to a complex subject I would have otherwise never understood.  I'm glad he left out the math equations because I have seen those in other books and failed to understand them anyway. This is a really exciting time we live in and to miss knowing something of these theories and discoveries before I die (or pass into another dimension, ha ha) would be truly sad."

I must say this book really captivated me. I was very happy with a lot of the quantum theory explanations since this is an area that has always been unclear to me (as it probably is for most people).  The ideas and explanations of other possible dimensions and universes is such a mind blowing and imaginative subject.  Whether or not the theories in this book turn out to be true or false its refreshing to read subject matter that goes so far beyond the ordinary.  Say what you want about Stephen Hawking but the man is brilliant and has done a lot for cosmology not only in coming up with ground breaking theories but also for bringing these complicated ideas and theories to a level that us mere mortals can comprehend."

A clue was on the first page or two where we were told that philosophy was dead and only physicists could could now answer the hard questions. If so, Hawkings is not among those who can. The banal attempts at humor could be forgiven if the contents otherwise justified reading the book. There is no comparison in content or quality to (such as) the many books by John Gribbin, Paul Davies, or David Lindley, which basically cover the same material, plus much more. Hawkings does coin the phrase, \"model dependent reality,\" and then forgets it entirely in advocating particular solutions to basically unsolved problems...in-so-far as meaningful material was covered. Do not buy this book. Instead, try Russell Stannard's \"The End of Discovery.\""

These new developments are not as exciting as those in the twentieth century, I feel. A drawback on this book is: those who have read Stephen's previous books may find background information in early chapters repetitive (except Chapter 3 which is an inspiring philosophical view). On the other hand, those who have not read his previous books, or other books on similar subject, may find the background not sufficently detailed and therefore may not easily appreciate the theme expressed in later chapters. Maybe this is a regretable dilemma."

If you have some knowledge about their field of expertise the book doesn't give new insights, but if you never have read anything on cosmology go ahead and buy it. All in all, I think the authors, nevermind how much respect one must have for them based on their overall work,should be ashamed to come up with so much old information and knowledge and represent it as new in order to sell well."

He loses scientific stature, however, by imposing himself into existential questions outside of the realm of science. He appears to be so convinced of his authority that he offers opinions outside of his expertise and without a scientific basis. He has made other decisions lately regarding where he will visit, publicly available, which are purely political and inappropriate. His stature, for me, is diminished."

What the Grand Design claims is that philosophy is dead and replaced by physics, specifically cosmology.  This modern physics is based not on direct observation (the stuff they are modelling are too small or too big or too far away to observe directly) but on mathematical models that can explain the indirect effects of the cosmos that we humans can observe.  You can match some mathematical model to any set of data if you make the model complex enough (like assuming ten or eleven dimensions instead of the more logical three or four).  This complex mathematical modelling in my book is not science, it is philosophy (an explanation (model) of the cosmos that cannot be observed and tested).  The problem with calling these models scientific is that science implies a level of observation and testing that has not (I think cannot) be accomplished.  You may believe in M-theory, I might limit my beliefs to direct  observation, someone else might believe is theology.  None of these beliefs can ever be proven and it is all philosophy."

From the brief introduction, the book then transitions into a history of theories that have lead up to the ones we now have. It explains how the discoverers of such theories were at first thought of as crazy or opposing of God. Hawking explains the downfalls of not accepting such theories based on belief in god (even many of the scientists that made such theories, doubted at first their discovery because in their mind it seemed to doubt god), such is reason why so many religious believers and philosophical minds rated this book poorly. Scientific discoveries have indeed killed many philosophical beliefs of Aristotle and other such classical philosophers, and as bold as it may seem to religious believers, some laws of the universe have indeed pulled biblical stories into doubt. Great book for those interested in physics, philosophy, science, and religion."

Hawking and Mladinow take the reader through the history of last 400 or so years of theoretical physics, helping us understand the significance and the impact of the more recent quantum physics research and theories: gravity, relativity, space-time, multiple histories, and so on. In the process, they tackle a number of existential questions (\"Why are we here?\", \"How were we created?\", ...) and propose a remarkably complete set of answers and theories to answer each one - whether they are correct or not, we don't know, but it is nonetheless the best, and most consistent overview I've read to date."

It just doesn't do it for me!...it's just a force...it needs an object to act on and do anything, and then you are back to square one:  where did the object come from?  So, he didn't really explain that.  Actually, I think if anyone is afraid that science is going to be overrun by superstitious religion, or conversely that science is overreaching its capacity, I would recommend the 96 page paperback \"God and Stephen Hawking\" by Dr. John C Lennox; especially the chapters on science and rationality and the laws of nature.  If we are ever to have a reasonable discussion about science and religion (minus the overheated science wars), Lennox's writings Provide a better background understanding."

Because it is so simple language wise, I found it a bit dumbed down and didnt hold my interest as I had anticipated, but that may be a premature judgement.  I read 4 to 6 books a week in several fields and have done so for years, so it may be that they wrote the book to appeal to a general audience.  But something gets lost in translation in doing that.  I speculate as dont know for sure, but that is my best guess.  the subject matter is fascinating however, but.....as stated above."

                "Text": "I really enjoyed A Briefer History of Time so I picked this up. While I enjoyed it I liked A Briefer History of Time much more. The Grand Design is very interesting when you can understand it. I realize the authors did their best to break down complex science to make it understandable but much went over my head. Of the parts I felt I understood I found it thought provoking. Based on all the science the authors leave no room, or need, for God. They deny that there are miracles because they would interrupt the laws of nature making the laws void. I would just contend that's why it's called a miracle and that's the proof of something/someone outside of nature interacting with nature. Near the end of the book they write, \"But perhaps the true miracle is that abstract considerations of logic lead to a unique theory that predicts and describes a vast universe full of the amazing variety that we see.\" They are willing to call it a miracle that we are close to a theory of the universe but deny that other miracles can occur. Pick this up if you're a Hawking fan but you'll be disappointed if you're hoping for another Briefer History of Time."

The book itself is sometimes exciting and sometimes tedious. At the end I am left with the impression that while Professor Hawking wants to believe that natural laws acted to cause creation, that he himself has doubts and leaves some room for God. I guess each reader will have to decide how good is the case for natural law or if there is a role for God."

His conclusions that the universe is a self creating entity with many possible  universes and that god is not necessary  i.e. we don't need the divine \"black box\"  as  the source of all life and matter and being and answer why and how man is here on earth are rational and thoughtful. The rebuttal comes from the Bible, a written literal and figurative  account of a god, and the first hand eye witness accounts  of god incarnate as Jesus Christ.  The old historical manuscripts have survived to verify God visiting man on earth, and why God did so.  There is enough empirical observations that mankind has a  natural behavior of behaving badly i.e. sin, and that supernatural events still occur i.e. miracles that can not be explained by mathematical string theory and the sum of histories that God is real and visited earth to save mankind from destroying itself with bad behavior.  Until science can create life from dead material (cloning and genetic engineering work from living material), God as revealed in the wonderful organization  in the natural world and universe, and in the eye witness accounts of Jesus Christ makes God the true unified answer for all of our intelligent questions on how, when, why, and where  we exist."

They've got a model that excludes God. So what? Models aren't reality. They begin the book by saying philosophy is dead, and then spend the next 200 pages or so proving they know nothing about philosophy. I was far more impressed by John Polkinghorne in his book, \"Exploring Reality\"."

                "Text": "The Hawking-Mlodinow multiverse explanation for the origin of the Universe in THE GRAND DESIGN is rational and plausible. It is, of course, not a very happy one for us humans since it is all a matter of purposeless and pointless processes. In my books, THE GOD THEORY and THE PURPOSE-GUIDED UNIVERSE: BELIEVING IN EINSTEIN, DARWIN AND GOD, I acknowledge the logic behind the multiverse concept, but elaborate on an equally logical interpretation based on a remark by astrophysicist Sir James Jeans that \"the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine.\" There is a wealth of anecdotal evidence in the transcendent experiences countless people have had throughout history that a vast intelligence exists that at times can be directly experienced. Even Sir Arthur Eddington, the astrophysicist who proved that Einstein's space-time curvature was correct, wrote about realms beyond the physical in his SCIENCE AND THE UNSEEN WORLD. Interestingly such \"spiritual\" notions as other realms is consistent with the other dimensions of M-theory. The point is that the fine-tuning of our Universe could be simply the result of being part of a purposeless multiverse --  I acknowledge that -- or it could be the result of an intelligence whose purpose was a life-friendly Universe and whose thoughts were the cause of the Big Bang and the just right laws of nature. This has nothing to do with biblical creationism or intelligent design. In fact, Darwinian evolution would be an essential component in this interpretation of the origin of the Universe. The Dalai Lama wrote that when hard scientific evidence contradicts spiritual beliefs, science should win out. But it is equally fair to ask that science not reject out of hand the evidence from fine-tuning that the Universe may turn out to be more than an accident."

I hope so, but I have the feeling that we'd find some manner to marginalize Feynman, make the world feel that his contributions were substandard, and relegate him to the backs of napkins at Starbuck's.

Anyone who can follow their closing paragraphs on the relation between negative gravitational energy and the creation of the universe probably knows it all already. This is physics by sound-bite.\"  Further, \"It is the bare bones of quantum mechanics that have proved to be consistent with what is presently known of the subatomic world. The authors' interpretations and extrapolations of it have not been subjected to any decisive tests, and it is not clear that they ever could be.\""

                "Text": "This book should really have been titled \"The ILLUSION of a Grand Design\", based on the authors' overt attempts at defending their atheistic beliefs.  It has always struck me how some scientists have the arrogance to think that somehow their science can explain away God, when God, by definition transcends science (any definition of God involvng particle physics and quantum fields wouldn't be God in most people's book).  And then to have the arrogance to say, as these authors do, that \"philosophy is dead\".  Let's think about what that means:  all discussions about personal meaning, fullfillment, justice, purpose, good and evil, etc, are pointless?  In other words, all that really matters is what the authors consider to be a pointless, Godless, universe?  Does this give Hawking solace in his physical suffering?  I am not saying I want him (or me) to believe in a God just because it makes him feel better.  The fact is nobody really knows if there is a God or not, although some people are awefully convinced of it based on personal experience.  I am just saying no person, speaking as a scientist, can flat out say there is no god, because, as I mentioned, the notion of God transcends science.  I am a scientist, and huge proponent of the scientific method, but science just explains particles and fields at its most basic level.  It can not explain how consciousness (or \"spirit\" if you like) arises from inert chemicals.  It also can not explain a lot of other things, like why there is something rather than nothing, and why \"this\" something.  It can't even explain why the universe is accelerating in its expansion or what it's ultimate fate will be.  In fact, theoretical physics hasn't been able to explain a whole lot in the last 15 or so years.  String theory has the potential, we're told, to provide a quantum theory of gravity.  But what physical constants have ever been derived from string theory?  And what's interesting in this book is that prominent physicists like Hawking now finally admit that there probably is no single, unifying theory of physics... just a \"family\" of theories that only work well in their own realm or other slightly overlapping realms.  What kind of theory is that, except for an approximate one... and if it's approximate is it really a theory?  If we said mass/energy is approximately conserved, would that be a theory?  Also in this book the authors seem to continually trip over their own semantics and double-talk, making statements like \"there is no definitive, observer independent past\", but go on to talk about the 13.7 billion years of universal evolution since the big bang as if it's as real as Lincoln's Assassination.  I think physicists are having a tough time letting go of there materialistic heritage in light of quantum discoveries that are showing the universe out there is really more like a state of 'potentia', only to become as real as real can be in the human mind, or a collection of human minds."

Stephen Hawking's claim that the universe creation does not require intervention of God strikes my interest instantly.  But after reading the book he fell way short of giving a compelling explanation of that theory and the first 7 chapters of the book (over 80% of the book) is just explanation of modern science theories that we already know.  Sadly, after reading this book my perception of Stephen Hawking is somewhat diminished.  I used to thought that he's the most genius physicist, now I think he's a genius physicist among many who happen to crave attention."

                "Text": "The pans on this website are fair.  The cosmic claims made are threadbare, lacking in evidentiary support.  Why are universes self-generating?  The authors don't meaningfully attempt to answer the question, which lies at the heart of their premise:  That we live in one of billions of universes, the one whose physical laws are capable of supporting matter and life.  But let's stipulate that this apparently speculative premise is nevertheless correct.  My theological question is, so what?  The authors concede readily that the likelihood of any one universe being able to support matter and life is exceedingly small -- because the laws of physics are so precisely fine-tuned.  From there, they leap to the conclusion that there is no need for a God to explain the existence of our universe, the one in which we happen to find ourselves, because, again, it is just one among billions of universes.  But what's theoretical bridge connecting these two principles?  I don't see it -- and I am a person whose faith is far from rock solid.  Can't someone respond to Hawking by saying, \"You say we're lucky to live in our universe (because it's one of the few that can support life), but why can't that \"luck\" be something pre-ordained, or at least caused, by a creator, a God?  Someone who wins the lotto, beating the odds, might naturally attribute his good fortune to God's will.  Why me?  Why was I so lucky?  What force intervened to give me such a bounty?  Hawking's book does nothing to undermine this person's likely assumption that God played a significant role in his hitting the jackpot."

On the other hand, it wasn't complicated, and he got into the history of things--where this theory and that theory came from, had he not done that, the book would have only been sixty-pages; that part was somewhat old, but still interesting, yet where the design was that threw God out of the picture, I lost it.  Here I was looking for the death of God, and found God made more than one Universe, by gosh, he created a larger supreme being than I had ever imagined. Where this proof is, he never really tells you, he kind of goes around in circles, drops a few concepts, theories, ones we all kind of know or heard about, but leaves it up to us to believe that his end predict will do what he says it will do: eliminate God; and here I'm trying to connect gravity and Electromagnetism,  and a weak nuclear force, and a strong nuclear force, and so forth and connect all these dots, and were are we after I turn the last page, back to where we started; he does  put an alien here and there gives some science fiction writers some data to use on their next short stories in mathematics and quantum theories, but God is still alive.  The Design of his new universe is somewhat there, and the ones behind ours and all those other ones, that he just briefly mentions are out there, we have to take him at his word, it's called faith, in that he knows what he's talking about; so,  as these universes expand, they kind of recreate themselves, like the aliens are trying to do by snatching  humanity's women and trying to clone themselves (this is of course my interpretation of his cloning process for the universes out there we never knew we had, but with his theory).  I'm just going on and on because I wanted to read something concrete for once in a science book that doses what the author says it is suppose to do; he does draw his support from folks like Sagan and Darwin, but they've not proven anything concrete either; he kind of downgrades Einstein for accepting God as the sum of all things, and gives him credit for starting the ball rolling but I get the impression, he thinks he's wiser than Einstein (who's to say?).  Anyhow, I read his Black Hole book, again a theory, but better than this one.  DLS"

However, what I got was just the old information which you can find in the previous books of Mr. Hawking and other books about Quantum Theories. Only the last chapter of the book you may find some insights about the arugument of the self functioning (without God's interfere and manipulation) nature of the universes. Besides, readers who also read the books about ancient Buddhism (e.g. Heart Sutra, What the Buddha Taught etc. ) may wonder the description of nothing, the laws of universes, the meaning of life and death, no soul theory, the non-existence of God, are in great similarities with the claims of the authors and modern quantum physics.

It is human nature to fear death and those that cannot handle that thought flock together to believe there is a life after death.

                "Text": "In Hawking's and Mlodinow's pop-science book \"The Grand Design\" it is an attempt to explain how the universe began, why we are here, etc. It is written on the high school level. Instead of concentrating on classical versus quantum physics and cosmology they spend far to much time trying to disprove the existence of God,using the above mentioned disciplines, which I might add, was done in a very sloppy and inaccurate manner. It is very evident that these physicists have had no training in theology whatsoever or have not researched sources involving \"science versus religion\". The big picture their missing is science is based on the \"scientific method\" whereas religion is based on faith. The religious scriptures are clearly not to be science textbooks;the scientific events listed,in these religious writings,are simply how the people of the time explained their world at that point in time. There are far more valuable lessons to be learned from these religious writings (i.e Bible and or Koran) then looking for statements that science has proven wrong. Let's leave classical and quantum physics to the physicist and religion to the theologians. There are far better books out their that discuss \"science and religion\" as well as the relationship involving classical physics and quantum mechanics. Don't waste your time checking it out let alone buying it. Total waste of money. A fast food meal would be money better spent."

In that philosophy a logical groundwork is laid out and the necessity of a creator is not required to explain the universe. So when Stephen Hawking says \"It is not necessary to invoke God . . . [to] set the universe going\" he is echoing the same investigation which was done long time back. Samkhya has no official position on God unlike the nastika (atheistic) philosophies like Buddhism or Jainism. In the end after investigation..\"what remains..is what remains\" And that is pure awareness."

Yet, many the theories they present have to be taken on faith. A major premise of the authors' is that the universe we see if one of many. Even though that may be mathematically possible in his equations, there is no way it can ever be proven. In other words, we have to take it on faith. I'm sorry but I already have a faith, and I prefer mine over the authors' imaginings. Watch them come up with another even better `theory' once the sales of this book fall."

What Hawking fails to explore, is the truth that Einstein in fact concluded that God must exist and in fact created life.  For out of nothingness comes the same.  Nothing.  Name something in creation that did not have an origin.  The answer is...nothing.  Thus any sensible person can only conclude that Hawking, despite being incredibly intelligent, is also, a fool."

People playing with mathematical formulas writing philosophical books trying to refute philosophy have a god hating/ atheistic agenda up their sleeve. I love Newton; the man had a brain for natural science and a humble heart and reference for the God of the Bible. The intelligent atheist really makes a fool of himself trying to refute the God of the Bible for it's as the bible states in Proverbs 22:30, There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord. These atheists are up against God and that's why they are contradicting themselves without knowing it. For a refutation of `The Big Bang theory' read John Hartnett's book, `Dismantling the big bang'."
