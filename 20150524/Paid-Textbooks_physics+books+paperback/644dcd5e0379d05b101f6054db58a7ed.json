                "Text": "With a PhD in particle physics and the easily digestible writing style, shared by his contemporaries Jon Krakauer and Nick Hornby, Simon Singh delivers once again. Having read and found \"Fermat's Enigma\" to be a thoroughly enjoyable and well researched book into the history of a seemingly simple equation (get that one too), I eagerly awaited the publication of this book. It makes for an excellent introduction into the world of cosmology. Singh relates the history of the subject from the early thinkers through to the current state of play - everyone from the \"Cosmology Hall of Fame\" is given a spot for their thoughts to be elucidated, how they affected the theories, how the modern folks are building on that knowledge, what questions remain unanswered, and what new questions are being promulgated. This is a worthy addition to the armchair and professional astronomer alike...worthy of a place alongside books by Hawking, Rees, Weinberg, Smoot and Gribben."

                "Text": "Simon Singh arranges the historical development of the big bang theory in a superb way drawing in ancient elements such as the Greek philosphers and atronomers right up to the recent data obtained by the COBE satellite. The big bang theory is a very unique one in that it predicts the method by which it can be verified or dismissed. Should the theory be correct then there should remain a residual background radiation and if this weak background radiation can be detected it would surely add indisputable evidence that the universe did indeed originate with one very BIG BANG! The chapters are very easy to read and only include mathematical equations when appropriate. Suprisingly, there is very little citation and referencing of comments and therefore sourcing the original material is not possible.The story of the big bang theory can be used to highlight how science works and develops and indeed how paradigm shifts can occur in science."

The book is highly entertaining as Singh describes the personalities and theories of astronomy, atoms, and the Big Bang.  This is as good as science writing gets.  If you enjoy this book, read his other books on Fermat's last theorem and The Code Book.  They are also excellent.  I can't wait for his next endeavor."

                "Text": "Once again Simon Singh blew me away with his ability to explain a complex and difficult subject in an understandable and honest way.  Too many popular science books either oversimply to the point where obvious questions are ignored or are fuzzy about so many details that the book becomes hard to understand.  For me, Simon Singh is one of the few who can present a believable picture that's consistent and understandable.  I came in trusting Singh since I know something about number theory and was impressed with the mathematically honest presentation in 'Fermat's Enigma'.  Before reading his latest book, I knew next to nothing about the big bang or cosmology.  I finished the book feeling like I had a fairly good high-level understanding of the subject.  He presents a series of discoveries and shows how the big bang is derived from some and predicts others.  He's honest about areas where there's still disagreement or a lack of information.  He puts in just enough human interest to keep the story line interesting (this isn't a textbook, after all) without putting in so much that it stops seeming like a science book.  I wish more people could write like Singh."

Enter Simon Singh who does what few writers are able to do in informing the math and science illiterate --i.e., make the subject matter both accessable and interesting.  Had I been exposed at a younger age to the science history and theory Singh provides the reader in the Big Bang (as well as in his two other books, Fermat's Enigma and The Code Book), I am certain I would have been far less intimidated, much more inquisitive and, inevitably, better informed about the wonder and magnificence of the world and universe in which we are privileged to live. Thanks to Simon Singh, I look to the heavens with a new sense of fascination, understanding and wonder."

I had gathered small tidbits of information about astronomy through other books, documentaries, news articles etc due to my interest in the subject matter. However, no other source I had used in the past gave me a clear sequence of discoveries which led us to the current, widely accepted 'Big Bang' model of the origin of the universe. This book provides a concise sequence of discoveries leading to the success of the Big Bang Theory, without losing logical flow. In addition to scientific information, the writer also provides small interesting stories about the scientists involved, making reading the book an enjoyable journey through the history of the development of our understanding of the nature of the universe. I thought the explanation of scientific concepts was very easy to understand with the illustrations provided in the book. However, my opinion maybe a little biased since I do have a Sci/Tech background, albeit in a completely different area. Finally, the two page summaries at the end of each chapter, are a great way to recap the events discussed at length in the chapter. I would highly recommend this book to anybody with an interest in learning about our current understanding about the origin of the universe."

In essence, it's a history book on how mankind has discovered the secrets of the universe over the course of 2500 years through a series of postulating theories and then proving (or disproving) those theories with evidence and rational observation, using whatever technology exists at the time.  Until recently I had not given the Big Bang theory much thought, and wanted to read a book about the evidence that brought about the theory.  This book did not disappoint.  For the most part, the astrophysics and cosmology is presented in a way that the lay person can understand.  I have an engineering degree, and as I read this book I would ask myself if a non-technical person could understand the concept being presented.  Usually, the answer was yes, and for the times the answer was no, I thought the non-technical person could get the overall point without full understanding the physics, chemistry or trigonometry.  I also enjoyed the background of the discoveries, and how personal, political and religious forces had an affect on the advancement of cosmic knowledge.  Two thumbs up!"

At the end of each chapter he provides an excellent synopsis of the state of affairs in clear hand-written notes.  Above all, Singh shows how the Big Bang Theory emerged through the application of the scientific method, by relying on investigation, empirical analysis, and scrutiny from leading cosmologists and scientists.  Singh also addresses the even larger questions involved in this subject, and includes thoughts of other scientific giants, like Carl Sagan, who says that we may now understand that the Big Bang happened, but why it happened is the greatest mystery we know."

Cosmology has always been an interest of mine, so this was right up my alley. However, I think even if it wasn't, I would have still loved it. He makes complicated topics easy to understand without sacrificing any details. From the ancient religious views concerning the universe to the creation and development of the Big Bang model, this book covers it all. The knowledge I've gained has come into play a surprising number of times, and people are amazed that I know so much about the universe. I HIGHLY recommend this book for ANYONE. Even if you are religious, this book even mentions where religion could or could not fit in, thus not trying to disprove what you believe. I didn't think it could be done, but this book is even better than the Code Book."

In addition to the wealth of knowledge in this book, this ranks among the most fluid and pleasing writing I've ever read--and not just in the technical realm.  If Mr. Singh is this gifted intellectually AND he has this incredible gift of writing, well, that's just not fair!  It was a pleasure reading this book.  I thought is was a wonderful overview of the big bang theory and the mysteries of the origin of the universe.  It was also nice to read an author who does not have a vendetta against those who believe a higher power is a possibility, an avenue I believe we should leave open when we take into account the enigma of the birth of the universe and the quantum world.  Great, great book!"

I love how Singh starts with the first forays into the scientific method and slowly progresses his way from the first attempts to understand the universe to the Greeks' ability to calculate the circumference of the Earth to how that little bit of knowledge led through various steps (and many mis-steps) to the current theory of the Big Bang.  This book is very readable, especially to non-technical people.  He includes many diagrams and pictures to illustrate certain points.  The text is cogent and concise.  Love this book!"

The author does this is such compelling language and with such ease that it's hard to remember this is a physics book.

Their knowledge of the area is usually so great that they are unable to reduce the complexity of the subject to that suitable for mere mortals. But Simon Singh with a PhD in particle physics is not one of them.  I noted that he had been a producer for the BBC so I felt that there was a chance that he could tell an understandable story. And I was right. This was one of the best science non-fiction books I've read in a long time. Singh walks us through the chronology of the development of the theory, starting with the earliest physicist/astronomers. He gives examples of objections to the Big Bang theory and then shows how the data supports the theory. One of the objections to the theory was that if the theory were true, then there should be background microwave radiation. And he proceeds to tell the story of how this radiation was finally found. Singh also discusses some of the personalities involved in the development from or fight against the theory. All-in-all this was a very worthwhile read, far superior in interest and anecdotes than books like The Elegant Universe or the Physics of the Buffyverse."
