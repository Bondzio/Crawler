                "Text": "I used this textbook as part of a College Algebra Based 2-Semester (4hr/4hr) sequence.  I had never taken Physics in high school due to taking a different science for my final one in high school, so I went in there with not much to work with.  Having said that though, this book is amazing, it has clear cut examples, formulas and descriptions and 100+ problems in every chapter to get plenty of practice.  The online homework supplement however is horrid, but the book itself is great."
