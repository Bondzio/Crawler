                "Text": "The second edition of this book has more of everything in it! The solutions to all of the homework in the 4th edition of \"Introduction to Health Physics\" are given in a step by step manner that is easy to follow. Plus, I discovered that there are many problems solved using two or sometimes three different methods. This book is a great reference for health physicists or anyone studying for the CHP exam. The one problem that persists is that occasionally some answers are different from the values given in the back of the textbook, usually by a decimal, but it is only a minor annoyance. Overall a great book and CHEAP!"

I would highly recommend this book to anyone taking this course."
