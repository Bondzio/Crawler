                "Text": "Amazing collection of whiny reviews. This text is one of only two CLASSIC introductory college physics textbooks, towering above all the others and deserving of that characterization, the other being the textbook by Haliday and Resnick. Young (and Freedman) simply carry on the tradition of this amazing text begun by the original authors more than fifty years ago, now dead, Sears and Zemansky. Generations of serious physicists began their college training with one or the other of these great textbooks. So if there are too many words and you want the picture book version of physics, change your major and get over it. Physics is hard and not for you. BTW using this textbook my students regularly get 4s and 5s on the AP Physics C exam."

                "Text": "I was fortunate to have two copies of the precursor to this book for physics - sixth and seventh versions I think. Some of the physics department staff at my university didn't like this book because they thought that it \"was too easy\". I consider Feynman's lectures the near perfect embodiment of physics lecture as a narrative, but I have to say that two volumes of Sears, Zemansky and Young comprised a great book and reference as well with many worked examples. The criticism was that other texts had harder problems - problems that often involved incorporating mathematical insights that did not immediately support the problem except to demonstrate that life sometimes makes solving problems difficult. Putting things at odd angles or offset coordinate to intentional produced difficult answers really isn't a help to comprehension. If your goal is to teach a concept, make it understandable so that the visual component is real. Complicating the world with mathematical convolutions at the expense of the initial appreciation and visualization of the principle is not a good tradeoff.  BTW , \"University Physics\", Sears and Zemansky, minus Young, seems to have been discontinued in the 13th edition.  Too bad.  You are lucky to have this book.  It is a competent piece."
