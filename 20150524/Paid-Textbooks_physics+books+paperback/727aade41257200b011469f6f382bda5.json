                "Text": "I've only been using this book for a day and have already been plagued by typos and errors. For example: page 57, the books states that 56,000x0.05 is 2300. Anyone who has a calculator can confirm that the correct answer is 2800. There was also a worked out solution on page 55 which misses a variable T in the explanation. I spent a solid amount of time trying to figure out how they solved that problem before I realized it was a typo. It makes for a very frustrating studying experience when you are trying to figure out what your study material did wrong in solving the problem instead of trying to figure out what you did wrong in solving the problem."

                "Text": "This is good for brushing up on/as a supplement for calculus-based physics.  Yes, there are errors scattered about, but most are overt and therefore readily seen.  I think this has actually helped in the study process, as we should be aware that there are errors in real life.  If the data doesn't seem right (like a nitrogen molecule moving through the air at 500m/s -- huh?) and my answer doesn't jive with the book's answer, but does when the molecule is moving at 0.500m/s(much more reasonable), the obvious data error is confirmed.  Sometimes the book answers are wrong with the given data, but most are apparent and makes for good real-life practice in dealing with errors. I guess the key to really put the book to its best use is to look forward to the errors and fix them.  I tend to think that maybe the errors were put in on purpose to help the student learn more.  At least it has in my case."
