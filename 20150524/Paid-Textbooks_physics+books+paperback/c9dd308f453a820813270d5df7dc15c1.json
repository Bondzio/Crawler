While the explainations are good, it only gives the explainations for a few choice problems, and those problems are the easy ones that you don't need help with. If you're looking for an answer key to help you figure out how to work out various settings this is not the right book. DO NOT BUY IT."

If you have no instruction on how the physics works, it is more than a little frustrating because the solution manual does NOT provide answers for every odd question. It picks one question out of each section and answers it. That was annoying. Like I said as far as a physics book goes, it is ok, but without outside resources such as a teacher haha, it will take a great deal of time and work. The condition of the book itself though was excellent, and there were no problems in recieving it."

Most solutions manuals show full solutions for odd numbered problems, but not this book, they only have random answers to odd numbered questions, so maybe only every 5th odd-numbered question will have an answer in this book.  This is not worth what you have to pay for it."
