And as a clarification, it even explicitly stated that there were no markings, highlighting, or any writing inside. To say the least, the company lied. There is writing inside the book. Lots of it. Not just in pencil, which will be an absolute pain to get rid of so I can use it, but there is also writing in pen and crayon. Being that this is a book for college, the seller has to understand the importance in a student like myself trying to save some money... not only that, but to at least give the buyer a chance to know what it is they're paying for by at least not advertising something to the TOTAL contrary. I've been buying my college books online for the past 2 years, and this purchase was, by far, the MOST DISAPPOINTING."
