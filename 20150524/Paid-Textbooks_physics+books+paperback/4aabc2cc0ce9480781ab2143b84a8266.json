And just plain interesting as hell. That's Sean Carroll's greatest achievement in this page-turner about the TIME we live in. If you have any interest at all in getting your head around just what this elusive \"time\" we all experience is all about, you should read this book."

Now, I am not going to tell you that after reading it you will be qualified to discuss either time or quantum mechanics but I will tell you that you will have a basic understanding of the complex nature of our world.  I took Physics 1 two times in college (and got a B the second time around) so I am not the greatest student of quantum physics.  But I found this book very worth buying and reading.  You (like me) may have to read a handful of pages at a time to digest the whole thing but it is easy to do. The organization of the material makes it very easy to stop and start where you want. And if you do read it, don't pass up the footnotes. Read each one as though they are spices sprinkled over a fine dish.  They add so much meaning and understanding to the discussion.  If you have any interest in why there is an \"arrow of time,\" get this book and read it, a time or two.  I really did not know that quantum mechanics could be so interesting!"

                "Text": "I purchased this book after watching a series of shows on NOVA covering the topic. The book gives an excellent overview for the theory of time, however for me it was a little difficult to follow. I've read in some of the other reviews that a layman would have absolutely no problem understanding all of the ideas put forth in the book, but even so it wasn't a case where everything was perfectly clear to me. I have no background in science, just an interest in the theory of time and the possibilities of time travel. I'm giving this book 4 stars because it's not the authors fault that I couldn't understand all of the concepts presented. I would love to be able to find another book which explains in really easy to understand language if time travel will ever become a reality, and the obstacles of going back in time or forward to the future."

At least until I read Professor Carroll's From Eternity to Here. The text and the ideas presented are very accessible, and I found myself nodding \"yes\" to the topical discussions and growth of the discussion of entropy from thermo to black holes. For me the discussion unified many past theories I have learned, and brought in some new ideas that I want to study. I still don't know why we have the arrow of time, but it is time for me at least to go back to school."

                "Text": "Working in computer science I've always been fascinated by the concept of information, entropy, complexity, reversibility and how they are intertwined with physics and time (yes I know, it's the other way round, but I'm a computer scientist). Carroll talks about these and takes care to present in a non-technical and fair way a LOT of ideas (he has his favorites, but refrains from championing them from the start) and speculation about the nature of time and why it goes in one direction and not the other, Particularly liked a lot his discussion of  Boltzmann's ideas on entropy and the universe. Carroll also states clearly what is speculation and what is accepted fact within the physics cosmology community. His implicit assumption through most of the book is that the laws of physics are fundamentally deterministic and time symmetric, an issue that he addresses directly towards the end of the book, and that influences his cosmological outlook. Carroll doesn't say names but he clearly does not buy Hawking's interpretation that space time itself started with the big bang (Hawking-Hartle no boundary universe), and his justification for the need of a model that should go beyond that is quite convincing. It is a long read, and 3/4 through the book, as most physics books without formulas are, it can get a bit ethereal, but it's a satisfying read, quite philosophical and inspiring, and when you get to the end you'll appreciate the elegance and the reasons behind the model of the universe that he is seeking."

Frankly this book is a huge disappointment.  It is overloaded with wanderings through science history citing off-the-point facts and figures that can already be found in countless other volumes and sources.  It gave me the definite impression that Mr. Carroll had a panel of graduate students write this book for him- or at least most of the chapters. It is that off-focus.  It never gets to the point. And whether it reminds you of your ex-wife or not, it does keep repeating the same concepts long after the horse is dead. Okay, we got the bit about entropy. There are no original ideas in this book. It introduces no new theories, and draws no interesting conclusions. The only salient concept is that time moves in one direction because entropy moves in one direction.  Unless you are completely ignorant about basic science and cosmology you will find this book to be the same as I did - a waste of time (and money).  Sean Carroll please don't waste your time writing books that go nowhere and say nothing new."

On the other hand, you get cheap pop books that are more focused with shiny theories and predictions that are at the peripheral of the science community. Fortunately, From Eternity to Here falls into the first group. Sean Carroll sets off to discuss the current theories of why time only flows in one direction. That is pretty heady stuff and can get really complex. Carroll does a good job explaining some of the science in an understandable way, but he does not cut corners when he does not need to. Because of that, From Eternity to Here has pretty lengthy discussions of the law of entropy and general relativity. These discussions do not rely so much on the flashy predictions that seems to populate a lot of science books, but rather involve the nuts and bolts of these theories, even going so far as to get into the mathematics. I enjoyed this approach, because I felt that Carroll was focusing on the actually science and not just trying to write what would appeal to mass audiences. Carroll\u2019s approach made this book interesting, especially to somebody like me who is studying physics in college. I would highly recommend From Eternity to Here to people who have some background in physics"

Even if you have read elsewhere, I'd still recommend it highly.  Many of the ideas I read about in FETH I'd read about elsewhere, but nowhere as thoroughly or cogently developed as they are in this fine book.  There are so many things I only half-understood before working through them here.  And so many connections among ideas that I only encountered for the first time as I read this book.  As popular science goes, FETH is not an easy read.  But the rewards it pays out to the patient and persistent reader well match any challenges they entail.  Of course, no popular treatment of physical/cosmological concepts can truly close understanding gaps that require years of scientific training and a talent for higher math.  But reading FETH brought me about as close as I can imagine getting to a genuine grasp of the ideas that are at stake in this endlessly fascinating realm of inquiry.  Cosmology/physics/metaphysics/philosophy buffs: have at!"

In order to answer that question Carroll takes us on an odyssey across space/time to first come to terms with what is meant by entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, black hole physics, and big bang cosmology.  The explanations were very clear but at the same time thought provoking and challenging.  This is a book that really gets you to think about deep questions that most of us usually take for granted.  Could there actually be a plausible explanation for how the universe came to be?  Why should the entropy of the universe have been so low at the begining?  Science is begining to find good answers to these difficult questions.  Always grounded in actual physics, Carroll is careful to make us aware when the discussion moves from proven theory into science-based speculation.  A must read for anyone interested in a serious discussion of the origin of the universe and what might have come before the big bang."

The book was more about the various definitions of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics which states that The total entropy of a closed system increases in time, which is the main reason for the unidirectionality of time. It explored multiple definitions of entropy and how they effect theories of cosmology.  It was very up to date and well written. I wouldn't recommend it for your first book on modern physics. It assumes that you have a reasonable understanding of modern physics already. It also has some math but nothing too difficult. This book is cutting edge. I have read other books by Sean Carroll and find him to be an excellent writer with a good understanding of modern physics and cosmology. No other book that I have read has done such a detailed treatment of entropy which is a very difficult topic."

I took this book for what it was worth to me after I gave up, too boring, trying to read it cover to cover. I skimmed it, what a waste of money, to find anything that I was interested in. I agree with the reviewer who gave this book one star, his complaint was that the author says the same thing over and over again, he's right, and also right about the book being way too long, God where are the editors these days? But my main criticism of this author is that he can't write. Too many odd sentence constructions, odd ways of using words, unnecessary words and phrases, stilted, hard to read sentences. All this could be improved by editing for clarity, ease and flow of narrative, and conciseness, most of which this book lacks. This fellow may be a physicist, maybe even a very good one, but a good writer he's not."

This book could easily have been one-third it's size.  To summarize this book: time=entropy.  That's all you need to know.  Now find something worth reading.  I could go on but then my review would be as self serving as the book."

                "Text": "Please note that I have already submitted to you one written review of Carroll's \"From Eternity to Here\", and can't guarantee that this will be exactly the same but, as I said previously, this is a \"must\" read for all amateur cosmologists. Not since Hawking's \"A Brief History of Time\", have I had to go back and reread entire chapters just so that I was sure I understood what Carroll was saying. He greatly enhanced my appreciation for the vastness of our visible universe, and what may lie beyond it that we can never observe. He challenges numerous traditional notions of time and space in a way that really forces the reader to think. An invaluable addition to any amateur scientist's library."
