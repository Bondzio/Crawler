                "Text": "I am a first year graduate student in physics and have just recently gotten interested in classical perturbation methods.  I have read the text and have found it to be a very nice, straightforward read.  Series expansions to the roots of polynomials are covered and various techniques for solving differential equations are also introduced.  It is a great book and I highly recommend it!  The title accurately describes the text however: the book provides only a first look at these topics.  It is a great book for those like me who would like to get an idea about what perturbation theory is good for, but it is not appropriate for those looking for a thorough text."
