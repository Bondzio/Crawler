                "Text": "I had a copy of this text while an undergrad a number of years ago.  Found it useful to at the time compliment more of the mainstream texts, since the approach is somewhat Russian flavored.  In getting a new copy, which is essentially a slightly revised from the original version, it's served as a nice compliment and a refresher for different ways to consider problem solution alternatives.  Regarding Kompanayet's take on all the theories, he emphasizes the usuals: Mechanics, E&M;, and QM, not necessarily the most current way of presenting, yet useful in filling in concepts that may no longer get attention.  He finishes with a reasonably good coverage of Statiistical Physics, which may or may not be as common today as when he first published.  Overall, his book provides a nice reference work for any working physicist's toolkit."
