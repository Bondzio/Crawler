                "Text": "First of all, I'm not sure how fair my review actually is. I've read the book \"A Short History of Almost Everything\" and LOVED IT; it was very easy to understand and entertaining. I thought the same would be true with \"The Theory of Almost Everything,\" not so. This book is for individuals who already possess a working knowledge of Physics. It is well written and uses some common everyday analogies but the basic fact remains, if you don't understand general Physics; structure of atoms and molecules, the periodic table or special relativity, you are going to have problems comprehending the material presented in this book. The book is well written and I applaud Mr. Robert Oerter for his efforts. I only wish I had the cognitive ability to take advantage of his work. For those of you who do have a basic understanding of Physics, enjoy!"

                "Text": "The Theory Of Almost Everything: The Standard Model describes all known physical interactions, with the exception of gravity: outside of scientific circles it receives half the attention of the chaos theory or string theory - but it's more important than either, and any with an interest in physics needs to understand \"The Standard Model\" to know where we're going. It blends Einstein's special relativity with quantum mechanics - and Oerter explores the theory and how it agrees with experiments. From its basic foundations to how new developments could alter its concepts, physics teacher Robert Oerter provides solid information."

                "Text": "This book is not written for lay people with little knowledge of physics, don't believe these other reviews, you'll not understand it. I have training in physics and I can't understand some of the concepts in this book. It is a good review of key developments in particle physics of the last century however, and if this is your aim then get this book, it'll introduce you to all the major theories and people behind it. The examples used in the book to illustrate difficult concepts are not that great, quite often complicated theories are presented point blank as if the readers are veteran physicists themselves, many times the author writes as if he's having a dialogue to himself, with nobody around who could understand what he's talking about unless you look at other references. I do not know why others give it such a good review, I certainly don't expect this book can turn anyone into a particle physics expert, but in trying to explain difficult concepts to lay people and ending up not explaining it well enough, or sometimes not explaining it at all, this book has lost some of it's main purpose."

I read 2 other books, and they left me unsatisfied - more focused on the people or the quest or whatever. This is the one I was looking for. I think Mr. Oerter does a great job. Newton changed our ancestors' world, and E = Mc2 has been the sexiest scientific formula since before computers. The Standard Model has got to be the un-sexiest name any of these physicists could come up with, and it comes with a complete lack of pithy formulas with which we can impress our friends. Apparently for those reasons this huge advancement in our understanding hasn't been in the public's attention. If you are interested in science but don't happen to be a physicist, read this book."
