                "Text": "Consciousness and the mind have long been ignored by science and left to philosophy to ponder, but Walker makes a brilliant break through with what he has to say in this book.  By taking the fundamental problems with Quantum theory and approaching them with a fresh and open mind, this book  presents some very amazing and exciting possibilities into the real  workings of reality.  While heavy in Quantum theory, Walker does a  sufficent job of moving the reader through a long and complicated journey,  the rewards of which are quite worth the work.  I highly recommend this  book to anyone searching for answers to life's bigger questions who can no  longer believe through faith alone."

                "Text": "I was given this book by a friend several years ago, along with another book on quantum physics.  This book stood out because of the approach Walker took to presenting his material.  I had many insights into quantum physics as it relates to my own life while reading this book (three times so far), but the gem of the book in my opinion is contained in the appendix.  I come back to Walker's insights into consciousness as presented in the last part of the book, and in the appendix many times to refresh my understanding of how quantum physics applies to my daily experience in life.  This is particularly interesting when looking at how events affect my consciousness, and has given me insight into how to apply quantum physics in my daily life.  Outstanding book to read, but if you have only a passing interest in quantum physics, you may want to prepare yourself to take more of an interest in the subject, as this book will be much more rewarding if you do."

                "Text": "This is an excellent book for those who are interested in both  physics and the meditative arts. Meditation is inwardly focused, and self directed. This book attempts to provide a quantum physics perspective on what is actually taking place within the body during the normal living process. The first 60% to 70% of the book reviews the physics. This material is accessible to non-physicists and is essential background to the understanding of the latter part of the book, which focuses on consciousness and the mind. The challenge for some readers, who may be primarily interested in the meditative arts, is to stay with the physics in the first part of the book. Those who do will be rewarded with further insight , unlikely to  be attained through meditative practices alone. This is the first book that I have discovered that attempted to provide scientific evidence on the physical location of the mind, and how the mind operates. Unfortunately, the current state of knowledge in quantum physics does not provide a complete, definitive theory of the mind and conciousness. This book provides insight into these  subjects, and  will definitely add perspective to the practice of meditative arts; but it is not yet able to tell the full story. Nevertheless, it is an excellent read and has added to my knowledge base in both these subject matter areas."

This is not simply the exposition of another theory. It represents a lifetime of research and total dedication to find answers to the burning human questions: What is Reality? Why am I here? What happens when I die? Walker exibits the human ability for thorough, methodical, and magnificently detailed analysis of physical theories at its best. This is not only a book to be read as another book on physics. It's a book  one can live by."

The effect of consciousness on the material universe is put forward. Walker takes different interpretations of quantum physics paradoxes and selects those that can fit consciousness into the equations and enlighten us."

                "Text": "The criteria for rating a popular presentation of science must be: 1) Did the author clearly state his theory at the outset? 2)Did he present a logical argument based on facts to support his ideas? 3) Did he come to a conclusion that followed logically from his argument 3) Was the style engaging?  Measured by these standards, this book rates a five.  We must remember that Walker alerted us from the beginning that this was a preliminary study to show that the quantum interface between the mind (consciousness) and the body (materiality) indicates that mind is an entity in itself and not merely a consequence of chemical and electromagnetic forces at work to produce the \"illusion\" of consciousness as a separate entity.  He readily admits that his  conclusion that consciousness manifests through quantum processes in the brain is just a starting point for further investigation. At the end he trails off into a mystical view of reality that is more lyrical than factual. This has turned off some of the reviewers on Amazon. But Walker's thesis is, after all, an attempt to show \"The Quantum Mind and the Meaning of Life\" employing physics.  Walker concludes that the \"meaning\" of life is a function of the \"stuff\" of life.  Our immediate experience of reality is limited by the make-up of the brain. Mind transcends and supercedes the brain to intuit that there is more to reality than \"meets the eye.\" \"So we at last find that reality is the observer observing.  It is the two parts of our great separation coming together.  There is a separation.  There is a dreadful and vast separation.  But there is no space and really no matter to die but that our own minds did not first come together to create it.  Our observation- our coming together- created matter.  Observation itself is the stuff of the space that reaches out past the vast clusters of galaxies.  Reality is the fruit of love's embrace.\" (page 309.) The interwoven story of his memories of a lost love is the device that illustrates the consequences of his theory. It is a \"scientific\" confirmation of the esoteric knowledge that \"thoughts are things.\" Walker's reminiscences \"resurrect\" Merilyn in his consciousness.  She is not physically present on \"this plane,\" but then, our experience of this plane is itself illusory, or at least incomplete.  Only \"non-local\" consciousness is is the ultimate reality.  Thus, he and Merilyn are together in the \"eternal now.\""

                "Text": "What a wonderful read this was for the first 8 chapters. The amazing mysteries of quantum mechanics are well covered, if somewhat more deeply than necessary. What makes it unique though, is that it is interwoven with a concurrent story about a long-dead lover and the inherent questions that death entails. This made for some really gripping, moving reading. It's quite well written, and I was excited that the author seemed to be approaching the questions raised by quantum mechanics in exactly the same way that I had approached them myself. Then, in chapter 9, BAM - a left turn into Zen Buddhism. Not just a left turn into Zen Buddhism, which I understand has some well respected philosophical underpinnings, but a left turn into Zen Buddhism that presupposes that the reader, like the author, accepts that Zen is The Way To Enlightenment. Note this sentence at the beginning of chapter 9: \"It was not until recently that I found Zen Buddhism, timeless and sparkling, hidden amid its oriental foil.\" Timeless and sparkling? Says who? Buddhism, like all religion/philosophy, is the product of the mind of man, and if the reader is to look at it as anything more, the reader should come to it on his own, not have it thrust upon him as if it just simply were so. This whole chapter has this air of presupposition, as if the author realizes that his audience probably knew all this about Zen Buddhism long before he did, and he is now, at long last, agreeing with them. It was so distasteful to me I was unable to finish the book. What a shame. Perhaps I will skim through it at a later date so I can find out more about Meryl."
