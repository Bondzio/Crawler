                "Text": "I used this text book in my intro level physics course in college - physics for the rest of us.  What a fantastic - truly fantastic - and gifted author/teacher Griffith is.  This book explains seemingly complex subject matter on an intuitive level, using examples pulled right out of one's personal experience.  It's completely non-intimidating and worth every dime (and I paid $100 for it at the time!).  You will not be disappointed and you will learn the physics you were always needlessly afraid of."
