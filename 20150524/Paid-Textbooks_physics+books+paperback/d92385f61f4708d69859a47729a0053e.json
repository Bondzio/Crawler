                "Text": "Physics is not all about deriving and using the formulas.  The only way you will grasp physics is in a conceptual format.  he 1st 1/2 of this book is not helpful at all.  They have pages and pages on how to derive the formula w/out explaining the conceptual part.  Unless your professor specifically asks for the problems in this book, I wouldn't buy it.  You can find all the formulas on the net and how to solve them."

I had to hire a tutor and watch video's on the net about solving Physics problems to supplement the lack of explanation in this book. I wish I didn't have to use this book for my Physics class but it's required. I've learned much more off the you tube physics help video's than this book. I'm studying architecture and get all A's in every class. I consider myself smart but this book makes me feel dumb because it's so difficult to grasp the concepts. Don't like this book AT ALL. Would not recommend it. Waste of money!"
