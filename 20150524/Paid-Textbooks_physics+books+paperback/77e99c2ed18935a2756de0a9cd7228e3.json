                "Text": "In \"Physics of the Future,\" Michio Kaku provides us with glimpses of the near and long futures with a simplistic, perhaps overly simplistic, writing style.  It is, as is usual coming from the mind of a scientist, an extremely optimistic and glowing portrait of humanity's inevitable march of technological progress, with very little concern or thought put into the wild contradictions of modernity, how the forces of free market capitalism, democracy, environmental degradation, etc. will play out.  Scientists do not live in a bubble, and if the world is at war or swept up by revolution then science cannot function.  I think there's equal chance that humanity will be living in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse 100 years from now as it will be living in technological splendor."

Maby it was just me, but I already knew about a lot of the technologies he was talking about. however a fresh  explanation wouldnt have hurt, how it works and why, the explanations were extremely basic and almost written for someone who had  never heard of something like augmented reality or life extension before, you could find more interesting tidbits just by going to Wikipedia. There was not enough innovative thinking about the far far future, which is what I was expecting, any guesses were boring and bland and not at all indicative of how superbly innovative humanity can be.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the explanations on levels of civilizations, but I already had seen that on a discovery channel interview with him, which is what made me buy the book. Perhaps the book just wasnt for me."

With that being said, if it was written by anyone else, it would be a 5. The book is extremely interesting and for those of us with imaginations who really wonder what technologies will be around in 90 years, this is the definitive book. Well done Mr. Kaku."

                "Text": "Anyone familiar with Michio Kaku's television series \"Physics of the Impossible\", or the book for that matter, might find his recent material getting a little repetitive as far as what the future holds. I feel like this book pretty much details much of the material covered in \"Physics of the Impossible\", and his show on the Discovery Science channel of the same title. Don't get me wrong, the book would have been a complete success if it wasn't for the fact that we've sorta heard it all before from him. I really wish he would pick a new subject to cover in his next book, or at least give us something new to ponder about the future of technology and physics. I personally think Dr. Kaku, along with Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Brian Cox, Brian Greene and Lawrence Krauss are among the best communicators of modern physics that we have available today, Michio Kaku being the better of all in my opinion. I've been both a fan and a follower since the fist time I saw him speak in his simple, \"Carl Sagan like\" tone. I think he has a natural gift of relating otherwise uncomprehendable subjects to the masses in a way we can all understand, which is why I give this book 4 stars. It's a really good book that will certainly make you stop and think, and definately has that page turning quality. I just think it would be really hard for Dr. Kaku to match the quality of his ealier book \"Hyperspace\".. That was the book that opened my mind to physics and the magic of science. Sometimes, we humans tend to outdue our own selves and make it hard to match what preceded our earlier accomplishments. I will always be a fan, but surprise us with something completely unconventional for a change!!"

It seems to be talking about one idea in computer science, and then jumps to some kind of screen on a wall, instead of ideas of how silicon will eventually disappear.... etc. But I don't hate it near enough to put it down, because I want to have some sort of way of knowing what our world will look like in the future.

Michio Kaku not only provides the reader with substantial evidentiary support to his predictions of the future, but he does it in a fashion that enables individuals to share his personal experiences. For those of you who are fond of futuristic ideology, this book is highly recommended. Kaku provides interesting artistic depictions of futuristic commodities and simplistically describes the intricate physical laws of the universe, which enables readers of all scientific backgrounds to easily decipher the information provided. Essentially, what makes the book even more intriguing is how he includes interviews of over 200 scientists that all specialize in different fields. This enables the reader to have a broader perspective, while also being exposed to Kaku\u2019s complex understanding of physics and Moore\u2019s Law. I find his theories interesting on nanotechnology, artificial intelligence and the architectural reconstruction of the next millennium. In conclusion, his overall creative yet methodical approach to these intricate concepts makes this book all of the more pleasurable to read."

Renowned physicist Michio Kaku explains these predictions and many more in Physics of the Future. I am not surprised by Kaku's discussion of internet-ready contact lenses, nanotechnology or even the inevitable collapse of Moore's Law. His prognostications regarding robotics and space travel, on the other hand, are insightful as they strip away the hype created by popular culture and lay bare the stark reality. Although not a central theme, Kaku also argues the pivotal role of science and technology in world economic development and often alludes to a bright future for careers that involve a high level of pattern recognition such as artists, lawyers and software engineers. The book is split into 8 chapters, each following a similar structure that outline the near future, midcentury and far future potential of various technological advances. I found the repetition of this chapter structure tiresome and expect the book would be far more enjoyable if read in separate sittings."

                "Text": "Professor Kaku is generally regarded as the modern Einstein since he is he leading proponent of String Theory, the theory which attempts to produce \"The Theory of Everything\"  by linking up the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.  One would think a brain box like that could bore for America at the Olympics, but not Kaku.  He has a disarming way of explaining difficult concepts in a reachable and readable way that engages even those to whom mathematics is little more than a nightmare.  His predictions for the future of science in many fields are wonderfully reassuring and promise a bright future for a mankind that learns to use these technologies for the benefit of all.  I sometimes fell that he \"knows more than he is telling\" particularly in the area of trans-luminal flight and the application now of new energy sources, but since all research is funded by BigOil and BigPharma, University Boffins have to toe the line if they are not to choke off the source of their research money.  The Book is thoroughly enjoyable and must for anyone needing to know where we are going."

In his book, Kaku offers a deeply researched study of the technologies that will create society's future. He tackles everything from computer screens on contact lenses to magnetic levitation, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology. To keep his treatise reader-friendly, he brings in examples from Greek mythology, Star Trek and the Terminator movies. At times Kaku seems a bit too optimistic about the gee-whiz direction of the world, which he believes eventually will be free of cancer, car crashes and the ravages of aging. But he does temper some of his predictions: He points out the limits of stem cells and artificial intelligence, and he notes the dangers of global warming. getAbstract recommends his analysis to readers seeking an erudite but easy-to-digest survey of the innovations shaping the future."

In \"Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny & Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100\", he examines in depth what he believes will happen to everything in our world from medicine to computing to weather to space travel in the 21st century. What's unique about this book is that the predictions in this book aren't so far fetched since he's spoken with hundreds of scientists who are on the cutting edge of discovery right now & has witnessed some of these potential discoveries on his own. It's arranged in such a way that while there is a progression necessary in the book to follow things, the science is simplied to a point where the average reader isn't overwhelmed by the details. This is very much a fun book to enjoy for anyone who wants a vision of where we might be by the dawn of the 22nd century."

This fact based book was so enjoyable to him, that my kid was immediately inspired by Michio Kaku to go and purchase a pair of rare earth magnets through Amazon to resume an experiment he'd been working on before he left for the AF.  [I didn't even know you could get that kind of thing from Amazon but I'm starting to see that you can buy just about anything through Amazon.]  We always enjoyed watching the show hosted by Michio Kaku, Sci-Fi Channel's \"Explorations\"."

I do take exception, however, with his statement that U.S. Commissioner of Patents Charles H. Duell said, in 1899, that everything had could be invented had already been invented.  This attribution has been debunked.  Rather, in 1902, Duell stated:\" In my opinion, all previous advances in the various lines of invention will appear totally insignificant when compared with those which the present century will witness. I almost wish that I might live my life over again to see the wonders which are at the threshold.\"  Now, while this has no bearing on the science Dr. Kaku presents, it shows a touch of carelessness which could have been easily eliminated with a bit of fact checking."

While I've seen him in numerous television shows and interviews this is the first book of his that I have read. I loved it. He makes it so the lay man can understand physics concepts, but he doesn't \"dumb it down\" so much that it's boring. It's not purely a physics book either. He talks about current situations, like the energy crisis and going green and suggest future situations where we can improve or better ourselves. There are some grim scenarios but overall it's a positive view of the future. That's why I guess I like the book so much. I loved to read up on the latest futurist, Ray Kurzweil, etc. It's one of my favorite reads so when I found out Michio had written a futurist book; I had to check it out. It's been difficult to put down. I definitely plan on reading more of his books."

I never felt bogged down by concepts that were too complex to explain, and many times I would stop and contemplate how the future would look when reading some of his concepts and predictions. For those who have only been exposed to Michio through his many tv appearances and would like to get more of his unique offerings - this book is a great way to get more insight from him and his incredible mind. Not only will you learn a few things, you will be entertained along the way."

Physics of the Future seems to me a much more productive conversation for our current political narrative."

                "Text": "Received this book has a gift, probably would of skipped it otherwise.  Michio is one of many popularizers of science, and this book is of that trend.  Written for general audiences, light on scientific theory going quickly into sci-fi speculation.  Some of the topics are old and are repeated here again, for instance the dream of fusion reactors and robots being our personal servants.  We've heard this for the past thirty or more years and it still seems a long way off.  With that in mind it's hard not to be skeptical of his other predictions, programmable matter, self replicating robots and so on.  Still, I did enjoy his overview of emerging technologies and their potential for changing society."

While there is a bit of physics in regards to space travel, it's not as physics centered as Physics of the Impossible."

Equally parts fascinating and upsetting, only because I would donate all of my internal organs just to see interstellar travel just once before I die, and he spells out reasons why it's very unrealistic for me to expect this in my lifetime. Problems like unsustainable population grown due to rapid advances in medical technology could've used a little more attention, but overall this was a really good read, and I would recommend it highly to anyone interested in this particular field"

Besides that, it is a very interesting read, especially for anyone interested in how technology is evolving and changing our world. The author takes a pretty objective approach- in other words he is not gung ho about some advances or wickedly fearful of the future. He has a very practical approach to the future of science and it's effects on our society as a whole. His writing style is easy to read, not too complex for the non-science person. I've used it as a research book for building my futuristic world and for that it has been a great resource."

                "Text": "I've read 3 other books by Micho Kaku and they all start out the same way with him explaining how he got interested in physics. I listen to and watch a lot of science programs and there's very little here that I haven't seen/herd before. I liked his earlier books much better. He really knows how to bring a very complicated subject down to a layman's understandable level. But this book is about predicting the future and we all know how unpredictable that is (the Jetsons come to mind). They have been working on robots for decades that the common man could use and so far the best they have come up with is a relatively useless vacuum cleaner and a automated drink serving tray. We all want that robot that will do what the Jetsons robot could do. About five years ago I heard about a collage student that was trying to invent just a robotic dish washer that could deal with the dirty dishes from picking up the dirty dishes, scraping off the food, scrubbing the hard food off, washing and drying and putting them away. But so far I haven't herd anything successful in that project. It's just to complicated for a computer to tell the difference between the dirt on the dish or a printed pattern. That's because computers don't have the ability to understand anything and I don't believe they ever will. Even those cars that can drive them selves only react to censer input. The computer driving the car has no understanding like humans do as to what it's doing. He even predicts our doctor in the future will be an interaction with a computer. While I think that's possible I don't think the doctor's union (medical association) would go for that. To much money involed and would you really trust your health to a health diagnostic devise that's similar to our GPS devices. Anybody that has used GPS extensively knows it makes mistakes (like telling you to turn left onto a road that isn't there) I would like to see Dr Kaku write a book about all the work and successes that physicist's out side of the theoretical physics world have done. We the average Joe know little about there contributions to new and recent developments in such topics as new materials that have been developed like batteries that can be  made into any shape. But as with his Science Channel program SciFi Science Dr Kaku seems to be heading down the same road as the programing that has overtaken the Discovery channel designed to appeal to the beer guzzling, dumb ass segment of our society, or children under 16 years old."

Because Michio Kaku was able to cover so many subjects in only a few hundred pages. His style is clear, synthetic and passionate. I also believe that it is a very important book, because it shows in a simple and entertaining way the importance of science, especially in an era where many young people are still ignorant or unaware of  the many challenges that face our civilization in the future."

Growing body parts, creating life and the human android. Immortality and on, on, on. Only a fool would want to live forever. And the thought of losing what makes us human, ourselves, is in my opinion, Balderdash! If you desire immortality and want to live on barren planets to exist, you have my blessing. Otherwise, keep science and the desire for all knowing immortality out of my personal space. All these science types want is control and dependence on themselves. As far as recreating dinosaurs, why? Could not control them millions of years ago and won't be able to now. Stupidity!! I'm 74 years old and would not change a damned thing, and, will leave on my own terms at three score and ten, plus!"

He covers all sorts of topics from the future of computers, AI, medicine, energy and space travel. This is a truly enjoyable book and I recommend it to anybody with at least a passive interest in science. I will try to read the other books by Michio Kaku."

                "Text": "Don't expect any details on the exciting possibilities presented by Kaku. It's a light read, perfect for the everyday layman who is wondering what the future may be like. However, when Dr. Kaku ventures out into geopolitics things can get a little muddy. Particularly, his views into \"Islamic terrorism\" are horribly simplistic. Kaku avoids getting into the reasons behind the existence of terrorism, and takes the easy route into the \"they hate us for our freedoms\" la-la-land. Perhaps the major letdown in the book was finding a quote by the loathsome Thomas Friedman towards the end of the book. Kaku is smart enough to be able to prove a point without quoting that odious gasbag."

When considering the overriding theme of this book that Dr. Kaku consistently proves that scientific progress has invariably led to improved living conditions for humanity in all ways (albeit with some unfortunate consequences at times), it seems to me that this book should become as ubiquitous and important to the human race as the Bible (Quran, etc, etc) has been for the past two thousand years.  If the turnout for his book tour across the country is any indication (sold out shows), a younger generation that sees things more clearly than its forebears could well make that happen and it would be of huge benefit to our world."

Parts of this book are mind blowing, particularly when discussing the possibilities of future space travel. Unfortunately, he allows his politics to largely skew the entire book. For example, he keeps referring to the ipcc when discussing global warming, and continues to cite their predictions at the end of the book. However, he completely ignores the fraudulent practices from the scientists of east Anglia, England, often referred to as \"climate gate\". In short, much of the \"data\" was fudged.... As a scientist, you would think to at least mention this rather than citing fudged data as fact simply to suit your political beliefs. He also assumes that nation states will weaken, citing the European union as an example... Ignoring the glaring fact that the eu is collapsing as we speak, and that most people are not too thrilled to have their sovereignty taken away. In short, I still highly respect him as a relatable and personal science, but please shut up about your politics... Or in the very least, be more open about how your personal biases are influencing your predictions,"

Talks about \"advances\" from an elitist-science-nerd and pollyanna point of view.  Ends with a Disney world ride into space as an advance and accomplishment of science.  Space bases on the Moon and 3 billion on earth with malaria.  This book is an absolute no-no for school children.  Has nothing to do with the needs and lives of a  vast majority of real people.  Builds on the unproven concept that advances in technology will automatically bring wealth to a larger portion of the world's population and that education will allow the voting population to make more rational decisions.  Neglects the effects of advances in technology increasing the possibility of more destructive wars and destabilizing world order."

I cannot believe that he has so lack of vision. He believes that Moores Law will slow down or stop. I wonder if he has ever read a great book The Singularity is Near. Moores Law is a narrow focus on computer technology and Ray Kurzweil, who is a visionary teaches about The Law of accelerating returns that is much larger in scope and has to do with the exponential acceleration of information in evolution technology. I admire Ray for writing a book that is intelligent and does not dumb down to the reader. Michio does not understand his readers and wants to cater to the general public and I found this book insulting in something to read that is intelligent."

It is just a sermon on outlandish ideas wrapped up in atheistic mumbo jumbo with an extreme socialistic background.  Not only does he constantly degrade God and praise \"Mother Nature\" but he obviously believes man is his own God.  But the final bit of nonsense is his later chapters on Economics and Capitalism.  He preaches the absurd Marxist viewpoint on all political issues.  I still would like to know what that gibberish has to do with physics.  This book is just a monologue on the beliefs of an atheistic, left-wing  extremist.  If that is your take on life be a masochist and read it.  If you want to learn more about physics get another book."
