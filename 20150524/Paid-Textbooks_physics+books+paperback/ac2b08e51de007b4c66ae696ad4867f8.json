The way the ideas are presented (from a historical and evolutionary perspective) plus the illustrations make this complex topic understandable.  I found a pleasure to read the book several times just to refresh the new concepts.  After reading this book I feel I understand concepts that I could not grasp before.  I have 3 other books about the subject but none of them come close to this one.  Quite a gem of a book!"

Although the book is an introduction, I would gather the book  presumes you have some previous knowledge of (probably findamental)  algebra, chemistry, thermodynamics and a solid foundation of QED.  Seriously, its a good book and well written, and made hard conecpts a  little bit easier to understand. Math has never been my subject so you may  have better luck with it."

Quantum theory is completely counter-intuitive. This is where this book excels. The authors, J.P. McEvoy and Oscar Zarate, are very clear about what is physical reality and what is a mathematical construct. Of course, the mathematical constructs produce testable hypotheses which have proven that quantum theory works. The book provides an overview of the development of the theory and delves a little into the personalities of the people involved. Some of the math gets complicated but that can be easily skipped over. The real fun of the story is in how scientists built on the works of each other. Part of the fun is in all the graphics, several of which explain the experiments. I found the book an innovative way of explaining the subject and recommend it for anyone interested in quantum mechanics or the history of science."

It gives a very nice macro picture of what quantum physics is about.  After reading it, I have a renewed sense of wonder about the natural world and how mathematics describes the natural world.  This book also gives background on the history of science and how major discoveries fit together.  I will recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about quantum physics and is also somewhat intimidated by it (who isn't).  I wish this book had been part of my high school physics curriculum...I would have loved physics had it been taught this way."

For those sensitive to this sort of thing, there's a biographical page on Schrodinger which is R-rated.  (Well, maybe PG-13.  Whatever.)"

It is a good overview to read once again after a deep study in some specialized topic. Even interesting and necessary to have for a physicist therefore, as well as for any interested newcomer.

I have some formal education in classical physics, and am trying to familiarize myself with the very intriguing subject of quantum mechanics.  I always felt like I was trying to assemble a picture-puzzle with all of the pieces face down.  It shouldn\u2019t be this hard.  After reading this book, the big picture is finally coming into focus.  I now know exactly what it is that I didn\u2019t understand.  I can\u2019t accept some of the assertions made by quantum theories, but at least I now know how and why we\u2019ve gotten to this point.  Historically speaking, it\u2019s about time for another Newton/Einstein to show up and reveal the next surprise behind the curtain."

I honestly had no idea whatsoever what the equations meant. In fact, I didn't even realize that quantum physics essentially was chemistry until I read this book. The way the author introduces and explains the work undertaken to tease out each of the wonderful laws of quantum theory is fantastic. He truly makes it fun and exciting to unravel the mystery of the tiny particles/waves/strings that make up our universe... I simply couldn't put the book down until I finished! I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about chemistry and quantum theory."
