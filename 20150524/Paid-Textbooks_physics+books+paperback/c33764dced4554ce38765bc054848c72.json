                "Text": "I've read \"The Tao Of Physics\" two and one half times. The first time was fifteen years ago (the original paperback was a different edition, with a far more thought provoking cover). I then read this edition when it came out (I need to read it a third time, this time with more life experience to draw from). I'm sure most readers struggled with the technical dialogue and laws of physics throughout. I was more able to intuitively appreciate these tougher chapters than intellectually understand these sometimes very abstract and  difficult theories and concepts. Mysticism at times can seem equally abstract and difficult when one has not expereinced specific \"mystical\" experiences or enough of life itself. However, I intuitively connected to the threads which Capra so painstakingly weaved into his book. I was not looking for the answers to the universe in this book. What I was hoping to find was guidance, and a springboard in which to think in a larger universe. And when I look back, I realize my awareness and receptiveness to a \"universe\"and \"consciousness\" which is infinitely larger and wiser than the human experience and consciousness does indeed exits. \"The Tao Of Physics\" opened a window or two for me, and the inertia in which I had formed my opinions and prejudices and, then, learned to see and feel and judge the world around me, seemed embarrassingly narrow, lacking and unwise. That was a great insight for this young man at that time. \"The Tao Of Physics\" remains one of those books and experience that initially changed me in a small way, that eventually evolved into a substantive life change in how I think and perceive the world around me, and my relationship to it."

                "Text": "The book is a well organized presentaion of the simple observation that  science, religion, and philosophy are all trying to describe the same  reality in different terms and from different perspectives.  Taoism and  modern physics both take a minimally subjective approach to the task of  realizing what life is and are both extremely helpful to anyone searching  for the source of true spirituality.  The first review in this set refers  to Taoism as a branch of metaphysics, which it certainly is not.  Although  the book deals with various major Eastern religions, it is a good  introduction to Taoism and, for those searching, should be preceded by,  concurrently read with, and perpetually followed by reference to the Tao Te  Ching.  Most importantly, awareness of ones own life and its relationship  with the rest of the universe is the key; the answers can not be found in  any book."

                "Text": "Capra takes a step backwards to get everything into the picture and shows how a selection of eastern schools of thought and modern physics think so much alike.  He manages this without shoving religious dogma down your  throat or losing you in mathematics.  As a physicist, I was sceptical  about this book as often modern physics has been taken completely out of  its context and misinterpreted. Capra shows a thorough understanding of the  quantum mechanical and relativistic principles illustrated in this book.  For the non-physicist I would advise reading up some material on  introductory relativity and quantum physics beforehand, just as I felt  disadvantaged not having a good background in eastern philosophy. This book  strengthens my belief that an understanding of the human situation comes  not from a single spiritual or intellectual paradigm,  but from a  unification of the fruits of all human endeavours."

                "Text": "Shows interesting parallels between Taoist philosophy and western science. I've read three different sources in Taoist thought and I have to say that Mr. Capra has done a great job in making this book readable to the average \"joe\". Although I've long given-up my \"eastern philosophy phase\", I would still recommend this book. To put it simply, it's poetry in motion. Whatever your thoughts, I would suggest you read Lao Tzu's TAOISM first, then after reading this book make-up your own mind."

                "Text": "This book weaves a magical spell over the reader who is fascinated by both science and mysticism. It covers both in great depth and detail. The essential teachings of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Zen are carefully distilled and the unifying principles of these paths are identified. The one characteristic all these '-isms' share is the awareness of unity of the connectedness of the whole. Capra compares and contrasts classical and modern physics while integrating the mystical truths as discovered in these religions. It is a daunting undertaking but he succeeds with aplomb! The close parallels between Eastern mysticism and modern physics (quantum physics) is amazing - each approaches reality from a different starting point but arrives at the same place. Capra writes about the cosmic dance of particle, energy, and consciousness - highly complex topics, in a very readable manner. He touches upon Geoffrey Chew's S-matrix theory (bootstrap philosophy) and Bohm's theory of Implicate Order. He calls the paradigm shift we are experiencing \"a crisis of perception\" from which all problems in the world arise. The manner in which scientific ideas are interspersed with mystical concepts is truly astonishing! Fritjof Capra manages to precipitate the essential kernal of truth from apparent divergent viewpoints ...This is a great book for anyone exploring the relationship of the rational scientific view and mysticism, i.e., the spiritual journey.  This is a very valuable book for the modern world. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"

                "Text": "This is a great book.  My husband is an Engineering student.  This book helped me understand a lot of the things he was learning about and trying to talk to me about from his day in class.  It covers basic concepts like Newtonian/Classical Physics very clearly to help prepare the reader for the leaps away from classical physics and into the much more abstract concepts of unity and movement in the universe that come into play after Einstein.  This book was very helpful to me in that I find the mathematical approach to the sciences tedious so I never got into this that much...  I have a much more organic way of approaching learning.  I was an art history major in collage and am used to learning about large concepts then exploring how they relate to things.  The mathematical approach just never appealed to me.  So I missed out a lot on just how cool physics is!  I'm grateful to have a book that takes a comprehensive approach and made this information so accessible.  I have a background in Zen, Buddhism, Budo, Christianity, and some Native American spirituality and have felt a connection between them all.  I also grew up, oddly enough, rather synical so a book that takes a scientific approach to mystical understanding is just a phenomenal idea to me!  This book along with \"The Portable world Bible\", and actively taking part in art, meditation, martial arts training, and ceremony really helped me find those connections and come to a much fuller level of appreciation for life and the physics within it.  I got a great deal out of this book, not only in understanding science and my husband a bit better but in understanding the unity and movement of the nonphysical universe as well.  All in all I give this book two big thumbs up!"

                "Text": "This was one of those books that I had read when younger, but could not fully arrive at a conclusion until recently. This time I re-read afresh after spending a better part of a decade studying both science as well as Indian philosophy and language. The book is well written overall, but in overemphasizing the mystical view, the author tends to unintentionally give a misleading view to the non-specialist with regards to the need of the scientific method. (ref. my own personal experiences) As a rationalist, I also needed more emphasis on the fact that all ancient thinkers (Greek, Indian and Chinese) DID NOT understand modern physics in the same way the scientific community at large does today, as this tends to be what some readers take home. In that sense, I can only agree with the global correlations and parallels because they can be the product of a philosophical thought process. The micro parallels are Dr. Capra's vision, which is an independent debatable viewpoint. However, this was a very good attempt to show that these people were nonetheless leading intellects of their time and deserve due credit (often prejudged negatively) for a unique ancient philosophical approach to understand nature.  I wanted an equally detailed discussion of the other half of the picture, as all eastern thought was not limited to mysticism as many in the West tend to conclude. Thinkers of the time also frequently chose a very systematic method.  Examples include Panini, Aryabhatta, Brahmagupta and Bhaskara, whose contributions to modern Mathematics and Sushruta to plastic surgery are profound. For the future, I would like to see a composite rendition of  eastern thought in a new book by ??."

The Tao of Physics does not explain reality either, as reality can only be lived, but it does begin to provide a 'hard-core' science-based-perspective that allows for mystical and parapsychological experiences. Capra does a good job at explaining the concepts and history of quantum physics. For me personally, I can say that this book is the most important book I have ever read because it opened the door to Eastern religion and so much more. We in the West are taught the primacy of science, reason, and logic, and because of that are led to discount certain types-of-thought as mumbo-jumbo. But quantum physics is wholly logical, and wholly proven, and if fully excepted, should blow your mind."

Capra's work is one of those books that unfortunately becomes somewhat demonized because its very insight becomes distorted in the mass media. I'm sure you've heard and been frustrated by the new-age hyperbole about how science is \"proving\" Buddhism and all sorts of mystical beliefs, as if Buddhism or any spiritual insight needs or deserves to be \"proven.\" Capra was not trying to tell us to see quantum mechanics and relativity theory as proof of any religious or mystical ideology: he was merely pointing to parallels in the way different perspectives enrich our knowledge of ourselves and our universe. He was an articulate voice asking us to question the dualisms and oppositions that we have allowed to creep into our experience of the world and of our inner lives. This is why Capra's work has endured, and why it will continue to do so."

                "Text": "Despite the fact that this book was written more than a decade ago..it still continues to be the the most sought after book for anyone who in intrested in the intrincically interwoven relationship between Modern  Science and Mysticism. This is primarily so because over the ages ,as  science advanced bringing forth the most sophisticated tools to observe and  explore the physical world,mankind not only became aware of the complexity  of the physical world but also of the limitations of the scientific method  itself as one approaches some of the deep and fundamental questions of our  very existence!This is so because we observe the universe through the  eyes  of what is known..which eventually leads us to the realm of the  unknown!Here the scientest stands baffled at the marvel of creation...and  it is this feeling of awe and wonder(as Einstein put it)that eventually  leads to deep contemplation of metaphysical reality...which can only be  perceived at the experiential level.No wonder the Nobel Prize winning  Physicist John Wheeler  coined the term\"The Participatory  Universe\"!This forms the very foundation of Dr.Capra's work!  Delving deep into the latest advances of modern Physics and ancient Eastern  scriptures/Mysticism Dr.Capra brings forth startling parallels between the  revelations of the Sage rooted in the Realization of the underlying reality  of our physical universe and the the Scientest's  rationalisation of the  obsevable universe!This is the point where Physics gets metamorphosised  into Metaphysics...\"What the Scientest experiments outside...the Sage  experiences within....Both encounter the same reality criscrossed\"!  Religions of the east were rooted more in Spirituality...and precisely  because of this reason the Sages of the yore realised the Universe within  as well!They saw the Universe as a Whole.. in it's entiriety!..Modern  Physics now talks of the \"Systems world view,Chaos theory,Bootstrap  theory\"..and a whole lot of so called new theories which are nothing  but the limited verbal expressions of the Vision of reality experienced by  the Sages!This is clearly reflected in a beautiful Vedic hymn chanted  honouring one's master..one's Spiritual Perceptor(Guru):  \"The vision  of the truth  an indivisible whole  encompassing the static and the  dynamic  living and the nonliving...  to that master my  Salutations\"! The Tao(way)of Physics this vision of Life as seen from  the Scientific perspective!"

This book translates abstract physics into something enjoyable, approachable and full of meaning of what life is in its essence as motion and transformation. In fact, I gained more of an intuitive understanding about quantum (really absolute) reality from reading this book than I did from my physics classes at the University of Chicago. Having also studied eastern mysticism in the Tao te Ching and other works, I was interested in a book that demonstrated the similarities. I didn't learn very much new about Eastern mysticism, but having physics taught in this way was remarkable, as if the science was transcending the intellect and speaking directly to the soul about life's mysteries."

Certainly there is much righteous offense offered under the guise of science in many of the reviews. Neither approach fits my understanding. I saw Capra as trying to harmonize the rationality of the West with the empiricism of the East. Beginning with equating the unknowable essence preceding the big bang theory of the West with the unknowable essence of the Tao, he then extends the comparison of Aristotle's concept of the Golden Mean with the concept of ying/yang. Taoism proposes not rationality and second hand explanations of Western science, but direct experience as the keystone of living. That Capra's science may in fact be dated is hardly the point. That there is a balance of nature found in both systems is his thesis. The West is uncomfortable with nature as such and has generally treated it as a an external mechanism that has been constructed and therefore can (and should) be deconstructed like any machine. Taoism sees nature as an organic whole grown, not assembled. Western science seems to increasingly concur the latter view."

It says it is for doing searches but one would assume one would already know what one was searching for...I don't know. It may be my first generation Kindle. I suppose the younger generations have more navigating options..."

Anyone interested in learning more about these two topics will enjoy this book merely for content.  But, Capra tries to draw parallels between the two worlds using very general and obscure arguments.  Religion and physics have nothing to do with each other, and in the end Capra proves this, the opposite of which he intended.  All in all the general reader will enjoy this, but an educated physicist will either laugh or become too frustrated by Capra's generalities to ever finish the book."

In fact, thinking I was original in some of my propositions I find Capra postulated them more than 30 years ago. But he offers much more than this, he has the rare ability to translate the complex concepts into simple and beautiful phrases. I did not give him the 5 stars because some of the later chapters are arid. Truly a classic in its field."

The book is a wonderful telling, in a 'western' kind of way, of the simple and beautiful truth that embodies everything. It draws fascinating parallels between what we thought was the 'heartless' creed of science and ancient wisdom of the East; what deep and releasing insights follow every word! Capra (read also Web of Life!) gives all of us a new perspective to see the world, to \"experience the wholeness of nature\" and offers a meditative approach to \"the art of living in harmony with it\". Like 'the Prophecy' it adds to our ever-growing awareness of the universe and its intricate network of love, light and life; it is so undoubtedly true in the path that it follows, a simple miracle in an everyday Zen-life. Spread the word: mother Earth is transforming her  consciousness and while we help we rise with the waves and view the absolute ocean-floor...the timeless, whatever the meaning, and the simple beauty. Thank you, Fritjof Capra, for your contribution!"

                "Text": "I've read \"The Tao Of Physics\" two and one half times. The first time was fifteen years ago (the original paperback was a different edition, with a far more thought provoking cover). I then read this edition when it came out (I need to read it a third time, this time with more life experience to draw from). I'm sure most readers struggled with the technical dialogue and laws of physics throughout. I was more able to intuitively appreciate these tougher chapters than intellectually understand these sometimes very abstract and  difficult theories and concepts. Mysticism at times can seem equally abstract and difficult when one has not expereinced specific \"mystical\" experiences or enough of life itself. However, I intuitively connected to the threads which Capra so painstakingly weaved into his book. I was not looking for the answers to the universe in this book. What I was hoping to find was guidance, and a springboard in which to think in a larger universe. And when I look back, I realize my awareness and receptiveness to a \"universe\"and \"consciousness\" which is infinitely larger and wiser than the human experience and consciousness does indeed exits. \"The Tao Of Physics\" opened a window or two for me, and the inertia in which I had formed my opinions and prejudices and, then, learned to see and feel and judge the world around me, seemed embarrassingly narrow, lacking and unwise. That was a great insight for this young man at that time. \"The Tao Of Physics\" remains one of those books and experience that initially changed me in a small way, that eventually evolved into a substantive life change in how I think and perceive the world around me, and my relationship to it."

Posed as a comparative reflection on the similarities of the tenets of eastern mysticism and the energy packets perceived through experimentation, Capra brings a rational and logical tapestry to light that helps conceptualize an overall hypothesis of the energy (deity) that is pervasive in the universe, and is instructionally meaningful to our meager intellect. He provides an alternative explanation to superstition and miracles for our (not just humans, but all things as well as time) being and existence."

Capra's relations bewteen mysticism and physics are quite objectable and some references made to theory confoundingly irrational.  His assertion at times that subatomic particles can \"think\" and are almost \"organic\" are simply contradictory to sensical physics.  Many of his \"parallels\" are perspective-sensitive beliefs with basis on unsupported theory.  It is exactly information of this nature that keep the world of science balancing on its ears trying to keep from falling into the abyss of superstition from which we spewed less than half a millenia ago.  My advice to the reader of this: do so for the sole purpose of experiencing just how unscientific books categorized under \"science\", can be."
