The only reason I give this 3 stars (my real rating would be a 3.75/5), is because the amount of problems that it gives the solutions to is miniscule. I mean seriously, I've bought solutions manuals before that have come with a solution to EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM! And yet this covers a little more than half the odd problems. That's it. It's expensive for just that much. If you want to make sure that you're getting the right answer though, and you want to make sure you can do all types of problems, this solutions manual is ok."
