                "Text": "I have had little background in QM, but this book seems to explain the basics along with the fundamentals in a logical order. (Nice philosophical and logical development of Schro's Eqn and operators too) Arranged in a  somewhat strange manner, it definitely uncovers some of the more  misunderstood concepts (such as Dirac notation and dispersion relations),  and at this price it's probably well worth it!  Mostly based on  applications dealing with solid state physics."
