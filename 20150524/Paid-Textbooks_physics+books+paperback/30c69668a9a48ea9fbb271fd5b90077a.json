This is the movie that keeps you thinking and pondering even after the lights go up. I've seen it three times and plan to buy the DVD when it comes out next year. This movie has helped me re-evaluate how I look at life! Awesome!"

                "Text": "This is a case of the movie being a LOT better than the book.  The reason is that the tone and the conversational style of the book are so \"cutsey,\" so patronizing, so ... tiresome; it reminds me of one of the Dummies books.  The writers ask so many questions:  \"So what exactly are emotions?  Heard of endorphins? Sound familiar?  When was the last time you had an orgasm from a higher level?\"  I'm really into the subject matter and I'm 3/4 of the way through the book, but I don't think I can finish it, just because the bad writing (not the quantum physics) makes it so hard to read.  I wish the authors had just said what they had to say without studying the Dummies format beforehand.  If someone picks up a book about the relationship between spirituality and quantum physics, they have to have had some intelligence and some prior reading in both subjects.  These authors don't recognize that.  Fritjof Capra it's not."

                "Text": "This book was promising to start with, and had some good premises which carried through the book, like that we are causative over our lives and we create our own reality.  The Quantum stuff is interesting, though best studied in other places.  But the book was ruined for me by the incessant return to one overriding theme: that we are just brains, or chemical reactions in a brain.  The very concept that they kept pushing throughout the book, of breaking away from old paradigms and seeing things in a new way was consistently violated by their inability to break away from converting every idea, whether it was mysticism, quantum physics, eastern philosophy, or telepathy, to materialism,  somehow reducing it down to brains.  Sometimes they would even bring up phenomena that was totally unexplainable by physical means, like time travel, or being out the body, but by some twist of logic would settle back to the old paradigm of explaining away everything with the chemicals in the brain.  So, for a book that had great potential I was ultimately very disappointed.  A better read to open up your mind to the possibilities of existence is The Holographic Universe."

Discovering The Endless Possibilities For Altering Your Everyday Reality: at once a science book and a self-help and spiritual guide, and based on a movie as well, it tackles the questions of uncertainty, the nature of reality, and how physical, mental and spiritual forces interact in shaping human reality. Don't expect any easy answers here: What The Bleep Do We Know is an overview of science and spiritual questions which sets out what is known about each, and points the reader in different directions where the outer limits of science and psyche embrace. Any considering the nature of consciousness, intelligence, reality, or attitude adjustment will find this packed with insights and lively discussion which is surprisingly easy to access considering the weight of the matters under review."

                "Text": "If you suffer from anxiety or a deep fear, you are not alone; this is a part of the human condition. But we don't have to suffer endlessly because anxiety has an internal structure in the form of negative thoughts and beliefs powered by emotional energy that has become frozen in place. Uncover these patterns of negative thoughts and you are on the way to making significant change. As a mindfulness-based psychotherapist, I use mindfulness as the primary tool for doing just this, and I would recommend anyone to learn more about the therapeutic use of mindfulness in conjunction with good self-analysis. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation', available through Amazon."

I am happy to report that this book does not disappoint.  I have been recommending it to everyone because it not only goes further in explaining  Superposition, Quantum Entanglement, and Emotional Addictions, but it also gives an \"insiders\" view as to how such concepts affect our everyday reality.  It is hard not to be passionate about a book that I think should be read by every high school and college student in the country as well as the rest of us.  If people applied these principles, it would inevitably lead to a better world.  The book is also beautifully designed.  I know what I will be giving for Christmas gifts this year."

And when we can show that our mental attitude can affect the entire world it becomes a serious problem.  I have been wondering about the terrible damages we have experienced recently in tidal waves, earthquakes, tornadoes and simply killing people and tried to relate it to our personal attitudes toward each other.  This book gives a basic fact to begin to work from.  In the last century 50,000,000 people died in wars, and we are already on the way to beat that in this century. If we believe man is here for a purpose we have a problem.  This book does two things:  it offers you a basic philosophy to work from and it puts you at the beginning of a path that should lead to a solution, but it will take the whole world to work together.  My only regret is that that I am already 85 and I will have to come back to help.  I think this will be a book that many people will find important and worth having."

I stopped and purchased three other books that left the scientific explanation out and got right to the point.  One of the books was E2, just to give you and idea.  After reading the 3 books about quantum physics I was able to come back to this one and finish it.  I learned from the book and I appreciate all the scientific research behind it, but I enjoyed the others better because they concentrate in giving you direct advise.  If you heard about this book and you are still curious, I recommend the movie instead because the book talks about it constantly.  I have not seen the movie, but with so much talk in the book maybe you can go directly to it and skip the book.  Whatever your preference is; movie or book, I would still recommend either one as long as you select one because we all need to be educated in the subject."

The book will take you on a journey into quantum mechanics and proceed to explain how quantum physics differs from classical Newtonian physics.  This is just the beginning.  The book is a compilation of interviews with scientists, Ph.D.'s and people who are realizing that matter and consciousness are connected.

If the vilest villain read this he would start to reevaluate his life and if we read it then we'll be able to understand and maybe forgive him. The World can be better then it is. Is this book and movie the changing mind shift novelty Terence McKenna predicted? This book is much more then a launching point it is a psychedelic mind melting catapult in consciousness changing. Change you're perceptions, Change who you are! This book is Enjoyable to read and will affect who you are for the better. If you want to Understand or just be Entertained you will be pleasantly surprised on both fronts. Can you have everything you want from life, if you believe you can it will begin The Process that makes it happen! This book is a tie-in for the most important Film to date and you and everyone you know and everyone should see it and read this just to SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT! And afterwards what next, while this book is a lot and very satisfying if you want more, I **RECOMMEND** you read **** ROBERT ANTON WILSON's**** books or listen to his audio book ROBERT ANTON WILSON EXPLAINS EVERYTHING (or old Bob exposes his ignorance) or watch the film about him and his ideas called Maybe Logic. But see this movie and read this book, it's a stepping-stone in the right direction!!!"

As a clinical psychologist I am always looking for insight into the factors involved in how people interpret the world around them.  This book does not approach this goal.  The stated intent for the book is that if a million people focused on the book then reality would shift for the world.  This book is for those interested in magic, mysticism, superstition and childish metaphysics.  Yes, I read two thirds of the book.  My practical joker has his payback coming."

Anyway a friend recommended the film to me and I found it to be fascinating, thought provoking and enjoyable . I come form an academic science background and so I naturally have to analysis things through critical/analytical eyes. A lot of the suggestions presented in this movie are on the edge of science and therefore are educated ideas/throughts. The idea of consciousness having a link with quantum physics theories would make \"pure\" academics eyes roll.
