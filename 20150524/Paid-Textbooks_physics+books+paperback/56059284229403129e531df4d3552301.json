                "Text": "I cannot put this book down. It has so much information about the depth of how and why the the body systems work from consciousness to unconscious. I especially like the information about communication through the connective tissue. There is so much great information I cannot do justice to speak of this man's work. We truly are a living matrix. He has a great way of explaining that I can understand though he does address much from a technical point. I am a nurse and energy healer and this information gives me truth and understanding to the depths of healing possibilities. Nancy Doyle"

                "Text": "I am a wholistic health and energy management practitioner. Any food or supplement or reading I use that I consider important to my mental, physical, emotional, spiritual health is tested energetically for the \u201ctruth\u201d and integration of it before my consumption. I have no life to waste on careless consumption in these realms. My recommendations reflect this process.This information is core to the understanding of the body as a consciousness as well as other aspects of human performance. Yes there is brain-nervous system consciousness, but there is the second, body consciousness made o up of the continuous matrix of connective tissue that is the body. As the seat of the second consciousness it is amenable to modulation and my own treatment methodology was enhanced, indeed revolutionized as I understood this work and the good available in itsd understanding. Hurrah for the truth and effort in this book! Thank you Oschman!"

                "Text": "I have not read much about body energy research in the last 40 years. The progress in the field research appears to be happening with significant results. So far 2 medical professionals and a few others have seen me reading the book and want to borrow it. Most interesting. The specific energy forms at the cellular and molecular level and the way that energy may be transferred in the body matrix is facinating. The possible scientific explanations based in measured observation of some bodily and psychological phenomena gives a basis for understanding for experiences we otherwise might question."
