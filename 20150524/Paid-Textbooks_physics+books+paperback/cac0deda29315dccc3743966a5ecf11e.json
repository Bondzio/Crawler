                "Text": "R.P. Feynman was more than just a physicist with a staggering intuitive understanding of the machinery of complex equations and physical laws, he was also very human and sane and filled with simple awe at the natural world. If you want to begin to understand the kind of genius he had, and to feel his enthusiasm for teaching, then buy the first book of this set. It is the easiest to follow since it deals with basic physics for the most part. If you have a solid physics background, and/or a high IQ, then venture forth into volume two and three."

I have read the books that are based on these  lectures but hearing Feynman himself gives me the chills. This guy enjoys  the stuff and is capable of transfering this joy to his audience. No  surprise his lectures became legendary. (Wish my physics professors had  been a little bit more like this guy and less like tibetan monks :) One  question remains - why the heck have these tapes been published so late?  Gimme more - please!"
