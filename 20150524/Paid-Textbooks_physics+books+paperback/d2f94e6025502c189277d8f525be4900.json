                "Text": "I hold the opinion that Richard Feynman was the best physics teacher of all times. I keep his three red volumes always at the main position of my bookshelves, aside Dirac's \"Principles of Quantum Mechanics\" and  the Landau-Lifshitz collection. What is it that puts them in a class apart  from every other introductory text? A Nobel-prize winner, Giaever, I think,  said that he seldom had to reach for other book of physics than Feynman's.  On the other hand, the very respected mathematician Gian Carlo Rota gave it  a bad review, orienting students to go instead to Halliday-Resnick for  help. Perhaps these opposite opinions give us a clue: Feynman's  \"Lectures\" are the sole book to present basic physics as a living  subject, as real physics, that thing that researchers slowly build in their  day-to-day toil.For the author, as always, strived to rebuild everything  almost from scratch, sometimes with great originality. This explains why we  never grow tired of it. It explains too why it \"lacks\" the  organization of a text designed solely by pedagogical purposes. It's an  asset, rather than a liability. If you are a beginner, use both (Feynman  and Halliday-Resnick). In Feynman you'll see the magic and understand the  beauty of a career in physics, as in nowhere else."

                "Text": "Feynman's famous three-volume set is an edited set based on his lectures to the introductory physics classes at Caltech, which are widely considered to be among the best lecture series ever published.  Feynman takes a different approach from the typical introductory physics textbook.  His point of departure perhaps assumes a higher level of mathematical sophistication than most introductory or survey texts.  Also, his choice of topics is not as broad and comprehensive as many modern surveys of introductory physics.  What makes Feynman's work remarkable is the his manner of explaining physical principles underlying a topic, instead of simply presenting the traditional expression of a rule and its formal mathematical expression.  When one completes reading a section of Feynman's lecture, if one has the mathematical sophistication one will obtain a \"feel\" for how the topic fits in the broad context of physics as a whole.  As a note of caution:  most introductory physics surveys do not present material with use of matrix mathematics.  Feynman assumes familiarity with the basics of matrix algebra, and this fact makes his presentation challenging to many students.  In various sources I have read that his lectures were well attended by students in the upper division portion of their education and many graduate students and faculty, while the freshman audience intended may have been  poor.  That reflects the series as being a high-level conceptual overview reflecting the unified structure of physics.  Perhaps not suitable for introductory physics instruction to any but the most advanced students."

                "Text": "This is an excellent series of lectures that is great to supplement the standard introductory material dealing with these subjects.  It isn't a textbook and it doesn't address any of the subjects contained within it as rigorously as texts that are devoted to the particular subjects.  Still, the lectures contained hererin present material in new and enlightening ways.  Even if you already know the material through a different text, Feynman will get you thinking about things you never thought about and might make things more conceptually clear.  The lectures read quite well and often can be read out of order.  One word of caution: there are a couple books out there, like \"Six Easy Peices\", that are just scaled down versions of this set of lectures.  No need to buy those books if you own this."

                "Text": "The Feynman lectures on physics is a transcript of some of the lectures Feynman gave at the California Institute of Technology to freshman and sophomore students.  It was somewhat of an \"experiment\"; feynman had never done this before. He purposed to adress these lectures to the most \"intelligent\" of the class.  It should be no surprise that these lectures are difficult.  Remember this is Caltech.  Feynman assumes knowledge of certain subjects, such as calculus (the review inside is very elementary) and very basic physics equations such as Newton's Gravitational Law.  These things aside, this texbook is one of the best college \"texbooks\" you can get; captivating, and very challenging (boy i've spent nights wrestling over certain abstract topics).  Feynman at his best; he can be quite humourous at times: for example when he pokes fun of philosphers.  My biggest complaint is Feynman lack of sympathy to those of us that need a bit of clarification.  So buy the books, but don't get discouraged if it's hard.  However, DO NOT buy this if math is not really your thing and you have no experience of college-level physics."

                "Text": "Upon reading these books it is immediately apparent that Richard Feyman had a complete grasp of the concepts presented.  His expositions are thoroughly well thought out, and extremely logical.  Does that make these books great tools for learning to be a practising physicist?  The answer to that question has two parts.  First, to become a competent physicist one must have a clear conceptual picture of the necessary material.  Second, this applies in particular to (although is not limited to) research, one must be able to use the concepts and the machinery to solve problems.  These books concentrate on the first problem, having a firm grasp of the concepts fundamental to physics.  It must be borne in mind that these books constitute a lecture series.  Thus, they contain only the explanations offered by Feyman in his oratory, i.e. no problems sets are included with the texts.  Therefore, they are at a significant disadvantage with respect to other, more complete treatments of the material, which is exacerbated by the price of the three volume set.  However, when supplemented by another text(s) which provides worked examples and solved problem sets, the volumes really come into their own.  Reading and digesting the contents of these three volumes will not develop all of the necessary skills required to practice physics competently, however the sheer clarity of the exposition of the concepts treated provides the student with a thorough grasp of the material from which to formulate approaches to problem solving.  Ulimately though, one needs to decide whether the price of these volumes together with that of another complementary text is worth it.  If you are serious about developing a deep understanding of the material, the answer is probably yes.  If you just need something to get you through your exams, probably not."

But I could not have turned the students aloose by themselves.  These books are full of errors in math and even some in physics.  Feynman never meant these books to become the holy grail of physics they have sort of become.  These books are the babies of an experimental freshman physics course at Cal Tech designed to reduce the outflow to the EE department.  Feynman considered the course a failure partly because of his lack of time and involvement.  Nevertheless, I have read some of the material with a great deal of enjoyment.

                "Text": "Richard Phillips Feynman is showing physics with an extremly clear view, providing all essentials of classical and quantum physics. His \u0082lectures` are the best an undergraduate can read to understand. The nobel laurate from 1965 was able to explain everything in his own very intuitive way of thinking. He is writing precise and shows a combination of experimental and theoretical physics which is searching still for competition. Sometimes, I thought, even Albert Einstein was not able to to describe thing smore simple. Very inventive are his ideas on the General Theory of Relativity in Volume two. It should be emphasized, that his physical intuition was leading him to the very important description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in chapter fifteen of volume two. He shwos, that the vector potential must be a real field. All in all, Feynman`s work should be read more than once by every physicist. I personally know men, who are experts in fields like superconductivity or gravity and still are consulting for these Feynman lectures sometimes."

In this set Dr. Feynman presents a years worth of college physics in a manner more readily digested, more intuitive, and more entertaining, than anything I have seen. Dr. Feynman pulls physics from the stuffy closet of academia, shakes off the dust and holds it up to the light so all can see what fools the 'experts' are. Dr. Feynman demonstrates none of the ego of others of his genre. His desire is clearly to convey physics to the best of his knowledge without trying to impress you with how smart he is. His informal manner, irreverent attitude, and inquisitive ponderings are refreshing. This series embodies three archetypes: What physics is, how to learn, and how to teach."

Yet somehow I manage to understand what he is trying to explain!  I am also able to appreciate the way he marvels at the beauty of the universe.  The way he repeatedly reminds us that there are lots of things about the world we don't know or understand highlights the mystery of the universe; and yet we can understand those that we can, and he guides you to do so - this highlights another mystery: our intellect!  Reading it is a unique EXPERIENCE.  I can't help but to give an example: in just two chapters, he explains lucidly how the equation E=mc2 is derived and what it means, and one actually can follow him.  Amazing."

Why should there be anything difficult about the fundamentals of nature?  You really see how simple things are at the bottom, and only get clouded when working out the details.  Feynman clearly separates the essence from the messy mathematical details of implementation.  I love how he beats a horse to death in one dimension before generalizing!  I'm sure that's how all great minds work.  Few books on quantum mechanics are of such a high caliber.  Volume three is a treasure!"

Although the maths are, of course, taken into account, you will find that  this is an easy book, clear and sincere. Sincerity is not common in high  standing books because authors are more worried about the impact that the  book will have on his/her peers than in teaching the subject to laymen or  students. This is not the case with Feynman's book. Although it has been  stated that the lectures were more popular among colleagues than among  students I can assure you that even if you don't know a word of physics you  will grasp the concepts, if not at first try at least after two or three  readings. It also conveys the thought -so popular nowadays- that human  knowledge can't be contemplated in absolute terms. We think we understand  nature but if we analyze what we really know we get to the conclusion that  this knowledge is useful but not radical. We may have good theories -useful  for remembering,\u00a0 already mentioned by Giordano Bruno- but they don't add  any deep or special knowledge about what we describe and the rules that  look so powerful and exact and allow predictions are not so exact but only  approximate and they don't give us any special insight of Nature. We may  perform complicated calculations using well known formulae involving  forces, inertia, velocity, etc but we don't really know what is inertia,  time or space."

Emphasis is on the physics reasoning more than on the maths. As such, it is a great source of inspiration to physicists and physics teachers."

The \"Feynman Lectures on Physics\" has all the spontanity  of expression that evokes awe and wonder at the marvel of creation not just  because of the fact that they were the lectures delivered at CALTECH ,it is  more so primarily because of the fact that Prof.Feynman was a passionate  Teacher and a devout seeker who looked at Nature with wonder and  reverence.His explanations of even the most difficult concepts are lucid  and clear because he gives lot of examples,analogies,smilies drawn from day  to day life.This is the greatness of a true master: To see the subtle  manifest in the gross and the gross visibly expressed in the subtle.These  lectures are sprinkled with enough humour which is quite characterstic of  Dr.Feynman.This makes the reading all the more enjoyable.the most striking  feature of his lectures is the finishing touche he gives to every main area  in Physics ;most of the lectures have a tail ender titled  \"Philosophical Implications\" and this is how Prof.Feynman  communicates more of his Insight than mere Information. I'm just reminded  of these remarkable  words from Prof.Feynman's biography: \" I,an atom  in the universe,..an universe of atoms\".These words reflect the  Philosopher in him.He demonstrates through his lectures the ART of teaching  SCIENCE."

I would not say the material is difficult--this is undergraduate physics after all.  However, Feynman's view is often different in a fundamental way.  Reading the Notes is like reading special relativity for the first time--it is the splendid physical arguments that draws you.  The mathematics used is basically simple algebra."

These lectures are very hard to understand.  Partly the lectures, prepared in early 1960s, suffer from being rather dated.  Mostly though this material is presented in a confusing way, with lots of complicated mathematics that often hinders comprehension.  I recommend getting a basic college textbook instead (Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Wolfson and Pasachoff is a good choice)."
