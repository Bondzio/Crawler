                "Text": "That is a very good introduction book to cosmology at an undergraduate level. Although there are not many complicated equations, the physics ideas are very clear. It covers a lot of materials with easy-to-understand languages. The big bang model is the main part, with concise introduction to dark matter/energy, neuclosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, inflation etc. After reading this book, you will have a general idea about most of the concepts in cosmology and about what is going on in modern cosmology. Each chapter is accompanied by some problems, which are good exercise to understand the context. But I think it is a little outdated now, so maybe you should buy the 2nd edition."

The last third of the book uses General Relativity to derive the equations and goes deeper into the math and physics. The problems are interesting and help with the understanding of the subject. All the answer to the problems are given which is helpful."

It is my answer to religion because it is based on observations by our species, and nothing supernatural is claimed except for admitting that we simply don't have all the answers - yet! As for the book, I like its approach and it complements some online courses I have taken that are a little less clear. The progression from topic to topic is logical and helps the reader build understanding."

It is rare for an author to be simultaneously as knowledgeable and as transparent as Dr. Liddle. With great lucidity, this book starts from scratch and uses a step-by-step approach to construct, in the end, an imposing edifice of cosmological knowledge. The book is eminently suitable for self teaching. I would characterize this book as the ideal introductory text in the field. It is also a bargain!"
