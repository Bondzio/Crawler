                "Text": "I had the fortune of finding this book while I was interested in studying the radiative transfer of polarised radiation. It was really great! I am convinced that this book is a real jewel for anybody interested in  radiative transfer. A rare subject like Stokes polarisation is treated with  simplicity, great detail and deep understanding of the underlying physics  of photon transfer. Some years later I had the privilege of meeting  personally the author during one of his visits to the University of  Bologna. I treasure the remember of this meeting with such a fascinating  mind which had deeply impacted the whole field of radiation diffusion and  my own career."
