The author is among the many reputable scientists who has an open mind and is beginning to teach the world that the old \"Scientific-Materialism\" from last century's thinkers has now become obsolete. If you have any doubts about my claim ... read this book!"

One unfortunate aspect of the book is that it is not an easy read. Without any background in physics a few sections are almost impossible to follow and understand. I had 2 years of physics in high school and one year in the university and my knowledge is not enough to understand all of it."
