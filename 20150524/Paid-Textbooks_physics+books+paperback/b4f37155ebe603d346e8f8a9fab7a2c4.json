                "Text": "The Feynman Lectures deserve their status as classics, bringing novel insights and clarity even to topics that one would think ancient and musty (e.g. his exposition of radio waves). I'm not sure I would recommend them as undergraduate texts, since there may be too much wizardry where the solutions depend on deep insights or unexpected symmetries, with perhaps too few examples of brute calculation and no exercises to be worked by the student. However, they are unsurpassed when used to supplement the usual treatments or just to appreciate the beauty of the subject. For some reason, I never had the same feeling toward Volume III (Quantum Mechanics). In part, I think this is because he was trying too hard to reconcile the usual Schroedinger description with his own version of Quantum Mechanics, namely the least action/ path integral approach used in this text. Without the same constraint here (although he does very elegantly derive the wave equation from the least action principle), I experienced the same sense of wonder and awe that I felt from his earlier treatment of mechanics and electricity/magnetism. Although it's only my personal opinion, I would recommend this as the true successor to volumes I and II of the Lectures."

Written by Feynman himself, this book explains the path integral approach to quantum mechanics in a way that is understandable to every beginning quantum mechanic. Path integrals are integral (sorry, bad English) to the study of quantum field theory and string theory, and you must be a master at it if you would like to work in either of these fields. Purchase this book at once and start working!"

                "Text": "This book is the outgrowth of a class Richard Feynman taught to undergraduates. It is designed to present an alternative approach to looking at and understanding quantum mechanics from the usual first approach taught to undergraduates, namely focussing on solving the Schrodinger equation. As such it presupposes some familiarity already at the undergraduate level with both classical and quantum mechanics and the associated mathematical necessities. If you have this background, I think you will find this book to be a very interesting read. If you don't, you'll probably quickly become frustrated, since it makes no pretensions about being comprehensive or complete. It presents a point of view which as the author points out in the Preface is complementary (no pun intended) to other ways of understanding quantum mechanics. Some aspects of QM are more easily understood using this approach, others are not. As Feynman once said, any theoretical physicist worth her salt will have at her disposal several different ways of approaching a problem, and will select the one that is most useful for each problem. The path integral approach is just one arrow in the quiver, albeit a very important one."

                "Text": "In the early 1940s Richard Feynman was presented with a comment made by an older physicist P.A.M. Dirac. In response to that comment Feynman asked, \"What is the use of that?\" Feynman answered his own question in a way that ultimately led to him being universally considered as the greatest physicist of the second half of the 20th century. Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals expands on that answer he gave and discusses the core of his work leading ultimately to his Nobel Prize in physics in 1965. This book is a classic that could only be written by the master himself. So what is the use of this book? It introduces the reader to a substantial portion of modern physics."

But it is of interest to historians and philosophers of science for a different reason:  It presents a model for the foundations of physics in which determinism is conspicuous by its absence, and in which that determinism emerges back in classical mechanics via phenomena of large numbers (just as many other concepts of classical mechanics emerge from quantum mechanics)."
