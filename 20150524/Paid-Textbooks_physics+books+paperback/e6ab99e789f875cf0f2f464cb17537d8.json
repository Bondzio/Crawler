                "Text": "I found this book very helpful in understanding QM. I am a graduate student and the material covered in this volume worked very well with Shankar. The course uses Shankar, but I have trouble keeping up with him, I easily get lost on the point because he is rather wordy and doesn't skip as many steps. Park's book gets more to the point and I don't get lost on what is going on. I have found that some of his chapters really help to clear my confusion of topics in Shankar. I read this book first, as an introduction, then delve into Shankar. It has helped me immensely."

                "Text": "I think this book would be great for a first undergraduate course in quantum mechanics or even an introduction to modern  physics if supplemented with an intro to special relativity. Really covers all the basics from the Schroedinger viewpoint though the Dirac notation is introduced around p. 140. What's unique about this text is the applications which spur interest. For example Gamow's theory of alpha decay which gave evidence for the validity of quantum mechanics is presented as an application of the WKB method. It also relates half-life to quantum mechanical parameters. Also a derivation of the Richardson-Dushman equation is done as an application of statistical mechanics. Lotsa neat stuff!"
