Whether you are a phycisist, mathematician or engineer, it provides a solid  basis for the problems encountered. Further comment is not needed - just  consider how often this book is referenced to in scientific publications!"

                "Text": "okay, this book is highly utilized by a great deal of people in the field, but i find the book lacking in readability. It generalizes far too much. It gives too little detail. It reminds me of an outline for a scattering text book. It is a reference text in the truest sense of the word. It's obvious intent is a reminder for those who already know the information, but it is so generalized...it alone is not very useful for the student learning scattering."
