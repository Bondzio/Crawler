                "Text": "Like a lot of ultrasound techs in this country we can not go to a class to learn ultrasound physics, we have to teach ourselves. I found this book and excellent compliment to Edelmans physic book. It was more technical than the SPI exam but found studying from both sources invaluble. The biggest part of passing the SPI exam is understanding the relationships of the various sound wave componets and how when one factor is changed how does this effect the other. This book really helped!!!(For the version of SPI I took 12/2009 the were no equation questions  - just when one factor changes what happens to the other - so you do have to know the equations but no need for absolute math.)"

                "Text": "With this short book, you can save a lot of effort. If you do not know any thing about physics, you have to read every word. But later on, you ONLY read those tables in each page to get the information directly with important questions and answer. By this way you can review the whole book before examination in one hour. I have passed the SPI test with score 680 (the passing score is 555)."

Since reading the book, I have come to use more of the 'advanced' features of my ultrasound and Doppler devices. It is also a good resource for the students that rotate through our service every month. I recommend it highly to every vascular specialist, RVT, RDMS, etc."
