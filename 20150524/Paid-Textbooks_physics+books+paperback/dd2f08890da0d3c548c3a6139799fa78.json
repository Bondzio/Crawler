                "Text": "No one could read the first chapter and not finish this book!  I savored every page of it from start to finish.  Brian Greene has a unique combination of talent that you JUST DON'T SEE in such an outstanding scientific mind.  1) He can write!  2) He is clearly one of the top physicists in the field of Superstring/M-Theory.  3) He is a born teacher.  4) Did I mention he can write?  Through brilliant use of analogy, Greene makes the most mind boggling concepts easy to grasp.  This is a book for lay people, as evidenced by the absence of equations in the text...they are included in the notes section at the end along with more robust theoretical details.  The book takes you through the usual history of quantum physics and cosmology, as it must do to provide the background necessary to understand where we are now.  He moves from the earlier understandings to the most current developments in a manner that makes very difficult subjects accessible to everyday people.  The question of why the arrow of times moves relentlessly forward is answered in this book, and that is no mean accomplishment.  In fact, the infusion of knowledge is so gentle that after 500 pages I was amazed at how much was covered and even more amazed that I understood it.  The subject matter itself is fascinating.  Greene's writing ability makes it enjoyable at the same time.  His injection of humor put the icing on the cake.  A small example: \"...Ordinary experience confronts us with two types of phenomena: those that have a clearly delineated beginning, middle, and end...and those that are cyclic, happening over and over again (the changing seasons, the rising and setting of the sun, Larry King's weddings).\"  Now some might find his highly imaginative analogies can get a bit corny, but I saw them as brilliant--and they do the job of illuminating complex ideas.  I really can't recommend this book highly enough to those who want to learn!  One last thing...you can read the whole book without consulting the notes at the end.  This is great for continuity and readability.  Just don't fail to read the \"Notes\" section when you finish.  It serves as a brief refresher to cement the new ideas into your head, and expands on the more complicated concepts.  Whatever happened to the 10-star ratings?  5 stars are not enough!"

                "Text": "This book answers questions that I never even knew enough to ask. It broadens the mind and makes physics and the mysteries of the universe accessible, even to me, a nonscientist. I'd never heard about quantum entanglement (distant things influencing each other without anything travelling between them) and the discussion was so thrilling that that chapter alone was worth the price of the book. There is so much here, cosmology, M theory, universes on branes but the author pulls it all together in a totally coherent and entertaining way. Physics is developing rapidly and this book provides a foundation for understanding today's breakthroughs. It's a great read."

                "Text": "I thought The Elegant Universe was an excellent book. But without any science background, I must admit that I found it a difficult read. I got alot out of it, but frankly, I kind of skimmed the last third. My experience with The Fabric of the Cosmos has been very different. I just got it a couple of days ago, and I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book, cover to cover and it was *amazing*. I was blown away. The book has a wonderful--and wonderfully unexpected--feel, quite different really from The Elegant Universe. Yes, Brian Greene's trademarks suffuse the text: It is challenging, engaging, compelling, and at times very funny. But this book does far more than open the mind to the stunning insights revealed in recent by physicists. It shows how physics is rewriting the rules of reality and how so much of what we take for granted is, in fact, an illusion borne of misleading qualities of human perception. This book tears down misconception after misconception and reveals a deeper level of reality than I ever imagined existed. This is one of those rare books that provides a life altering experience."

                "Text": "This book made me wish I was a physicist! I'm an economist by training, with no physics background--and now I'm an enthusiast of M-Theory!  I got on this quantum mechanics kick after reading Bill Bryson: \"A History of Nearly Everything.\"  Since then, I've read all of Hawking (horrible writer, not worth the time), biographies of Newton and Einstein, and Green's other great book, The Elegant Universe.  However, this book should be required reading!  His ability to give clear and consistent analogies for incredibly complex concepts is cunning.  I especially liked his repeated, and successful, attempts to explain what is important, and why, and reminding the reader when the eyes start to gloss over.  It's almost as if he knows you've just got lost, and brings you back to where he's trying to take you.  He is also a master at building on successive, complicated concepts, and literally \"threads\" you through the book, one stitch and sentence at a time, with each new idea.  While some of his details on experiments can seem tedious, I respect these attempts as he tries to explain the significance of grounding outlandish concepts in down-to-earth observable experiments and realities.  Take your time reading it.  I understand probably just 40-60% of what he wrote, at best, but I'm still blown away.  Enjoyable for everyone."

                "Text": "This may be the best written science book I have ever read.  It has all the qualities of good science writing:  it is carefully organized;  it has an implicit model of what the reader will be able to comprehend, and warns the reader when some material is perhaps too difficult, as well as making good use of footnotes; it fairly discusses issues which have not been settled, making clear where the author stands; it is up to date; it has a sense of humor and a lively style.  What makes this book absolutely stand out, is its brilliant use of metaphor and image, both word images and illustrations.  Having said all that, I am not particularly motivated to read other books in the same subject area:  while Greene provides the reader with a real feel for the material, the understanding is necessarily superficial. In fact, I was happier with the latter, more exotic,  part of the book than with the earlier more familiar material about relativity: Greene even got me comfortable with 4 and more dimensions of space.  And it was nice to read, for my sanity, that all forces are implemented via actual movement of particles of force, be it photons or gravitrons (which Greene is certain exist and will be observed as our tools get better, and he is not prone to being dogmatic). One warning: for some reason, Green unaccountably delays mentioning that the probability concept used by quantum physicists does not really track conventional interpretations, wherein probabilities, being non-zero, cannot cancel each other."

There are many deeply sophisticated ideas offered up here and I appreciate Greene taking the time away from his research to offer help for the rest of us who would like to catch a glimpse of his view of the cosmos.  The detailed notes at the end of the book are nearly a second book in themselves and despite having read many other books on these topics there was much freshness in Greenes approach as well as some new angles I had not encountered before.  It would take a severely jaded person to fail to appreciate the wealth of material presented here.  However the reader must be prepared to think carefully and bring some serious mental exertion to the table.  Understanding the cosmos does not come free or easy; the effort is certainly worth it. I was impressed that the author really did draw distinctions between what is solidly known vs where the contemporary uncertainties lie.  Study the footnotes at the end of the book - carefully!"

                "Text": "This book a radiant gem. It provides an uncompromsing tour through modern physics. It is the best science book I've ever read. Personally, I even liked it a bit more than Elegant Universe because the material strives deeper into the foundations of accepted physics, rather than heading straight for theories that are so far without experimental verification. There is some superficial overlap with Elegant Universe (both books need to lay the foundation of relativity and the quantum) but very different concerns are central to the discussion in this book. Everything Greene discusses here is geared toward shining as bright a light on space and time as one can. Unification (the topic of The Elegant Universe) comes into the late chapters, but not as an end into and of itself, instead, as part of the newest views on space and time. If you are ready to examine the reality you experience and have your preconceptions challenged, you are ready for the adventure this book brings."

We take time for granted as some kind of matrix that life just systematically unfolds in, but why? I am not a scientist interested in the equations behind these discoveries, but a avid fan of science and the inspiration to be found in scientific inquiry. For a amature like me, Fabric of the Cosmos delivers information, ideas and inspiration in abundance."

Brian Greene does a remarkable thing in both The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos -- he manages to engage his reader with discovery and inquiry that teases us into our own imaginings. Of course there are similarities -- only so far as too remind us where we were and where we are -- but treat yourself. Read past the first two chapters. Theories built on years with a piece of chalk and a blackboard that expand our understanding of the nature of reality? This guy is gold!"

The material is mind stretching, the ideas tough to grasp, but the journey this book takes you on is worth the effort. Hugely worth the effort. With this author's masterful handholding, his constant attention to making the material as accessible as it possibly can be, you can go far from conventional ideas of how the universe works. Where was Mr. Greene when I was a student?? This is how science should be taught. With artful analogies and great little stories, you learn so much from this book."

I don't think most people who read this type of book care to have physics related to television.  Green repeats himself and treats the reader as if they are mentally handicapped.  I enjoyed the book because I love the topic; however, I found it necessary to skip a few sections."

The Fabric of the Cosmos  is well written, the ideas are clearly explained and it gives an excellent summary of Cosmology's  theories up to date.  It describes how physicists work and develop one idea after another in their search for a final explanation.  Apparently, the more scientists try to understand reality, the harder it gets.  Greeene shows the various attempts to understand modern String Theories as they try to connect Einstein's General  Relativity and quantum field theories.  Greene describes how these theories try to explain the origin and evolution of the universe and the tremendous mathematical and conceptual challenges scientists face today.  It seems clear that  Twenty First Century Physics will require the cooperation of many Einsteins exchanging ideas and working together trying  different approaches.  To me the FAbric of the Cosmos also suggests that that in the absence of experimental data, physicists have to refrain from talking like Theologians who instead of the Bible use mathematical symbolism."

Even the explanation of string theory made some sense. Only when we get to the discussion of branes did things start to break down, but I don't know whether that was due to my lack of attention or to the author's failure to communicate branes as well as strings.

The world of physicists have not stopped discovering and Greene makes a reasonable effort to explain these advances in non-mathematic terminology.  His style is quite readable, though at times trite.  Certainly, the many references to the Simpsons, Star Trek and X-Files confirm his status as a geek.  I found his review of physics (from Newton to Einstein) valuable.  I admit that his explanation of multidimensional m-theory looses me at a certain point, but I assume that some of these ideas are best experienced as mathematic entities.  It is hard to visualize 10 dimensions!  I don't know of any contemporary physicist who has come close to explaining cosmology in such an accessible manner.  E.g., Greene makes Sagan look infantile in his accomplishments.  I would recommend this book to anyone with a college level background- it will be to abstract for most others.  PhDs in physics will be better served reading the original scientific literature.  I thought this book was better than his first book, since it dealt with a broader subject.  Finally, while I have no idea if Greene is really an important scientist in his field, he is certainly an accomplished communicator and writer and his students are undoubtedly lucky to have him."

In short, I conclude and suggest that this is a must read book even for non starters as it chronologically assembles the concepts that need to be well understood to learn the scientific reality."

                "Text": "I read with relish Greene's earlier work, The Elegant Universe, and had the experience of learning something new in almost every sentence. The Fabric of the Cosmos lived up to the precedent set in its predecessor. Rather than merely repeat information in The Elegant Universe, it deepened my understanding of the topics covered in the previous work. I absolutely love this book and consider the method of presentation to be the perfect balance between scholarly and accessible. That is, Greene does an excellent job of presenting a pretty arcane topic in language accessible to the public. I've never taken a physics course in my life and was able to understand the concepts presented because of his own insight as well as his creativity in fashioning analogies. I recommend this book to any lay person who wants a better understanding of what goes on in the universe at the quantum level."

Using a fun loving style and upbeat tone, Greene employs popular iconic characters from classic Americana to teach.  Mulder and Scully, Bart and Lisa, Homer and Marge have never worked together so well. For those, who like me are Physics and Mathematically ignorant, this book will indeed be a fun and educating read.  I found chapter four, dealing with the phenomona of Quantum Entanglement and the Non-Local nature of Quantum theory, especially enlightening.  Greene's description of Inflationary Expansion in the Big Bang model of the beginning of the Universe was clear even to me. I look forward to reading Greene's other book \"The Elegant Universe\" to learn even more about Super-string and M-Theory.  This book is worth reading."

The observer who considers the phenomena in different reference frames troubles me in the current understanding of the universe.  The fabric of the reference frame and the origin of the observer are uncertain. The appearance of life and thinking creatures is mysterious. It is very likely that the observer complicates the picture of reality as he develops it in his mind. You will find observer independent, based only on the discovered properties of existence, qualitatively new texture of reality that also includes the phenomenon of consciousness in the book Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything by Eugene Savov."

Anyone looking for 'Quantum Physics for Dummies' will be ill-served by this work, which retains a high register of intellectual and theoretic discourse. Greene is generally quite dry, except where he brings examples into the context of \"The Simpsons.\" This book is comprehensive, detailing the history and theory of quantum mechanics, string theory, etc. There is a detailed section on time travel near the end, which was a great way to end the work. Several key insights (like the discover of the Higgs boson) have made the work slightly outdated. Overall, it's solid!"

Space and time have been hashed out over and over by leading writers and scientists for decades but nothing reads like Brian Greene and no one expands and advances as much. This is a step forward and I only wished Brian will get the attention Carl Sagan had to bring the world a wonderful and helpful awareness as this goes seriously beyond Sagan. This is surely Needed forward thinking with applied advancing thought for anyone reading. Much new material is discussed that I havnt encountered anywhere else, discussions that details superstings, other theories, and many good illistrations which aid the reader. The book is not overly complicated and will not leave the novice waivering, a Junior High School student can get seriously and easily engrossed in The Fabric of the Cosmos. I do seriously recommend prereading a fine book on the cosmos fabric, big bang, and time direction which will aid in understanding this, SB 1 or God by Maddox."

                "Text": "It will blow your mind but... in a good and healthy way. First of all, I love Brian Greene's work at Columbia University. I first fell in love with his \"Elegant Universe\" (2000) where he so eloquently discusses 'String theory,' a large piece of quantum physics theory, and now his \"Fabric of The Cosmos\" (2005), followed up with a recent special on Nova (2011) under the same name. The great things about Prof. Brian Greene is that he doesn't hold back. The amazing things here is that he blows your mind with sheer possibilities in how the universe - multiverse theory works. In light of this, there's a great new book out called \"Seven At The Sevens\" (2012) that plays on this multiverse theory and with the clever use of fiction, has the ghost of Walt Whitman coming back as \"The Good Gray Ghost\" to assist a group of writers in Boston. It's awesome. Both books are awesome. In fact, there are lines in Whitman's \"Song of Myself\" (Leaves of Grass, 1855) that are more than quantum physics like and are eerily similar to Greene's quantum physics theory in that all of us, including Whitman could be in more than one universe simultaneously. Perhaps... in hundreds of thousands simultaneously. And, the degree or distance that separates us could be very small. And, Yes... this could also mean that Walt Whitman is both dead and alive at the same time but distributed in many many universes hence the multverse theory."

He touches briefly on string theory and M-theory but I found his explanations a little harder to digest than Brian Greene's. This book explains in sufficient detail the concepts behind String Theory, Quantum Mechanics, and M-theory and the implications they have on our concept of reality, space, and time. I have not read \"The Elegant Universe\" yet but I do plan on picking it up and reading through it because of the way the author conveys the complex and hard to understand ideas. It's impossible to fully comprehend a 11-dimensional reality, especially since our brains have only evolved to understand 3 space and 1 time dimension but I think his explanation has gotten me the closest to full comprehension as possible. I look forward to reading more of his books."

I also clarified my grasp of Einstein's relativity - especially the concept that one's moving at near light-speed will slow time.  I don't get along with math above the algebra level, so this all-verbal approach to explaining current theoretical physics is critical for me.  Toward the end, he spends some time theorizing about time-travel and worm-holes which I consider science-fantasy, but following that there is a final analysis of some additional aspects of string theory that I found informative.  There is a good chance that I will not live to see a final determination on the applicability of string theory to the fabric of the universe, so I appreciate any opportunity to get a better grasp on it while I can."

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Brian Greene is scrupulous about clarity, and has a gift for metaphor that makes it possible for him to discuss even the most abstruse, esoteric physics with skill, clarity and wit. Readers will discover baffling wonders that flatly contradict ordinary quotidian experience, and will come to realize that what they perceive as real is anything but real. Moreover, they will learn that physicists seem to have a great deal more success at demonstrating what is not real than at discovering what is. The most commonplace things - the difference between yesterday and tomorrow, between here and there - continue to baffle the greatest minds in science. Now you can begin to understand why."

It's not that the material isn't interesting, because it definitely is and it really gets you thinking, but i wasn't nearly impressed as i thought i would be. I get that this book is meant to appeal to a broader audience but even then i think it makes the material much more difficult and complicated than it has to be, and that's ironic given how much the book tries to baby you with borderline irrelevant examples and an overdose of explanations. From the superfluity and redundancy to the lack of clarity he seems to have a great deal of trouble getting his point across. I understand this isn't exactly trivial stuff but i honestly think he could've gotten all his points across in a book 1/4 the size. I think it's much more impressive to see someone explain a concept in the simplest way possible, than it is to write a whole novel on something explained in a couple pages. I also think Greene assumes a bit too much in this book. We don't know the true nature of reality, anyone that says we do is lying. I get that most of what he's saying is backed by popular scientific belief but he doesn't have to speak as if nothing is up to interpretation or scrutiny. I'd be much happier if he simply told us about the results of various experiment, rather than what they imply without knowing the complete picture yet. We're allowed to have our own opinions on things because until we've figured out reality, no one is dead wrong and no one is dead right. Those smart enough will probably be able to think for themselves anyway but i'm a bit disappointed at how confidently he tells a story to vulnerable minds, that he himself must surely be able to admit might not be true. It's not all bad, he brings up many interesting things, there's some parts though that are just very inconcise and possibly misleading."

                "Text": "The recent discovery of what may be the Higgs boson made me aware again of how little I understand about the universe. Or even about the questions now being posed by cosmologists. Greene makes it all about as clear as it can possibly be to someone -- like me -- who can't follow the math. For those who can follow it, he offers many of the necessary equations in the endnotes, which also include numerous references for further reading. To substitute for the math, Greene uses metaphors, generally pretty silly ones -- Bart Simpson on a supersonic skateboard, for example -- that at least give us an idea of, for example, what Einstein meant about space-time in the general theory of relativity. And then beyond Einstein, to quantum mechanics, and why the world and the whole universe appear to us in only three space dimensions (forward and back, side to side, up and down) and one time dimension, when quantum theory, confirmed experimentally, demonstrates that there must be ten space dimensions (but still only one time dimension). Is our universe really a kind of hologram projected by forces outside it, that is, beyond the universe we are capable of perceiving directly? Could be; Greene considers that hypothesis as at least plausible. And how did it all, everything, begin? Or did it? Was the Big Bang, the initial expansion of matter and energy that set everything in motion, just a new configuration of energy that is always, and that therefore may have been dispersed in some other entropic system(s), and may again -- if our universe ever reaches the limit of its continuing expansion -- shrink to extreme density, preparatory to a new explosion (\"Big Bang\") some billions of years hence? It took me weeks to get through this book, not because it was unclear, but because the news about the universe seemed so strange, so oddly contrary to our ordinary experience, that I had to keep checking back to re-understand parts of earlier chapters necessary for following the later ones. I remain amazed, and inspired with new speculations about philosophy and existence and what we do and cannot know. Guess it's time for me to learn some math."

For instance, another universe, a 3-brane, just a millimeter from ours! Great -- why a millimeter, why not a foot? What does that kind of closeness mean? Suppose it was farther? And what does a parallel universe mean anyway? Another universe the same size, or shape, or with similar laws, or what? And how could it be that close w/o its matter somehow interacting with ours? This is just one example of him introducing something really fascinating, and talking *around* it in depth w/o every telling you what it means or how to think about it, or what it means to our conception of the universe/existence. He also has a disturbing habit of talking about the most arcane subjects an then zooming out to use a horrifically simplistic analogy which he never returns to, something like talking extensively about the most confounding aspects of gravity and gravity waves/particles and then suddenly summing it all up with \"it's as if this universe was a stretched piece of 3-dimensional fabric that stretches with gravity.\" Okay, but does that metaphor have any other implications? What does it mean that it's a fabric? In a sense, I wish Hawking had written this, because he really seems invested in explaining how these breakthroughs influence how we understand the human condition being situated in this particular reality.  That having been said, he packs a lot in, and I'm buying his other book because he's one of the better writers on this stuff out there. Beware, but enjoy!"

It gives a detailed, although totally non-mathematical, account of the great, stunning successes of modern cosmology.  It gives a clear and sensible lay introduction to string theory, and it does so in a reliably correct way.  If we read for the content, then, this book is of first importance.  I consider it compulsory reading.  On the down side, the craftsmanship of the writing itself seems less appealing.  Early in the book, the author discusses particle-wave duality in quantum mechanics at some length.  For me, at least, both Kroemer and Feynman give much better accounts of this important material.  Undoubtedly the author is entirely familiar with both, and I am not sure why his account seems more confused and, perhaps, more confusing than theirs.  Finally, it seems that the book was written very quickly.  Although extensive editing would have been required, it could have been much more concise and much clearer at the same time.  Still, if I want a book from a busy professor active in research---and I do want that---then I have to tolerate quick writing, don't I?  This is a great book to read, but it has no place on my permanent shelf.  Kroemer does."

(It's hard to believe that Seth McFarlane, the man behind Family Guy, is one of the producers of the new Cosmos. I'm still waiting for Stewie to show up, or for a Cosmos parody on Family Guy. But I digress.) Like Carl Sagan and Neil Degrasse Tyson on Cosmos, Brian Greene is attempting to make science understandable to those of us who don't have advanced science degrees. Dr Greene uses a lot of pop culture references to illustrate his points. He seems to have a special fondness for the Simpsons. It's a little more complex, though. He's trying to explain the basics of string theory, with its theories of 10-dimensional space and quantum lengths. It can be a little slow going at times. He saves most of the mathematical equations for the footnotes. I'm not sure it's fully understandable to everyone. I had trouble with it myself. Some updates from the text. The large Hadron collider was finished, and the Higgs particle was discovered. Also, scientists recently discovered ripples from the original big bang. Dr Greene knows about pop culture. (He's appeared on the TV show The Big Bang Theory making fun of himself.) He does well in this book. It's just the subject matter that can be daunting."

Clearly they are referring to some of the analogies Brian Green used to describe certain theories, some including characters from \"The Simpsons\" ect, however it doesn't take away from the fact that he goes on to fully explain everything as well.  Also you can read the footnotes (which I did) for an even more in-depth read.  The whole time I read this book I had a childish grin on my face in reaction to the amazing things being uncovered by cutting edge science, and the author has a way of painting a mental picture for you that makes it that much more enjoyable.  I actually enjoyed this book a bit more than \"The Elegant Universe\" because of the colorful descriptions, and the way he would build up the descriptions to a reveal.  It doesn't read like a text book, while including all the information of one.  Very informative, and more importantly very, very enjoyable to read!"

Yes it covers alot of the same material, but it is explained much better from a beginners point of view. The best way to simplify a complicated subject is through the use of analogies, and there are plenty in this book. Having read both books I now have a much more solid understanding of relativity, quantum mechanics..etc. than I did after reading The Elegant Universe alone. I may now go back and re-read Elegant Universe since I have a better foundation. If you are like me and have no background or very little formal education on the subject of Physics, then read this book first. No prior knowledge is required. Well done Briane Greene."

The first 70-80 pages explain the history of physics, so if you're already familiar with it, you can skip along. Brian Greene uses many methods to explain very complicated topics, and at some points even admits that certain words (such as high/low entropy) still confuse him, which makes him seem more like a down-to-earth person. At some points certain explanations can get a little verbose, but it's better that he says too much than too little. This book allows anyone at a high-school to college reading level to delve into some of the most cutting edge topics in physics and quantum mechanics, without understanding all of the complicated mathematical formulas. He does however include most of the formulas in a notes section with an explanation of the formula, for the mathematically inclined."

Greene explains the progression of the discoveries and often tells something about the personalities of the discoverers.  The companion PBS TV show is also beautifully done."

Using the easy to understand spinning bucket experiment as an intellectual lifeline Green helps us explore the deep and turbulent waters of cosmology and particle physics and brings us back safely to soild ground without resorting to a single mathematical equation. There is a disappointment, however. Green either does not know, or has overlooked striking parallels between string theory and cosmology as described in Sankhya, an ancient Indian school of philosophy. He does mention 'Purusha', which is a Sankhya term, but refers to it in a somewhat prejorative sense, and misses some of the the more refined aspects of the Sankhya school of thought. The big bang (hiranyagarbha) his M-branes describing an ever expanding and contracting universe (mahayugas), and string theory itself (paranada) have qualitative intellectual parallels in Sankhya. I would hope the author would seriously consider this matter and not be spooked by the unfamiliar Sanskrit jargon of Sankhya. Overall, great book, a must read!"

I just think that he lays the analogies on way too thick, such that they break down, and distract more than they are worth. Quantum entanglement is simply bizarre, and notions of multiple universes are mind-boggling. I definitely like hearing about how some of these possibilities may be discovered experimentally soon, which leaves some scientific hope, and makes me want to switch studies and pursue physics---unlike the author's mother (at least in this universe)."

Concepts are well explained and fairly easy to grasp (as easy as it gets considering the complexity and alien nature of many of these concepts). This book is not the only reading you will need to fully understand the subjects, but it is an excellent start. Overall: VERY GOOD!"

The book is very in depth for the most part, and very good analogies and visual descriptions of abstract concepts help the reader understand many concepts. I very much like the way Brian presents the topic, he lets you know what other theories there are for a given topic, where he stands on it in comparison to the current consensus (if there is one). I've been reading physics alot lately and this is by far the best book i've read on the topic that goes into sufficient detail."

Our quest for an understanding of our spiritual interests and how those might merge with our understanding of the physical universe make a philosophy of physics essential reading. Have a look at a new book: Mathias Frisch, Inconsistency, Asymmetry, and Non-Locality: A Philosophical Investigation of Classical Electrodynamics, Oxford University Press, 2005, as a comparison. There are new ideas in this book not discussed in Elegant and those are the philosophical implications of current physics. I find these rarely discussed though maybe it is because I miss them in the physics. I admit to needing them in simpler terms! Frozen River as a metaphor for time -- for example, is wonderfully simple and requires no physics speak for me to comprehend. I love the book."

                "Text": "Like many other readers of The Fabric of the Cosmos, who thought of this book as a \"sequel\" to The Elegant Universe, I was disappointed. Personally, I liked the first chapter, where he discusses the point of view of many physicists, like Newton, Mach and Einstein. The first half of this book is based on well-established physical theories (particularly, Quantum Mechanics and Special/General Relativity, which, by the way, have already been experimentally tested many times).  BUT, he spent (or wasted) the second part of his book on speculations on String/M theory, and, OK, we understand Grenne is a string physicist, but it seems he forgets that UNTIL TODAY, THERE IS NO EXPERIMENTAL PROOF SUPPORTING STRING THEORY (or Higgs Field, Braneworlds, wormholes, etc). So it IS senseless to speculate about a speculative theory, or even worse, to try to get conclusions about our reality from it. The author tends to sell phrases such as \"many researchers think that...\" (with no references at all), which are written just to overweigh the real content of his arguments. I agree with other reviewers: his pop-culture analogies just insult the inteligence of the readers. To the readers who were disappointed by this childish book, I would recommend to them DEL MUNDO CU\u00c1NTICO AL UNIVERSO EN EXPANSI\u00d3N (From the Quantum World to the Expanding Universe) from Shahen Hacyan, and HOYOS NEGROS Y LA CURVATURA DEL ESPACIO-TIEMPO (Black Holes and the Curvature of Space-Time) also from the same author (FCE, M\u00e9xico), to read a well-written, general level book about Quantum Theory, Inflationary Theory, Black Holes and Wormholes (they are written in Spanish, though). Let's not forget Complex Systems and Chaos Theory, which (many researchers agree :-P) is thought to the third revolution on physics of the twentieth century. This is another problem for determinist theories (for long-term predictions infinite precision is needed in order to avoid chaotic behavior of physical systems)... and our fellow Brian Greene just ignored it on this book."

It is hard to digest the mysterious intense stars formation in the early universe, the unanticipated location of the quasars in humble homes and the discovery of huge (about 80 times heavier than the sun) stars that orbit each other in just 3.7 days. These brain twisters can find surprisingly elegant clarification in the \"firework universe\", described by Eugene Savov in his book Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything.

If you are math savy this will be a great read. If you aren't than you may quickly become dissatisfied with the book . It refers to ther formulas through out the book.. good luck, best of reading.
