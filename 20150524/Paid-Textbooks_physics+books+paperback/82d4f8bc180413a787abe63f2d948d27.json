                "Text": "This is one of the better textbooks for introductory Physics for science majors. Halliday, Resnick and Walker's emphasizes on problem solvings; Serway's makes great balance between concepts and applications; Giancoli's is more conceptual oriented; Young and Freedman's has a lot of excellent problems and explains concepts very well; Tipler's is quite boring and concise. It's always nice to read a newly published classical physics textbook to see how the same subject is presented differently by the different authors. But since this book emphasizes the practical aspects of physics, it's probably more welcome than the others for a college level cal based introductory physics course. There is a complete Answer book to the problems that I found quite helpful. Problems are pretty much the same for all the editions. ISBN-10: 039395756X, ISBN-13: 9780393957563"

                "Text": "It's a good book with a lot of examples, but not intuitive and some answers are not explained in detail. Some math work is left for the student to figure out so if you are not that good or don't remember your algebra and calculus, you may need to catch up along the way. Great companion for MIT courseware for Physics."

                "Text": "I had to use this book for my Engineering Physics 1 class. I found that it will cover all the material that's presented in class, but not deeply enough to solve difficult problems. It will essentially tell you all the formulas that you need, but leave you to put together how it fits with your problems. Also some derivations of equations sometimes lack explanation and aren't very intuitive (for example it took me a while to understand how the equation for center of mass for a uniform solid was found). However the checkups at the end of each section are a good way to see if you conceptually understand the material. But overall you may need to refer to other resources to find all the information you need."

The explanations are very good and easy to follow, and I found that you can pretty much read the textbook while working the examples and get a pretty good understanding of what's going on. The problems range from easy to the difficult side of medium. If you want some really challenging physics problems, go check out Problems in General Physics by Irodov."
