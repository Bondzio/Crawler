                "Text": "Max Jammer's books are characterized by a formidable skill of presentation of complex subjects in science, always built on a sound understanding of mathematics and the technical aspects of his subject, but readily accessible to the interested reader.  This is one of the most fundamental of his works, and very rewarding reading."
