                "Text": "Summed up, in my younger high school years this book guided me through my ponderings of the world and helped point me in a direction which has essentially shaped who I am today, a rational, yet questioning individual which is also what Mr. Jeans I think tries to accomplish with this writing. decades ahead of it's time, Sir. James Jeans talks of the foundational limitations of newtonian  (clock-work like) physics as well as quantum level physics as if it was being studied like it is today. James Jeans' book is a remarkable triumph of non-fiction literature by being able to describe the uses and limitations of deep-lying mathematical concepts in almost strictly non-mathematical language. A truly elegant work!"

                "Text": "As a student studying physics and philosophy this is one of the best books I've read.  Jeans gives a great survey of modern physic and modern philosophy  (I've used this book as a reference several times this semester to clear up some issues since I am taking both modern physics and modern philosophy!) and draws great conclusions from both of them.  The book is a wonderful read, a lot of good information but still very enjoyable.  Overall one of my favorite books."
