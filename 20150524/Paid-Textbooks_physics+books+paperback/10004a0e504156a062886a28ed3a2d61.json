                "Text": "I'm a senior in high school and I bought this book along with the princeton review one. I use both for extra practice problems and test prep for class tests. Also this is the first year physics c is offered at my school, so if there's something my teacher can't explain, these books can. I didn't notice major errors or typos, but the way the material is described can be a little confusing at times. The practice problems are great prep for the \"weird\" problems on the ap exam. 4 out of 5 because the material is presented as crisply as Princeton review, but the practice tests are useful for both the class and the ap exam."

                "Text": "I believe this book is good for people who know very basic ideas of Physics C topics.  If you know the topics pretty well, but just need a refresher, don't buy this book.  The explanations in this book are more detailed than my textbook (Tipler's Physics for Scientists and Engineers).  For example, I just wanted to review Simple Harmonic Motion and the various equations that go with it. I found myself more confused with the book going into many different equations for k-effective."
