The clear diagrams and helpful descriptions throughout the book allowed my English-major intellect to quickly grasp physics at an advanced level. I'm now scoring nearly perfect on practice tests."

                "Text": "I believe this book really helped me for the SAT II. I took a year of physics in school, but never really felt like I grasped the content until buying this book. It reviews every single thing that will be on the SAT II, and provides practice problems for each section and practice tests with answers explained and score tables. The Barron's book clarifies the material and makes the content easy to grasp. This book provided every formula and piece of information I needed for the test, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be successful on the SAT II."

This book's practice tests are great examples of what you will see on the actual exam, and helped me score an 800 (perfect score) on the SAT Physics Exam."
