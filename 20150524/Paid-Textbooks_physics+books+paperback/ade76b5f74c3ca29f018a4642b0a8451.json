                "Text": "This book is not easily comprehended to those new to physics.  Generally speaking, the \"Six Ideas\" series is overly verbose and typical of the kinds of textbooks that take pride in making things so complex that it isolates students and simply refuses to describe any of these phenomenons in plain english.  Sadly, Unit N is the best written of the \"Six Ideas\" series.  I would attribute the success in my physics class to my excellent teacher and resources beyond this horrible series of books."
