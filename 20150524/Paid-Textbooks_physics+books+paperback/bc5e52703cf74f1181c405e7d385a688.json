If you want physical insight and understanding you must look elsewhere (god knows where?). All  derivations start with some random non-fundamental formula and ends in  another. Clarity and coherence seem far away."

But by no means, it serves as an introductory text (as the title says). You need to be an advanced reader already having enough experience with quantum transport."
