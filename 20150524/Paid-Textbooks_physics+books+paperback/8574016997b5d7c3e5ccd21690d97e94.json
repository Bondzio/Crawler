I train k-12 science teachers and it is great to be able to dig a little deeper on various topics and be able to prepare for all sorts of questions.  Also, I am sure many people have wondered why various phenomena occur and it is great to have some insights into them.  Highly recommend this book!!"

Even some of the items I knew well like light polarization upon reflection  were presented in a fresh light. Perhaps the best explication for me was the discussion of how an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane led to an increased emissivity."
