Following the first chapter, lemma's and theorem's explained in the precise and concise fashion. And individuals with background in mathematics and in particular physics are the primary beneficiaries of this book. The thing that I enjoyed most were the related problem's at the end, as the theory of Bessel functions fully lay on the table along with related exercise and APPLICATIONS. As a physicist I have ever hardy encounter any simple book but yet effective. Highly recommended."
