                "Text": "This review is written from the point of view of a philospher, poorly trained in mathematics, but still wanting to get to the meat of quantum mechanics from a methematical point of view.  Wow.  In this book I found what I thought I never would.  It describes the mathematical world of quantum physics using the majestic simplicity of matrices and the algebra of complex numbers.  As the author states in the preface, no calculus or trigonometry is required. While the math isn't downright simple, neither is beyond the grasp of someone who is bright, but hasn't taken claculus or even precalc.  For those who want to journey past this book another excellent intro level quantum mechanics text that introduces wave mechanics and  does assume a knowledge of basic calculus is \"Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics\" by J.E. House.  Both are excellent!"

                "Text": "I have quite a few books on Quantum Mechanics. This book does what the others do not. The first half is about simple math. Understanding that QP - PQ = ih/2pi is the matrix form of an equation and the QP - PQ is not zero because the matrices do not commute is critical. This is basic stuff that a lot of books just skip. The second half uses the math to explain some of the features of Quantum Mechanics. For me I needed the detailed first half even though the math was not too hard. Now I can read my other books with a new understanding and finally I am starting to understand Quantum Mechanics."

Dover used to dependably print their technical books on good quality paper, but this book had astonishingly bad paper, and the ink bleeds into it. At least, I won't feel bad marking it up... They seem to have used the paper they use on their one dollar classic novel reprints, or worse."

                "Text": "I liked this book and learned a good deal from it. It is intended as a look at only some aspects of QM -- a slice -- not the subject as a whole. It has some problems: he never defines quite why or how the given matrices are chosen for ecample.  It seems like a good \"add on\" to whatever other introduction to QM you are reading."
