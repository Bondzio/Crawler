                "Text": "Stan Gibilisco sort of dropped the ball with this one.  It is an adequate overview of classical physics.  But it tries to cover to much ground and in doing so, doesn't really cover any topic at even a rudimentary level.  About the most a general reader will get out this volume is an idea of \"how\" to look for a book to answer their curiosity."
