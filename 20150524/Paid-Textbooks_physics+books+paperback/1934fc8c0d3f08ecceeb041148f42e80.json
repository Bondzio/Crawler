                "Text": "A Brief History of Time has had a tremendous impact on scientific thought since its initial publication in 1988.  The Big Bang and Black Holes have become parts of our common vocabulary.  Why review this book now?  Perhaps some readers are not aware of a special Commemorative Edition of this book that was issued as an \"Updated Edition\" on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of its initial publication.  In the \"Acknowledgements\" at the beginning of the book, Hawking gives great credit to his editors and friends who have helped him improve the book \"considerably\" in revising the text.  In this Edition, Hawking states \"I have taken the opportunity to update the book and include new theoretical and observational results obtained since the book was first published. I have included a new chapter on wormholes and time travel.  I also describe the progress that has been made recently in finding dualities or correspondences between apparently different theories of physics.\" A discussion of the significance of cosmic microwave background and its fluctuations is included.  These are great reasons to reread this classic work, which has to be one of the finest in the history of science."

                "Text": "This is a wonderful book. It really explains many concepts of modern physics in layman's terms. Often we hear scientific words bantered about on various educational television programming without really understanding the concepts and theories behind them. This book goes into concise detail on quite a few topics and does a rather good job explaining them. I thought the explanation of Einstein's general theory of relativity was well done. The explanation of time differential when matter nears the speed of light was explained quite clearly. It truly is relative from your vantage point. Also the concept of space being curved was well presented. This is really a very interesting book. I truly couldn't put it down when I found it in the library. It really stimulates your thought processes and gives you new perspectives on the world we live in. I really like this book."

                "Text": "First, I must say that this book changed the way I think about the universe.  Unbenownst to me, I was still thinking in terms of turn-of-the-century physics.  Hawking brought me up to date, and made it interesting.  Some may disagree, but I think Hawking's writing style is superb (for those who complained: Come on, how high can your expectations for someone explaining theoretical physics be?  Were you expecting someone of C.S. Lewis' calibur or something?), and I often found his humor quite enjoyable.  I would HIGHLY reccomend this book to someone interested in knowing where the field of theoretical physics is at (or at least was at. This book is very slightly behind the times now.), and how the universe is being understood by some scientists.  I don't buy all of the views Hawkings advances, but they are very interesting to read about, and I think it is good to know where science is at right now.  My only complaint about this book is that he should have made it longer, and he especially should have spent some more time explaining String Theory."

                "Text": "Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds on Earth right now, and it's a rare treat to find such a mind that is also such an eloquent communicator.  This book brings fantastically complex physics down to an easily digestable (and very yummy) level with practical examples, analogies, and pictures.  I had to read it for my physics class, but had so much fun reading it that I asked my teacher to recommend a similar book that I could read for fun.  The book blends the historical development of the subject with the scientific reality as we know it today, and Hawking is not afraid to admit errors (even his own!) in past theories.  I respect a person who can admit their wrongs and turn it into a learning experience.  This is easily the best treatment of the subject I've found yet (quantum physics is something of a hobby for me... proud to be a geek!) and I recommend it to anyone who's curious about the nature of the Universe or the amazing things being discovered right now."

                "Text": "This book brings physics to the understanding of the average women and man.  It's basically a survey's course on Einstein's relativity and quantum physics with a little black hole and big bang here and there.  The real magic of this book is the author himself--reading from a man of his scientific stature, the enigmatic genus in the wheelchair feels more life-like rather than a caricature on a Simpson's episode.  I really dug the part how we can speculate that the universe is presently expanding and not contracting.  I liked how it made me muse on time and the life that we see today would differ if the universe was headed back to its origin.  The book does leave me with a sense of wanting to more, which was good because I went on to read Brian Greene's \"The Elegant Universe\" afterwards.  \"The Elegant Universe\" proved to be more elucidating in explaining Einstein's relativity and quantum physics, and goes into a bit of a breadth in black holes and big bangs (in the frame work of string theory).  It is true that the book is the successor to \"A Brief History of Time\", but I feel Brian Greene's book lacks the charm that Hawking has put into his (or the charm that we put into it).  At any rate, both very good books for the novice at mind."

                "Text": "I am the quintessential sophmore in high school. I even live up to the greek meaning: \"wise-fool\"; I am the kid who lacks the intelligence to be a \"nerd\" but wishes he had the capacity to be one. I eagerly pick up books that are far over my head, but this book was different. A Brief history of Time presents an intricate topic generally for the simplistic, non astro-rocket scientist type. Hawking didn't gorge his book with alien equations and twenty letter words. Hawking didn't intend this book to be read by Ph.D's in physics, intending instead to write it for laymen, sophmores, like me. The book isn't intended to enable the reader to write disquisitions on wormholes after reading it; however, it is a primer. It acquaints the reader with the subject It is written succiently and the only reason I am giving it four stars is because I am still skeptical that for some readers it may be superficial. But heck for us sophmores it is enough information to at least appear smart... So what do you think about the Space-Time Continuim?"

                "Text": "As Hawking confesses, this is one of those Physics books which will try to explain you everything without feeding you real meat or printing single equation (i.e., except E=MC2). So the result is that after reading this book you would start believing that somebody taught you Chinese but apparently you can't write a single letter in Chinese. I bought the book simply because I think Hawking is probably the closest in living people who can sit next to Einstein and Newton. The way it starts is really engaging. Illustrations and those full color images are absolutely fantastic. The way the book goes is to take you on the journey to just few microseconds after the big bang to few minutes after. The most interesting part of the book is the discussions and disputes about singularity. I guess that alone (or just that, depending on your view) is worth the price of the book. It's written with lots of passion, clever remarks and it will make you think. But soon enough you will realize you are a helpless being quickly descending in the muddy quicksand. As the chapter passes by, the topics get increasingly fuzzy and extremely confusing. I won't blame the author as the publisher didn't allow him to put \"real meat\" in his writings. These kind of advanced topics are inherently difficult to understand without presenting actual equations and dealing with guts and gore. I read the later parts of the book 3 times trying to make sense of it and finally came to a conclusion that it is impossible to extract a logical meaning of that part of text, even though it's syntactically correct. So buy this book to get some first hand insights in to singularity and dive in to black holes, but save your time by skipping later chapters."

                "Text": "In this book, Hawking definitely succeeds at making one understand the very complex side of physics. I chose it in the hope of understanding Einstein's theory of relativity and black holes, the latter of which he describes well and the former of which he names often but does not explain. I found that although everything he mentions is fascinating and totally mind-boggling (such as the make-up of what we thought were indivisible atoms, the difference between real and virtual particles and waves, and his discussions of space-time and singularities and the expansion of the universe), many times it is not well-written  and can take a while to decipher, although the diagrams and other illstrations are, for the most part, pretty helpful. One thing that I found particularly annoying was his constant assertion of credibility - \"... a position that Isaac Newton once held, and which is now my own ...\" - we all know how ingenius Hawking is, its part of why we chose to read the book, right?  As the heading to this review implies, the book is gripping in a few parts but, in most, it requires a large amount of determination and a \"want-to-know.\" If you're not interested in physics and astronomy and essential theory without proof (which can be quite frustrating), this book is not for you. But if you're looking for a better understanding of the when, where, how, why of the universe, I'd say give it a shot - you may enjoy it."

It is true that I had to read a few sections a few times until I got it, but that is not his fault but rather my ignorance.  I also like the way he slips through the theologically tricky parts of our present knowledge, where others have been truly dogmatic and unpleasantly partisan.  About the most comprehensive book on cosmology I have read.  Since 1996 I am sure that much has happened and many new discoveries made. I cannot help wondering what he would say about the implications of the discovery of Higgs Boson. It is a fascinating read and particularly useful for getting a broad grasp of the subject.  I now look forward to getting myself more up to date."

                "Text": "This book is the updated version of the international bestseller, so any praise on my part will surely be redundant. As such, I will just summarize what you get with this book: a fascinating intro to major physics theories (including Newton's, Einstein's general relativity, and quantum theories), and a brief overview of cosmological mysteries (including big bang and black holes). As anyone even vaguely familiar with Hawking knows, he's got a knack at making even the most abstract ideas sound remarkably simple and interesting. This book is accessible to anyone, regardless of your academic background (you will understand most of it even if you've never taken a single physics course). If you ever wondered about the physical world around you or the universe at large, you will not find a better introduction anywhere; if however, you're already well read in the subject, head straight to the more in-depth look at essentially the same concepts and more found in Greene's 'Elegant Universe.'"

                "Text": "This is one of the early books written for those who prefer words to equations to understand cosmology of blackholes. The author attempts to answer basic questions such as; was there a beginning of time? Is there an end to the universe? What are similarities of blackholes, singularity, and Big Crunch? Is the universe infinite? Or does it have boundaries? What are the effects of the critical value of the universe's density on its rate of expansion? What is the role of God in the creation of the universe and how it can be evaluated by the anthropic principle? Did God creat laws of quantum mechanics and theory of relativity and let it evolve itself without leaving an option for him to intervene? How did he choose an initial state or configuration of the universe? What were the boundary conditions at the beginning of time? The author reviews the literature that includes Newton's laws of gravitational force, Einstein's theory of relativity, and quantum mechanics. Problems arise when one combines these theories to understand the four natural forces; the electromagnetic force; the strong and weak nuclear forces; and the gravitational force by one unified field theory (Quantum theory of gravity, and Superstring Theory). This theory must unify the forces of the cosmos and forces of microcosm so that it can explain the grand plan of God in the creation of heaven and earth. The author describes quite a few interesting anecdotes in academic research: The first experimental evidence in support of Einstein's theory of relativity contained errors that were as great as the effect they were trying to measure. In 1920s it was supposed that there were only three men who understood theory of relativity and now thousands of graduate students and many millions are familiar with this theory: Many readers should be encouraged at this. When the author presented his theory that black hole radiates like a hot body, many repudiated his assertion and later accepted it. Max Born, a Nobel Laureate in 1928 told a group that physics research will end in six months, when Dirac published equations for an electron, in the anticipation that the whole of physics problems are solved. This should remind all of us how far the science and mankind has progressed despite this prediction. Newton, one of the greatest scientists of this planet also had a streak of meanness in him. Einstein's honesty as a scientist could be found when he admitted that his universal constant to account for a static universe is a mistake, but he was also less willing to accept quantum mechanics; this is known by his well known comment that \"God does not play dice.\" Hawking having a bet with Kip Thorne over the existence of black holes in Cygnus X-1 for Penthouse magazine to Private Eye magazine shows the fun side of academic rivalry. This is one of the very few books I have read that discusses God's role at the level of quantum mechanics. The reader should feel lucky to have such a book for his/her personal library."

I can easily say that, out of those and any conceptual physics book that I have read even a portion of, this is the easiest to read and offers the most knowledge. While I have read reviews, not only on Amazon but in numerous other sources, that say that this book is complicated, foolish, or even proves that a creator exists, it is/does none of these things. I, only from taking a single semester of High School level conceptual physics, was able to easily understand the novel. Also, regarding the foolishness, many who do not realize basic physics principles (such as inabsolute and imaginary time) might feel that this is somewhat silly and abstract. Finally, regarding creationism, Hawking only states that physics does not disprove religion. For instance, he states that while the big bang created time, it is still possible that a \"God\" created the universe at that time, and therefore does not take any stance on religion whatsoever."

In other cases the explanations are poorly written.  The truth is Hawking is not a good writer.  He is incapable of clearly explaining complex ideas.  Like many other pop-science writers he uses poor analogies to avoid explaining abstract ideas.  The problem is these analogies do not accurately convey what is really happening.

If you are even remotely interested in physics this is a must buy! You don't need to know calculus or any of that stuff to read this book. It is simple to read. This book will change the way you look at the universe. Stephen Hawking should get some kind of award for this great book! Don't be decieved by the topic; I read this book as a 7th grader! Buy this book and you won't regret it! It will tell you about simple atomic structure just incase you don't allready know it, and as you progress it gets more complex, but no infrequently used word are undefined. There is even a glossary at the end of the book! If you are not a 4th grader this book won't be to difficult."

This time I read it just for fun and without the pressures of  class deadlines.  The book is by now a classic and I think one learns a bit  more each time one reads it.  By the way, if you like this kind of book,  which takes fascinating science and puts it into an exciting read in  layman's terms, try Nabokov's Blues and The Pleasure of Finding Things Out.  Both are of the same ilk.  When I first read Brief History of Time I found  it a refreshing choice for a class supplemental text. I don't think one can  read this book without gaining a broader view of ones world and what  \"makes it tick\".  It great that so many major scientists take the  time to translate the fascinating turf of their trades into the layman's  language which we can all find exciting.  Looking around, there is some  great science reading out there right now.  But, this one's a classic.  If  you haven't read it, or read it only for a class, like I did, read it  again."

The hardest chapter for me to get through was the one on particle physics, but it was downhill from there.

He was also the first man who published a book on theoretical physics that has  become popular world-wide (about 9 million copies have been sold). Many  readers have learned a lot of exciting things about our universe from this  book. So did I - even though I was a student of theoretical physics.  Although this book is not as perfect as Brian Greene's \"The Elegant  Universe\", the successor of the Hawking's book in the position of the  book on theoretical physics causing such a stir, \"A Brief History of  Time\" will remain a tour de force, a pioneering work which began a new  interest in physics among masses of people. That is why do I recommend you  to read this book about the big bang, black holes, the quest for the  ultimate theory and many other issues."

                "Text": "Glamour of Hawking's bestselling presentation of cosmology  and astrophysics (superstrings and elements of \"older\" quantum  physics added) rests, in my opinion, on two pillars: mystique of  the author's personality (or his mind-over-matter fate and stature) and  very readable and accessible exposition of his subject. Nicely illustrated and comprehensive (one gets the entire story, from the dawn of mechanics via general relativity to the superstrings and black holes thermodynamics), Hawking's \"History\" has  one excellent quality: an interested reader can, with a minimum of energy, easily swallow (in a gulp, so to speak) all the \"buzz\" concepts of contemporary cosmology. In short: if you read this book, you'll know (on a graphical/imaginal level) how the modern cosmological narrative looks like.  On the other hand: this story is anything but \"deep\". Its philosophical pretensions (the nature of Time, the Mind of God (what's that ?),  (in)determinism and free will, great \"whys\") are simply ludicrous. Some of his \"innovations\" (especially imaginary time, which has been virtually smashed as a concept in, for instance, William Craig's article in Brit. J. Phil. Sci., issue 41. p. 473-491, (1990)) are not happy at all. Even more- Hawking equates time as a physical concept with Augustianian-like philosophical Time about which neither he nor Einstein have anything to say (Einstein was at least lucid enough  not to stray beyond  physics self-imposed limits). \"Mind of God\" is another, completely redundant & meaningless phrase when used in this context. Tampering with metaphysics  has long since been a fatal/\"tragic\" flaw of ill-equipped scientists. Hawking is just another prey in this, as it seems, irresistible intellectual trap.  In sum: I would recommend this book as a nice intro in cosmology and some physics history, amply illustrated and accessible to  all interested in expanding their sci conceptual framework (although, Greene's \"Ellegant Universe\" is a better book for laymen). For anything \"deeper\"- forget it."

Anyone interested in getting an idea on the present debates dealing with existence of the universe should read this book.  But keep in mind that an understanding, or interest, in physics and mathematics are necessary to fully understand the book; and even with a good background you will find yourself re-reading certain pages over and over again.  One criticism is that Hawking teases the reader on his ideological conclusions regarding his research.  At times the reader thinks he is a proponent of a universe created by God and at others, the reader begins to doubt the author's suggestion of that.  Nevertheless, it is an objective book that anyone interested in physics or the \"ideological conclusions\" of present-day physics, can really benefit from."

It gives a good overview of the history of physics and the universe and leaves the reader both satisfied and yearning to learn more. Despite being at the forefront of his field Hawkings manages to come off as unpretentious and understandable. Overall an excellent read for fans of science and those looking to learn more about our incredible universe."

He does a great job of merging the concepts of astrophysics with those of quantum mechanics in this book. Maybe I should have purchased a hardback edition rather than a kindle edition."

It was a real struggle to finish some of the chapters toward the middle because I felt like I was understanding so little, but I'm glad I stuck with it because I really enjoyed the end. I'm sure some of my difficulty could be attributed to a variety of factors such as the complexity of the topics Hawking is attempting to cover and my own ignorance in the realm of physics. All the same, I would recommend this book to any layman interested in important topics of interest in modern physics. Hawking builds his discussion of the cosmological realm of physics historically, and I found his historical buildup to be the most interesting part of the book. When he really delves into the modern theories behind black holes, inflation, particle spin, and so on, I got a little lost. He wraps up nicely with a discussion of the future of physics and the search for a Grand Unified Theory. I made this book my introduction into this realm of science, and I hope to return to it someday having acquired a much greater understanding through further reading. I just get the feeling there is a lot to be appreciated here but I am limited by my own understanding."

He takes us to the beginning of time-just after the big bang- and expertly leads us through singularities, string theory to an expanding (and infinite?) universe.  That and more! His ability to explain complex theory is dazzling. I was a student of physics up to university entrance level, but reading this book was not a journey down memory lane, it gave me another wonderful perspective to a lot of the physics concepts therein.  Professor Hawking neatly documents the evolution of time from a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. He very neatly demystifies the idea that time continues backward forever. he demonstrates that time is a property of the universe that it did not exist before the universe came into existence.  Finally, it was a wonderful relief to learn that the Big Bang theory is not inconsistent with the existence of God. I also found string theory very cogent, and I did not get enough of it!.  Thank you, Prof. Hawking!"

I myself have a basic understanding of the foundation of the sciences, but am by no stretch of the imagination an expert in any field, and I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Questsions of such heavy implications that they are downright dizzying, i.e., Does the Universe have a beginning? If so, what happened before that? Does it have an end? How do we know?, etc., are explained in an enlightening but generally non-technical way. I think this book can be useful for those already enlightened in such matters, an those who are not. Most of the book I found to be very readable and I feel that I have learned something from it. There were a few parts, indeed, that I can't claim to have understood fully, but many things (such as the theory of relativity, which I have looked up in many sources before) I now have a grasp on because of this book. I think just about anyone can learn from this book. It takes not only a great physicist, but a great WRITER to pull that off."

I found Dr. Hawking's writing style to be extremely accessible despite the heavily scientific nature of the material.  Though some of the mathematical explanations were beyond my grasp (especially in the latter chapters), the general implications of his theories were clearly outlined and explained in the most down-to-earth manner possible.  I often suffer from the affliction of losing interest in a book halfway through, but I found that in this case my attention span was not an issue.  Hawking's presentation of the subject matter was such that I was never discouraged or bored by his explanations. His diagrams and pictures were tremendously helpful in this area.  I highly recommend this book to those with even a passing interest in the nature of our universe, as Hawking's findings in this field certainly lie at the very forefront of all human knowledge.  I cannot speak from the perspective of the serious student of physics, but I think that there is clearly much is this work that will interest him as well."

Time, space, string theory, multiple dimensions are all brought to life in an easy to read (if not fully understand) way.  Augmented with plenty of illustrations and no equations, this approach to science is available to anyone - and Hawking's masterful writing style is a true gift.  A must read."

The book contains a wealth of basic information to help you understand science's view of just how our universe might have been put together. For a layman such as myself, it is a bit of a stretch to wrap your mind around the concept that that Hawkins presents here. However, the clarity of the presentation makes comprehension of the complex concepts presented much easier then it might have been. There are a number of more recent books by Hawkins and others on the subject. But I am glad that I read this book as a primer to reading those. If you have not read this book, I highly remirecommend that you do. There are many good reasons why this is one of the most popular books on science ever written."

This book has helped me wrap my mind around many of the complex issues involved in modern theoretical physics.  Stephen Hawking provides a clearly written explanation of many of the important ideas, and traces their evolution.  He avoids the math, and focuses on the concepts, which makes it possible to get at least a basic understanding of what the frontiers of this science look like.  I did have to put the book down a couple of times while I tried to wrap my mind around the concepts described, but Hawking's descriptions were easy enough to understand that I was generally successful in grasping the concepts.  An excellent book for the layperson who wants a basic understanding of what theoretical physics says about the universe."

I am also in the midst of my second year of high school  Physics. I just finished A Brief History on my third attempt to read it.  The first time I only made it to chapter 2; the second time, I made it to  about 6, but this time I finally made it through all 11.  Hawking is  one of the greatest physicists and cosmologists of the late 20th century,  and that much is evident in reading his book. Hawking discusses topics of  black holes, time travel, the history of the universe, and the large-scale  structure of the cosmos. Although Hawking gives a very thourough and  informative picture of modern day cosmology and physics, he often gives a  slightly TOO complete picture. He also tends to jump right into many of the  topics with little or no introduction, leaving the reader lost behind.  Hawking's book is a great explanation of the cosmos as we see it today.  However, this book is by no means for the faint of heart. Also, I would not  recommend this book to anyone without a signifigant knowledge of general  physics and cosmology. However, if you're ready for a thick read, jump  right in!"

I picked up Brief History of Time when it came out and simply couldn't digest it. More reading, more study, more thinking and Voila! I picked up Hawking's book again and read it with understanding! With this book, Dr. Hawking has helped me pull all of that study together into a cohesive conceptual body (no small task!). If you have pursued this subject in a similar manner then you will be delighted with this treatment of Relativity and beyond. Now, it is on to String Theory, Dark Energy, Dark Matter and more Hawking books to help explain them."

I recommend that the reader consult parallel texts of slightly  greater mathematical and physical difficulty to better understand what is  going on, if necessary with the help of consultants or tutors.  I have  already remarked in other reviews for Amazon.com on the difficulty of  understanding entropy, for example, which comes in many types not all of  which are similar, and its relationship to probability, chaos, and so on is  not quite settled at this time.  The interested reader could consult  Ruelle's book (I forget its date at the moment) for a readable and inspired  account of entropy by one of its pioneers.  There has also been some recent  work indicating that more information can come out of a black hole than  Hawking thought.  I recommend that readers also read Roger Penrose's two  books of the last 20 years, which are also popularized science which  compare idealism and materialsm (the latter as represented by computer  Ingenious Followers, in my terminology).  Penrose and Hawking discovered  many of their discoveries together."

It is a great way to simply expand your knowledge by understanding the big bang, quantum mechanics, and even sub-atomic particles.  Stephen Hawking is an excellent writer, not to mention the Albert Einstein of our time; he makes this book almost seem like a novel more than a non-fiction book.

There is only one take on the book, which is its loss of consistency of level of argument. Which means it can move from sheer simplicity to technical complexity and back."

                "Text": "The Metaparaphysics Philosophic Theory (TMPT) Discovery, Is The Unifying Sole Theory , with its Knowledgeable Concept(s) - ever existed in Human History - towards helping man and humanity to Consciencely Comprehend The Universal Factual Realities: May 21, 2014 at 8:29am The well known scientist Stephen Hawking - In His Book Brief History of Time - seems has been going on and on to describe how there are four fundamental forces in nature ; as what we call gravity, the well-known electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force that binds orbits of electrons KLMNOPQ to the nucleus in every atom, and the strong nuclear force(s) that hold(s) the sub-atomic particles ( neutrons, positrons , neutrinos , Positrinos ..etc.) within the nucleus of an atom altogether. The Relativity theory with its equations - proposed by Albert Einstein may explain only the first three. but So far, theoretical physicists have not been able to come up with a needed profound theory that unifies the strong nuclear force with the other three. As Hawking points out, the effort to do so has been the focus of theoretical physics within the last fifty years. In Hawking\u2019s concluding remarks, he offered his own insight(s) into what the future may be like once a \u2018Unified Theory of the Universe\u2019 is finally discovered. The intertwined histories of scientific discovery and of religion are the story of our human trial(s) to comprehend or to simply understand our universe consciously; both Logically and Ontologically - in relation - to our knowledgeable factual reality: using our Human Conscienceness , Sub-Conscienceness and Un-Conscienceness as an existing reality and knowledge at the same time. Surecracy - with Its (TMPT) Theory - has presented such a unifying and profound knowledgeable approach; with its dynamic , interactive and even integrated insight within Human Conscienceness involving both Human Intellect (logic) and Psycho-moral (Ontological) in order to accommodate such an existing knowledge which represents the paradigm of the universal factual realities. Here such a fundamental conceptual subject matter might simply be comprehended - in Surecracy and its Theory - by the presence four fields of knowledge and/or dimensions including: Science , Philosophy, Religion and the belief in the sole creator being called and/or described as GOD / Allah. where Physical , Meta-physical and the Para-physical fields of knowledge are actually co-existing, overlapping with its circles and are interacting as well as reacting altogether through three scientific defined mechanisms: The Spontaneous Chain Reaction Mechanism(s) , The Negative Loop Feedback Mechanism(s) and The Competition Mechanism(s) ; all within both Material(s) and Energy of such a dynamically interactive existence(s) with its various energy levels as well as outside its relative boundaries including our Moralo-psycho- intellectual existence(s), knowledge and co-existence(s) in such an identified factual reality. Surecracy also has also identified within its Meta-paraphysics Philosophic Theory ( TMPT) a specific role/rule of philosophy as knowledge that must act integro-dynamically - as a function of time - in between science and religion; a matter which seem more than crucial and/or important in both history of Science and Universal Descending Monotheistic Religion(s). In Conclusion: There is no doubt that such a Surecratic Approach and/or Knowledge which is/are presented here in Our ( TMPT) Theory , seems extremely useful, Even Practical , balanced and unifying the human understanding - in depth - to the coexisting universal factual realities; in and out of our materialistic - energetic bio-bodies as well as within our Moralo-psycho-intellectual conscienceness with its profound Psycho-moral (Soul) as both are being considered - in surecracy - interconnected , harmonized and integrally Interacting , acting and Reacting as cumulative knowledge and as an existence at the same time ..! Untill Today both Theorists and Experimental Physicists seem still to have two conceptual / fundamental scientific problems not only regarding what Hawking has described above as a difficulty regarding a quadri-dimensional unifying an accommodating theory, explanatory to strong nuclear force(s) that hold(s) the sub-atomic particles within the nucleus of an atom altogether but also to provide us as well with a seriously needed explanation in light(s) of the relativity and the quantum physics Theories: How ENERGY (Before The Big Bang in both physics and astronomy ) - as the basis of all material(s) - CAN BE CREATED and/or BE BROUGHT and/or ORIGINATES FROM NOTHIG / NULL ..?! ...

                "Text": "Glamour of Hawking's bestselling presentation of cosmology  and astrophysics (superstrings and elements of \"older\" quantum  physics added) rests, in my opinion, on two pillars: mystique of  the author's personality (or his mind-over-matter fate and stature) and  very readable and accessible exposition of his subject. Nicely illustrated and comprehensive (one gets the entire story, from the dawn of mechanics via general relativity to the superstrings and black holes thermodynamics), Hawking's \"History\" has  one excellent quality: an interested reader can, with a minimum of energy, easily swallow (in a gulp, so to speak) all the \"buzz\" concepts of contemporary cosmology. In short: if you read this book, you'll know (on a graphical/imaginal level) how the modern cosmological narrative looks like.  On the other hand: this story is anything but \"deep\". Its philosophical pretensions (the nature of Time, the Mind of God (what's that ?),  (in)determinism and free will, great \"whys\") are simply ludicrous. Some of his \"innovations\" (especially imaginary time, which has been virtually smashed as a concept in, for instance, William Craig's article in Brit. J. Phil. Sci., issue 41. p. 473-491, (1990)) are not happy at all. Even more- Hawking equates time as a physical concept with Augustianian-like philosophical Time about which neither he nor Einstein have nothing to say (Einstein was at least lucid enough  not to stray beyond  physics self-imposed limits). \"Mind of God\" is another, completely redundant & meaningless phrase when used in this context. Tampering with metaphysics  has long since been a fatal/\"tragic\" flaw of ill-equipped scientists. Hawking is just another prey in this, as it seems, irresistible intellectual trap.  In sum: I would recommend this book as a nice intro in cosmology and some physics history, amply illustrated and accessible to  all interested in expanding their sci conceptual framework (although, Greene's \"Ellegant Universe\" is a better book for laymen). For anything \"deeper\"- forget it."

                "Text": "There are several things to enjoy about Hawking's work aside for the science. Like a good teacher he uses everyday objects to help us understand really complex principals, he shares his passion for his subject with his audience (with dozens of exclamations points), and has that wry sense of humor so particular to the British. However, there were two aspects of this work that won my favor: his historical approach to the \"evolution\" of science (moving for geocentrism to heliocentrism, for instance)showing that it is not exact or perfect but constantly being challenged by new information--but moreso the personal window he opens into his personal life and some asides about living with ALS (Lou Gehrigs disease) and how that has contributed to his work, giving him lots of time in which to think. As for the science, the book is described as being written for the lay person, but I'd qualify that as not for the novice. You should come to this book with some understanding and appreciation of the universe to benefit from his teachings, but then again, why else would you be reading a book about a unified theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics to explain black holes and the origins (and possible demise) of the universe? For the mathphobic, skip to the more theoretical chapter \"The Origin and Fate of the Universe\", especially if you are someone who believes that a divine creator set the whole universe into motion."

But maybe one should expect a clearer understanding to stem from a book which was written for, and is specifically addressed, to the general public. So, in spite of the fact that this book has achieved the status of a best seller, and it is well written, I give it 3 stars because it does not really achieve its primary goal. Without assuming that we are all ignorant, but also discarding the contrary, one can doubt if more than 30% of those who bought it (except people that do not recognize the concept of humbleness) truly understands the subject matter. On the other hand, this is an interesting book for people versed in physics, engineering, mathematics and the like, but not for real operators in physics. So, if you are after a book from Hawking that can really help you to better understand universe, time and other complex issues, go after THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. It is more like reading Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy."

                "Text": "I purchased this book because I have always respected Stephen Hawking. As a student of Engineering I already have some background in what he discuss throughout the book. However I will say that Mr. Hawking does indeed posses a natural talent of explanation. I'm certainty no physicist and yet his writing makes even the most complex theories seem so simple. I was also pleasantly surprised with his writing style. I know most scientist have a bland way of writing things or they just simply don't know how to write, this is certainly not the case with Hawking. Every now and then you get a glimpse into the humor of Hawking. Whether it be his making bets over his scientific discoveries or even his good humor about his illness, one line in particular \"I started to think about black holes as I was getting into bed. My disability makes this a rather slow process, so I had plenty of time\" (Hawking, 103). This line shows the reader that Hawking has not lost his sense of humor despite how his disease has crippled him. A great deal of respect must be given to Hawking for his life, accomplishes, and struggles. I highly recommend this book"

It did not use to challenging of words and even when I did not know what a word meant, it was in the glossary! I learned so many new things about stars, black holes, and what might happen to earth in the future. This book really got me interested in science and space. It really got me thinking on topics I had never thought about before. I would recommend this book to anyone! It will definitely make them look at the sky differently! Now when I see stars I think about how far they are away and I wonder what they really look like because we cannot tell because we are so far away! The only reason I would not recommend this book to someone is because they are not ready to understand what is going on or some of the words being used! Other then that I think this book is great! I think they should even read it in schools to teach students about space! It is amazing how much Stephen Hawking knows about space! Overall this book was great and everyone should go and read it!"

Reading the original A Brief History of Time left me with a few questions, and this illustrated version answered nearly all of them.  It is very easy to read and understand (thanks to Hawking's lighter tone of writing).  As he states in the preface, simply reviewing the illustrations and captions you can get the main idea of the Future Light Cone, the Singularity theorem, general relativity, abolition of absolute time, travelling through space-time with the aid of wormholes, and much more.  Not only do you get a quick lesson on cosmology and space-time, but you also learn of the famous physicists throughout time.  This book may also serve as a great vocabulary builder.  It is my opinion that A Brief History of Time should be a required read in high school science classes."

The author uses illuminating analogies, while rapidly moving through complex topics in a level of detail that doesn't bog down.  His use of figures, graphs and illustrations of ideas is something that is unfortunately missing for a lot of modern, popular science writing.  The author discusses worm-holes, black-holes, the subjective experience of time in such a mind-bending fashion which explains why this book has seeped in to so much of pop culture from the Simpsons to Donnie Darko.  The ideas presented in this book inspire awe in the reader and they are so compelling that you will never look at the world around you in the same way again.  A good example of accessible, intelligent popular science writing from a brilliant man and a great science popularizer."

The first two chapters are fascinating and a must read for anyone interested in the who's who of physics and cosmology. By the author's own admission the book attempts to avoid the use of mathematics and equations in fear of losing a general audience. The truth however is there are times when a little more detailed background information would have helped illustrate the point. The book is not suitable for midnight reading as it requires some intense and critical thought regardless of its attempt to appeal to the non-PHD type. I recommend the book over the tapes in that the book allows easy access between pages and chapters. Re-reading here is a necessity, not an option. Trying to 'get it' while fighting traffic will leave you exhausted ... hardly the way to start work! Enjoy. WCC."

I could follow the topics and theories discussed and was amazed at the concepts.  While I had some vague understanding of some of the theories, this certainly shows how little I actually understood.  Hawkings is brilliant, just in dummying up these concepts and relaying them as something so simple, shows his immence mental prowess.  It's a real joy to learn these things that you've read about and basically just ignored because you thought they were so complex.  Granted that he has simplified things but still the basis is there.  Here is a rare man who understands science and people, and can incite us to learn. Just fascinating, makes me want to read more about science, not just the fiction stuff either."

This book is without a doubt proof, as he gracefully is able to bring such massively  complex topics into understandable terms for virtually anyone willing to  play with the ideas to understand. I expected a voyage through difficult  material, but i was pleasantly suprised by the good style of the writing  and the appropriate interjections of opinion that accompanied it. Gradually  as we move through time with the book the material gets more complicated,  but try and understand these concepts anywhere else unless you have a firm  foundation in physics. This is a literary monument, and a throughly  enjoyable and satisfying trip through modern physics. Refreshing in its  approach, enlighting with its delivery of the content."

The book is very well written, with a sense of humor and trying to explain the nearly inexplicable to the layman; I could follow large chunks of the text, but sometimes it is just too difficult to comprehend. This made me think: is Stephen Hawking's disadvantage (being locked up in his own body) also his disadvantage?

Hawking does a great job explaining older theories and also telling why they were wrong or proven incorrect.

This remastered and re-engineered classic benefits enormously from Talvin Singh's deft touch in the studio and Professor Roger Penrose's innovative remixing of several of Stephen Hawking's central equations. Old favourites such as \"Big Bang to Big Crunch - Singularity to Singularity\" are still here, but revised thinking on non-baryonic particles is reflected, in the case of the above track, with a fresh UK Garage rub surely not foreseen by the astrophysicist when he first started experimenting with Newtonian general relativity and quantum mechanics back in the day. Hawking's freestyling with Roots Manuva on provides a competent (if inevitable) concession to hip-hop - think \"Dusted\" jacked up with an almost ironic take on string theory. But the Cambridge Lucasian Professor of Mathematics is at his best when he lays down his trademark dub-saturated beats as in \"The Role of Weakly Interacting Cold Particles\" with Sons of Silence and Professor Alexander Valenkin and the Tufts University Particle Fizzix Boyz taking the 'nuff respects on the sleeve notes."

It is much appreciated that he took what must have been a significant portion of his time to prepare this engaging work for the public and even for students of physics like myself, who have not been able to delve into the difficult and complex mathematics required at the forefront of physics these days. Of course, parts of Stephen's exposition were difficult to follow, but so are the amazing concepts leaders in this field find themselves having to propose and work on and try out with their advanced math skills in order to make advances.  I very much appreciate this tiny peak into their world and Prof. Hawking's clear exposition of the essential conclusions experts like himself have been able to make. I only hope that we'll see him write a second edition, catching us all up on the new experimental work and theoretical advances in the field, especially the amazing work being done and discoveries being found from the microwave cosmic background radiation."

I take my hat off to him if he only needed 2 times to understand what the author was saying. Since I enjoyed C.K.'s book so much, I will try to slug through it a couple of more times. If you want to know how much we don't know about the origin of the universe, this book is for you although it lacks not in theory. If you are mathematically challenged this book is not for you. If watching the old TV series \"Numbers\" made your head spin, you can figure this guy wrote all the technical dialogue. I am a avid reader. i gave this 3 stars because once in a while you should read something that stretches your mind. It also gave me some insight to the mind of Mr. Krauthammer whose recommendation caused me to read this book. I think it may take a few more than 2 readings for me though. This book is definitely not a page turner but it does fit in with a project I am presently researching. If you are just a casual reader who doesn't enjoy having your limits stretched, this is not for you. But if you enjoy the challenges of calculus and other advanced math theories give it a shot."

I had to smile when toward the books end, the question was finally raised, ever so briefly, as to whether any unified theory would accomplish much or serve well.  Finally, I must have completely missed the justification for trying to apply Q. M., a theory predicated upon small particles, when there is no way to speculate about what the big bang was before the bang."

Also \"A Universe from Nothing\" is more up-to-date in relation to some of the theories covered off in both books, so I did find myself ignoring some of Hawking's comments due to the fact that more recent research has provided more of an insight into what, when and how the big bang may have happened."

I have once seen a demonstration of  mathematics used in quantum physics and it literally frightened me. Because  I know that it is hard to reveal knowledge in a simple way to listeners  which are very inferior to you in certain field, I think Hawking's work is  incredible. It reads very logically, clearly and though it talks about  science, that is unreachably complicated for usual mortals, we can sense  the directions and thinking of men, who work in this and try to unveil the  mysteries of universe.

As a bored fifteen year old I was rummaging through my dad's books and came across an interesting looking (non-fiction!) book among hundreds of dusty  old books. Intersted, I read the introduction to get a feel for the book  before I continued on my search for some interesting reading material.  Within the first pages of the book I was hooked. Over the next week and a  half I gave up precious hours of sleep without a moment's hesitation. Never  had such complicated scientific theory come so easily (not that I have done  any extensive research...I am only a lowly freshman in highschool taking  biology, my only introduction to Hawking's topics come from middle school  science and any mention my dad has made to such subjects!) Only allowing  myself to read one chapter before I went to sleep I finished the book all  too soon. I recomend this book to any and everyone. Thought the topics are  daunting Hawking does an amazing job making them comprehendable for even  me!"

(The dilemma once came through my mind: if no, then how would the universe \"end in space\"? IF yes, then what's outside the boundary?) The most famous scientist tries to answer our questions.  Now that you've grown up, if your interest and curiousity are still there (hopefully), then this book is a \"must-have\". The author tries his best to use the most plain English without any equations (except E=mc2) to explain to the layman how the universe begin. However, I do like to warn you: this is not a kid's book. The idea is too advanced even for a high school science student.  I wonder how many people who own this book have read the whole book, since it's too easy to be stuck at one point and cannot go ahead.  My advice is: RELAX, just go ahead if you don't understand. You are not supposed to understand evey thing in the book.  This is a book that \"you only need to know there is such an idea/theroy, but don't try to dig deep into asking \"why\"\", for it's next to impossible."

It isn't every day that you get to read a book whose author helped to shape his field in a fundamental way. Even though he is considered the most brilliant theoretical physicist since Einstein, Hawking has managed to produce an accessible and enjoyable book that can be understood by laymen as well as scientists. We from getAbstract recommend this book not only for its masterly explanation of the workings of the universe, but also for its studied examination of what new discoveries mean for common man, philosophy and religion."

Prof. Hawking discusses general relativity, quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle, particles and forces, black holes and how they are not really black (two full chapters on black holes), the origin and fate of the universe and the nature of time. Scientists are hoping to combine general relativity with quantum mechanics to form one single unified theory - the quantum theory of gravity. This is extremely difficult and Prof. Hawking discusses some of the things the theory will need to have. The book takes us on a fascinating journey through the universe. It also gives us an insight into the mind of a great thinker. The best thing about this book is that its very clear and for people who don't like books with equations, you have gotten lucky - this book has just one equation - Einstein's famous energy=mass times the speed of light squared - which shouldn't be much of a problem. Once again, this is the best book you will find today on the topic."

The point is the search for a unified theory of physics that allows  Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, both very well established but seemingly  incompatible physics, to live together in peace and harmony.  My  recommendation: Read it, plow onward if it starts to snow you, and walk  away with a better understanding of the world (and some tidbits that will  prove to most of your friends that you're a LOT smarter than they are!)"

                "Text": "A Brief History in Time, written by brilliant physicist Stephen Hawking, explores the nature and fundamental principles of the universe.  Hawking talks about how the belief regarding the structure of the universe as changed from Aristotle's model which placed Earth at the center of the universe, to today's current model.  He discusses the big bang theory and it accuracy.  Hawking explains the principal of an expanding universe and discusses the three different theories regarding the expanding universe.  The book also delves into the nature of black holes and goes on to explain the properties of black holes.  Throughout his book Hawking talks about all the important discoveries made by scientist, including some of his own, that led to today's understanding of the universe.  I thought that this book was a good overview of the universe and the laws that govern it.  It explained the fundamentals of the universe thoroughly, and usually at a level that most people could understand.  However, at some points it got a little too deep into complex science that most people would not have prior knowledge in.  Hawking most likely wrote this book as a source of general knowledge for the public.  I recommend this story to anyone with an interest in physics and the universe because it is a great source of information about the universe."

Just one look at the cover of the book of him doing his signature paralyzed impression while floating through space is enough to split your side. It's a shame he wasn't able to audition for the Big Bang Theory due to his busy touring schedule because we all know he's the one who should be saying \"Bazinga!\" in his hilarious robotic voice. One of my favorite jokes and one that I believe is his most well told is found in this book, \"Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?\" LOL! What?! His unique and humorous approach to sharing his reflections on our wacky universe leaves the reader gasping for air. This makes for a great bathroom read along with Jeff Foxworthy's Redneck Dictionary and Sinbad's Guide to Life by another comedy god, Sinbad. Hoping to see Hawking perform his routine soon at Oxford or Cambridge but still waiting for the day he decides to sell out Madison Square Garden like legend, Dane Cook."

I had little understanding of the cosmos and astronomy until i read this book for a class. He is funny and fascinating on every page. It is amazing that the deteriorating body of Dr. Hawking is nothing to the brillance and ever growing nature of his mind. What lies behind his eyes (the real spark you can see of his thoughts) is truly a miracle that all should read and share. His explanations of how the earth came to be and keeps expanding is nothing less than the greatest scientific work of the 20th century. His work will last forever. Read this book to understand why you are here and what will happen after you."

                "Text": "The book is a bestseller; Many would have gone through; It gives a grand overview how human concept of universe changed from Galileo's times to the late 20 th centuary. As said in preface, he has avoided using mathematical  equations. There are a lot of figures to explain the concepts. It was  written with the view that it should reach a lay man. It was lucky that it  become a bestseller. Even though it does not demand mathematical maturity,  it demands from philosophical sensitivity. That explains why many who would  have brought it may not have gone through it. It needs atleast second  reading to feel the historical evolution and appreciate the modern  physicist's outlook on the important question about origin of our universe.  Carl Sagan's ending words in introduction captures the essence : a universe  with no edge in space, no beginning or end in time, and nothing for a  Creator to do'.

Hawking, however, is a man who has an amazing ability to teach mind-boggling subjects. His ideas about space-time, other dimensions, the big bang, black holes, wormholes and light are simply amazing!! His book is exceptionally interesting and will get anyone to think on a higher level. After reading this book, any reader will be able to amaze others with the knowledge contained within. Hawking is a man full of humor and his often self-depreciating jokes serve to spice up the reading and give the audience a break and an insight into the child-like mind of Hawking and other scientists alike. Illustrations in the book are very good at explaining the most intangible and unimaginable concepts about the nature of our universe. This book will make any ignorant person an inquisitive one. it is perhaps the best and most interesting book of the last two decades. Hawking is a sure hit!"

Hawking touches nearly every subject there is to be touched in classic and  modern physics, from black holes to time travel, and from wormholes to the  Great Unified Theory attempts, he manages to explain it all, and does so in  a language that is practically amusing and fun to read!

                "Text": "If it is even possible to write an engaging description of the origins of the universe, quantum mechanics and string theory, this text would fulfill that promise. In A Brief History of Time, renowned physicist Stephen Hawking lays out the current theories explaining our universe in simple, relatable and witty prose. The book spans the theories of Aristotle, Galileo and Einstein and culminates with the search for a grand unified theory that would answer the question of how and why we and our universe came to be. It includes fascinating discussions of the nature of time, the forces that govern our universe, and a layout of space-time and of our galaxy behind the simplified version most of us learn in school. Simple diagrams provide welcome aids, although Hawking's unpretentious descriptions and analogies often render them unnecessary. Some of the latter chapters are (perhaps unavoidably) a little dry, but on the whole, A Brief History of Time is a mind-bending and captivating book for anyone who never quite understood quantum physics but still has questions about existence beyond our planet."

                "Text": "From his proving that the big bang actually took place to his explanation of physics from Aristotle to the present, Stephen Hawking retains his title of smartest man alive in this text. His ease of relating the secrets of the universe to the common person is a gift which only a select few possess. From cover to cover, Hawking provides the reader with an indepth look at all the ideas that are collected in the spectrum of physics. He begins slowly with Newton's Laws and gradually builds to string theory and provides the reader with a fascinating look at black holes and ideas that seem to only exist in the sphere of science fiction novels. His humor and wit, combined with his down to earth examples, place this book above all other works of physics. I highly recommend this work to anyone who has any interest in learning more about the General and Special Theories of Relativity or simply wants to subside the common fear that rises when one mentions \"Quantum Theory\". Amazing!"

An intresting and somewhat disturbing subject. However, At the present time I  am studying Physics at 'A' level, which, although it helped me to  understand a lot of what was going on in the book it was nontheless a bit  confusing in places, especially, I found, in the last three chapters.  Although Steven Hawking has indeed cut out an incrediable ammount of the  jargon in this book it is still an advantage to know at least the basics of  Physics and of physics related subjects, if you don't you will find this  book a bit of a hard read. However, this is a very intresting book and I  definatly recomend it to anyone studying physics at any level (It has  certainly helped me in my studies) This book is generally good reading for  all but is a bit tough in places. Especially useful to anyone studying  physics."

There are many thoughts that Hawking shares with the reader that will inevitably stick with you.  Hawking's insights on time and space are intriguing, he sheds light on Einstein's theory of relativity, and compares that to a more unlikely view of an \"absolute time.\"  Hawking also talks a great deal about Black Holes, how we know they exist, and how the laws of physics are perhaps greatly altered inside of them.  The book is easy to understand, and you won't have to reread paragraphs to comprehend them, that is what makes this a good read for people who aren't astronomers or physicists."

Now, I tend to impress my friends and non-friends when  talking about issues such as Tim Travel, Super Strings and the nature of  the Universe (I proudly can say that I shut my Philosophy teacher's mouth  up)  Really, get this book, You'll like it. But if you are only up to only  learn new theories on the Universe, then get lost, friend, this book holds  everything, from particle physics to time Travel."

One day, one of your children may pick it up. It has a great detailed, but brief history of astronomy. I suggest the illustrated version of the book. It is much easier to follow with visual reference. We already lost Carl Sagan, one day we will lose this great scientist, Stephen Hawking. It is a book that is easy to read (for adults), and will be a good challenge for offspring. I highly recommend this book as a staple publication in your home."

It is easy to read and has pictures to explain what Stephen is talking about.  It is extremely thorough and you will definitely get a better understanding of time, space and the universe.  A third grader could understand it.  It takes all the hard to read scientific mumble jumble out and tells you straight forward in layman's terms.  I loved this book and refer to it often.  If you want to know more about your existence, get this book!"

Even the most skeptical reader will be hard-pressed to walk away from this book without a profound change in thought.  Like Carl Sagan's \"COSMOS\",  \"A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME...\" centers not only on scientific fact, but also on a unique imagination.  If you even have only the slightest interest in space, I strongly recommend picking this one up!"

My father and I both of somewhat higher than average intelligence, and some background in familiar sciences, his parents were both chemists.  Hawking does do an excellent job of providing the examples to allow you to understand what he is talking about, but still does not make you understand.  He had to work much harder than this to understand it himself and it is apparent.  Although I loved the book and recommend anyone read it, I warn that reader beware, you will feel small compared to the hugeness of both the universe, atom, and Hawkings intelligence."

It is not possible for many to understand everything in this book but what you will understand  makes this book worth reading. At least you should try. It holds the idea  that there is a unified theory that explains every incidents in this  universe. I myself believe this. As I am a Computer Science Student I see  the Unified theory in this way -\"The computer is only a combination of  zero and ones. But yet it covers every aspect of life, the simple logics  that are creating so complex ones, isn't it great! So if we take it as a  mirror of the universe (We can bulid worlds in computers) then the Universe  should have some basic things like the zeros and ones for Computer.\"  If you read this book you will also be able to create your own vision about  this universe. Thanks for reading."

Because the explanations are scarce, a lot of information is just thrown to you and you either accept it as true or not. In this point the book appears to be dogmatic, you just have to accept what it's being told because Stephen Hawking wrote it. I've read my share of scientific books, and this was by far the worst. I think it's because Stephen tried to explain a LOT of things in a format that doesn't work, as he says in a documentary about his life \"a best-selling airport book\". The book starts really interesting, and soon begin to be frustrating and it appears that you are reading an enigmatic alchemic book filled with nonsense and rubbish (since you can understand anything because they weren't explained). In my opinion it was not worth writing this book and it's not worth reading it. It can push you away of physics really, which is a shame. There are a lot of better books about the subjects written in \"A Brief History of Time\" in the market, I suggest that you look for them."

                "Text": "Stephen Hawking is a very well educated scientist.  The details he goes into about certain events in history is truly amazing.  He gives examples from his lifetime on many of these events.  Hawking is a very talented writer.  He does not use too many big words but in the few incidents that  he doeshe goes into great detail to tell you what they mean and also has a  glossary in the back of the book to allow you to look up words that you are  unsure about.  This book has sold over nine million copies and is still  selling.  Some of the topics he discusses are wormholes, time travel, fate  of the universe, forces of nature, and the expanding universe just to name  a few.  The one topic he discusses the most is the topic of black holes.  He devotes two chapters of the book to them.  The book has recieved great  reviews and i can definately see why.  If you are really into science and  want to learn a whole lot more than I highly recommend A Brief History Of  Time.  On a scale of 1-10 I would give it an 8.  ( The special 10th  anniversary edition contains a new foreword and updated chapters ).  Enjoy!"

The very process of doing such is inspirational imho, as is the model of the universe envisioned/presented.  Massive stepping-stones, on many levels, so to speak."

                "Text": "Hawking's book seeks to construct a self-enclosed cosmology which does away with God, placing responsibility for human knowledge of the transcendent with scientists, rather than its other claimants such as priests or capitalists. At the same time, Hawking uses the language of God and religion continuously, in order to reinforce the association of cosmology with transcendence and of himself as the ultimate sage of the transcendent world. Readers should understand that Hawking, like other cosmologists, does not present any universal truths about the universe, but simply renders a carefully fashioned mythology for Western culture, one which I believe should have no more worth than the other mythologies of this world. Anyone who doubts this may do well to consider that for many people, the only place they ever hear about God these days is when they read books on physics and cosmology... why is that?"

However, one can be sure that hearing these theories 'straight from the  horse's mouth (as Hawking is responsible for the development of many of  them) that one is being told the truth. He consciously presents his ideas  in a non-mathematical way to make the book accesible to anyone. Do not make  the mistake of thinking that this is a beginner's book only. I am a student  studying theoretical physics and i gained new insight into ideas I thought  i understood. A Brief History of Time displays excellently Hawking's  natural humour and his brilliant teaching skills. A Brief History of Time  is an essential classic."

                "Text": "Hawking's book \"A Brief History of Time\" can rightly be termed a publishing phenomenon. But why? It is not particularly well-written, contains some poor English and doesn't answer questions it poses early on. As a popular science book, it compares unfavourably with those of Paul Davies and, as far as the subject matter is concerned, \"The Primeval Universe\" by Jayant Narlikar covers the material much more lucidly. So what is special about this book? For some reason, which is not identifiable immediately, Hawking has become almost a cult figure. This is surprising since he works in a highly abstract area of physics which is not readily understandable to the layperson, except, possibly, as science fiction. It is also true that Hawking has been portrayed as the greatest British scientist since Newton. But is this true? Unlike the theories of Newton, those of Hawking have not been verified as yet. However, criticism of these theories is, on occasion, stifled. A case in point is provided by the Bekenstein-Hawking expression for the entropy of a black hole. A major objection to this is that it violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Papers raising this have appeared in the scientific literature and none has been challenged. However, articles have been rejected for publication purely on the grounds that the end result disagreed with Hawking. This is puzzling but it may lead some to feel that Hawking has achieved a status in popular culture which has influenced his scientific standing. If this is so, it is certainly not his fault but it is not a healthy position for science. In the end, though, the fact remains that this book is a real publishing phenomenon but not one which is justified by its contents."

Hawking starts off slowly, and then the next thing you know, you are totally engulfed in quantum physics, black holes that aren't really black, relativity, the uncertainty principle, the universe with and without boundaries and more!  Although this addresses some very technical and difficult subjects it's very readable.  This one will definitely leave you with some things to think about and wanting more.  It can take you from an immature uneducated concept of our universe and introduce you to our magnificently complex, immense universe.  I think it helps to put in perspective the fact that there's more to life and the universe than what we see every day.  As God put Job into his place, so too this will help us to relieve us of our anthropocentric pride and cause us to gaze in wonder into the heavens."

The creator to be an  external entity setting up the expected parameters then hitting the  create-button wich would make the universes evolvment according to the  parameters originally set. Stephens argument of a universe without  beginning excludes this creator due to Stephens own concept of the creator.  Tho' this book gives a good idea about how the universe proceeds according  to thought rules, but could have been more clear upon our own  interpretation with our surrounding world. Since we are the thinkers of  this world, God would be the concept among those thoughts, but there we  also tend to distinct ourself from that source... wich seems irrational."

My problem is that it doesn't lead anywhere, and the authors grandiose statements really contradict what his own data suggests.....others, avowed atheists like Carl Sagan have gotten ahold of this work and tried to twist it into proving that God does not exist, however; even the author reflects that these theories actually confirm the existence of a creator. It seems his brilliant mind cannot make the final leap that his theories suggest."
