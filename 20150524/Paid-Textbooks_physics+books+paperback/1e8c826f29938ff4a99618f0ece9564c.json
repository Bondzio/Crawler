                "Text": "This book tries to cover, (but not with success)  the needed mathematics for learning or teaching Quantum Mechanics. The contains of a course in Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics must include mainly two branches of Mathematics: Group theory and Operator theory.  The corresponded chapters in the book are short. This book, written in a high level, is difficult to be understood by undergraduate students. It is proper for postgraduates"

Perhaps, people are impressed because of the word \"Harvard\".  This is NOT a thorough treatment of QM mathematics.  It is at best a thumb nail sketch of the subject.  Schaum's outline of QM is much better and there isn't much difference in the price."
