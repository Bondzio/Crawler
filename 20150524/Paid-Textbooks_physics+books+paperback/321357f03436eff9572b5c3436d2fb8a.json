                "Text": "This book sees real life, everyday, human experiences thru a slightly scientific lens \u2014 no one has to be a rocket scientist to understand the laws of gravity, energy, momentum and how you can apply the physical basics to enhance the quality and understanding of our every day lives. The world sometimes feel like a confusing and chaotic place, but science is concrete -- it's comforting to know these things. On the flip side, non-science people maybe see the world thru art, words/language, or business/economics but those things are transient and bias, there\u2019s too many languages to keep track of, art is subjective, and who the hell can trust business and economics\u2026 science is science and its\u2019 a universal language. Christine McKinley does a superb job of breaking down the laws of physics to accomplish anything you want in this life. I recommend this book to all rockstars, runway models, astrophysicists, ninjas, and anyone else in between!"

Christine McKinley mixes physics with life in a way that is educational and enjoyable.  My non science majors loved it as much as my science students.  Christine also served as our guest lecturer for a community event and the place was packed.  I'm still getting compliments on her presentation and kudos for bringing the book and author to campus."

She gives very clear explanations of the laws of physics & uses examples that are easy for anyone to understand. She is an excellent writer. The book is fun to read and would be helpful for anyone who teaches physics in an academic or non traditional classroom."
