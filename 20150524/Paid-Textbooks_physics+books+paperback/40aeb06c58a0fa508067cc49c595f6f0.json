                "Text": "Book is falling apart after 3 labs because the binding is so poor.  The labs require much extrapolation, because the concepts that are asked on the preliminary questions are not covered thoroughly.  This lab manual doesn't go along with my physics class book at all which makes it difficult to do preliminary work.  My professor is very good, so he takes the parts he wants us to use in lab and explains them in detail."
