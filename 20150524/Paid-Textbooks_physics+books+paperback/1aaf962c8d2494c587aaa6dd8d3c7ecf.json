                "Text": "I took three semesters of physics to complete my undergraduate degree; I'll never forget the dumbfounded look on my instructor's face when we were studying electrical force and I asked, \"so, why *do* protons attract electrons, anyway?\"  The professor sputtered and said, \"it's just a force of the universe.  Shut up and stop asking stupid questions.\"  Or when the instructor presented Newton's third law (\"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\"), and I asked, \"So why is it that when I push against a wall it doesn't push back and fall apart?\"  The answer was, \"Well, the wall doesn't fall apart does it?  So that's that.  Shut up and stop asking stupid questions.\"  Dr. Feynman addresses *exactly* these types of questions, over and over again.  (If the earth and the moon are attracted to each other, why don't they crash into each other?  Why are snowflakes shaped the way they are?  Why does blowing on soup cool it down?)  I only wish this book had been 1300 pages rather than 130 - every page answered some nagging problem I've had with the physics explanation of the universe.  I don't think you can learn physics from this book, but you can get excited enough about it to start digging around and discovering more, like I did."

I have degrees in education and get great reviews from my students on a regular basis, but that didn't stop me from learning a lot from Feynman about how to expand a student's perception, application, and analysis skills and for this addition to my own personal bag of skills, I thank him."

                "Text": "As a top graduate student in engineering and science, physics is a part of my life. A number of courses I took have taught me plenty of analytical tools and essentials of physics. Having thought that I know almost everything about physics, I looked at Feyman's 6-easy pieces and couldn't help reading it to find out if there is something I can learn from a small and elementary physics novel. Well, I am so surprised that Feynman taught me quite a bit about things that I've never thought about before, even if I am well familiar the complicated and challenging quantum electrodynamics that he developed. He had such simple explanations on conceptually deep natural phenomena such as motion of planets and stars, probabilistic interpretation in quantum physics ; and amusingly interesting insights on daily events such as why blowing your soup to make it cooler. That's what I thought of Feynman's 6-easy pieces as a person who knows physics better than most people. In fact, I bought and will read Feynman's lecture on physics (3-volume) after reading 6-easy pieces. I am sure that I will learn much more from Feynman and so will anyone."

                "Text": "ONE PIECE AIN'T SO EASY:  Coefficients of friction and inclined planes give physicists the image of chemists without the charisma. In contrast, Nobel prize winner Richard Feynman, Ph.D., led part of the Manhattan Project in his mid-twenties, played the bongo well enough to have a compact disk issued, wrote several general interest and technical books, picked locks with ease, did informal stand-up comedy, served on the blue ribbon commission investigating the explosion of the shuttle Challenger, had three wives (two lost to deaths, the first hers, the third his) and a string of girlfriends in between. Students applauded at the end of his physics lectures, and frequently chuckled throughout.Richard Feynman was the Robin Williams of physics. What Williams can do through free association to make you laugh, Feynman could do to make you understand, and smile.In the scary Sputnik years, it had become apparent that fewer students were choosing physics just as the field was becoming more complicated,. And more of those students were dropping out in the early years, before they were exposed to the good stuff: particle physics, black holes and superconductors. Seeking a way to reverse this trend, Caltech approached their most brilliant physicist. At 43, Feynman designed then taught a two-year introductory course intended to minimize the tedious masses-and-pulleys work of freshman physics, and to maximize the exposure to the exciting frontiers of physics. He hoped to capture young imaginations while still malleable, before other interests distracted them.As Feynman agreed to do this only once, Caltech assigned a team of professors and grad students to record, transcribe and document the lectures for the benefit of the rest of the world. The only result for thirty years were three red books called The Feynman Lectures on Physics, since translated into ten languages. After his death in 1988, friends and colleagues, in awe of the man, have worked to make his work and thoughts available to the layman. (This also resulted in the book \"Why Do You Care What Other People Think?\", a sequel to his wonderful memoirs, \"Surely You\u00b9re Joking, Mr. Feynman.\")In \"Six Easy Pieces,\" the editors have compacted what are purported to be the easiest six of the Feynman Lectures into one book. In my college days, a good way to get sleepy fast was to read a physics text. \"Six Easy Pieces\" in print, though well thought out, is not much different. The man wasn\u00b9t Anna Quindlen. What makes the book worth the weighty price are the audio tapes that come with the package. The original lectures delivered in Feynman\u00b9s voice make the book easily digestible during a week of commuting. His inflections, joking, and laughter lead you through the drudgery and reveal some of the wonder Feynman saw in nature. The irritating exclamation marks throughout the book are merely an attempt to reflect how the physicist talked. It makes for okay reading, but wonderful listening.Some of the lectures border on poetry. Wrapping up the excellent chapter wherein he describes the relationship of physics to each of the other sciences, and holding a full wine goblet he had used to illustrate a previous point,  he concludes with a thought that describes his approach to life:\u00b3A poet once said, \u008cThe whole universe is in a glass of wine.\u00b9 We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe....How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts--physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on--remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!\u00b2Neither the tape nor the book so indicate, but I\u00b9m betting he downed the glass.An unfortunate flaw in this collection is the tape quality. They\u00b9ve done their best to digitally recover these thirty-year-old tapes, and tapes two through six are quite listenable. Tape one, however, is very grating and difficult to hear. While this first lecture is good, I\u00b9m surprised the publishers didn\u00b9t pick another or even use an actor to reproduce it.\"Six Easy Pieces\" is not for readers with no interest in the field. It\u00b9s best for techies of any age that can enjoy a fresh approach to what they should have learned when they were paying tuition.-- End --"

The book is very good at explaining physics concepts  and would make a good primer for someone who skipped high school physics.  The book also explains the relationship of physics to other sciences  (chemistry, biology, etc.) in a way that is simple and yet clear."

                "Text": "This book consists of what the editors consider to be six of the easier lessons from Richard Feynman's Lectures on Physics, a three volume work adapted from a series of freshman and sophomore level lectures given at Caltech in the 1960s. Each piece elegantly explains its intended topic without complicated or in depth mathematics. The reader will obtain the gist of the principles behind theses physical phenomena. Feynman whole heartedly admits to the limits of scientific knowledge of his time and in doing so very much dates his lectures. They nonetheless contain rich morsels of the knowledge of physics which will benefit the modern reader. This book is not intended to be an overview of physics. It assumes the reader has some basic education in some subjects, and a previous knowledge of elementary physics greatly helps to understand the pieces. More than anything, it is Feynman's style of teaching that is conveyed through the work's pages. The greatest joy in reading Six East Pieces is to experience Feynman's intuitive knowledge of physics and his subtly elegant conveyance of this topic."

If you are a physics or math enthusiast (and have a long commute, like me), you may want to seriously consider purchasing the entire set of lectures at once, rather than wasting money on \"Six Easy Pieces\", then \"Six Not So Easy Pieces,\" then buying the combined set that includes them all. (Yes, you can buy the entire 2-year course from Amazon Books.) Even on relatively \"simple\" topics, such as gravitation, it is amazing how Feynman can help open your eyes to the big picture that underlies the subject. The first lecture, \"Atoms in Motion,\" as well as the 2nd, \"Basic Physics,\" have deceptively s! imple titles. I am fairly sure you will not be bored by them. The last lecture, on quantum uncertainty, is by far the best. However, for this last lecture, you'll want to keep the diagrams handy for when you reach stoplights.  If you can keep from applauding with the audience at the end of each lecture, even while driving, you will have accomplished what I could not. Enjoy!"

Dispite holding a degree in Physics, I did not find the \"pieces\" all that easy, but very worth-while reading.  The lectures increased in difficulty, but all helped me understand the subjects better.  (I'm only bitter about not being aware of Feynman and his writings / lectures when I was an undergrad in college.)  I expect to re-read this little volume multiple times, because dispite it's claim to be \"easy\", the material is very rich, and mostly Feynman leads you from the known to the unknown.  I certainly recommend this book to all students of physics, from high school students to graduate students.  Other science and medical students will probably benefit from it also.  Interested layman may find it worth attempting."

His pacing, voice inflection, and tone really made dense ideas seem clear and easy to understand.  As a matter of fact, I must cut this review a bit short so I can get back to work on the new anti-gravity ray I'm developing thanks to the teachings of the good doctor"

If you haven't had a physics course yet, or don't plan on taking one, then this book will come in handy in helping to explain topics such as atoms, basic physics, how physics relates to other disciplines, conservation of energy, gravitation, and quantum behavior.

The genius of Feynman's writing is his uncommon ability to explain effectively concepts of physics often not explained as well by textbooks or other sources. For example, I found his explanation of uniform circular motion (that an orbiting object is \"falling around\" that which it orbits) extremely helpful. That Feynman was able to unlock some of the more arcane aspects of physics to those who had been attempting to understand them conceptually for years is further testimony to his brilliance. The book is therefore requisite for both those who are troubled by the study of physics and those enthused by it."

I enjoyed it thoroughly because I had some familiarity with the material covered and Prof Feynman is such an entertaining lecturer. That said, I think that if you are looking for a good introduction to physics concepts, you'd be better served by a more complete book"

The book is a collection of his lectures for introductory physics, may be a little too elementary for some.  Note that, nowadays such topics are delivered to students at earlier ages since Feynman first started these lectures. Still, how he uses daily language and examples to explain and highlight the basic principles of physics is impressive.  More importantly, he is very open and clear about exactly what is known and explainable and what we really do not know yet.  This comes in very handy in the last chapter on quantum physics, which I enjoyed the most."

To really understand any subject, it is helpful, I feel, to understand the way the people who have made important contributions to the subject think about the subject.  It is also important to know the pursuit of an understanding is within one's reach and is fun. Dr. Feynman does not dissapoint the reader in these respects.  It would have been fun to have been a colleague of his."

If you are interested enough in physics to be at this page, then reading this book is a no brainer. I will say that I read QED first, and that is Feynman's masterpiece. This work suffers by comparison only in that he is addressing underclassman and trying to get them interested in the big picture, whereas QED is the big picture. The great thing about this book is its conversational tone. You can almost imagine yourself in a classroom headed by the most brilliant physics teacher or our time. That's worth something, I'd say.

I would recommend reading Six Easy Pieces prior to QED if you want to read both.

But personally, I, too, like a  reviewer below, felt slightly bored while turing pages. I confess, for  practical insights, Epstein's Thinking Physics was much better."

His careful  construction of our modern physical world piece by piece was interesting  but not very informative.  I wasn't impressed and it seemed to me that this  book was simply published so someone could make money off of Feynman's  lectures.
