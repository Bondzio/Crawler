                "Text": "I am a kindergarten teacher whose school district recently adopted a science kit dealing with motion and force.  I was looking for some supplemental read alouds to serve as a way to introduce and reinforce the concepts we would be studying with this new science kit.  I was so happy when this popped up as a suggestion after I purchased another book.  It really helped and I have shared it with the other kindergarten teachers in my building."
