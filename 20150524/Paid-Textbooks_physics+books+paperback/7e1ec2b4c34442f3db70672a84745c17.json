It seems as though the author chose to show solutions for the easiest ones, leaving the most difficult problems out.  Each time I run into a problem I need help with, this book fails to provide the solution.  Most of the ones that I'm able to figure out on my own, such as most of the \"no-brainer\" ones, are the ones that this book covers.  Waste of money as I'm using google more often than I'm using this useless book."

The text only provides the answers to odd problems but doesn't help you solve them. This book isn't that much better. Don't get me wrong, it has solutions. However, it only has solutions to like, I dunno, every tenth problem and they are usually the problems you can figure out on your own anyway. My mistake for not looking into this book before I bought it. I hope I can get some money for it come buyback."

I wish I could sell it, but my conscience wouldn't allow me to take someone else's money for this book.  DO NOT BUY!"

I would definitely keep this book in your trunk.............so you can use it to start a fire if you ever find yourself stranded in  the middle of nowhere on a cold winter night. As another reviewer mentioned, there is a decent makeshift manual floating around on the internet with complete worked-out solutions for everything. That internet version is much better than this one, but even the helpful internet version contains a fair amount of typographical errors that will drive you insane. In short, there is no good solution manual for this textbook. Hopefully you have an approachable professor and/or helpful teaching assistants, because you'll need them if you plan on doing any of the reasonably challenging practice problems in the book."

And, as a side note, if you do need it, be aware that renting for the first semester will cost you only $16, but then extending that rental for another semester will cost you an additional $55. Unfortunately I am away from home and can't return it in time so much extend."
