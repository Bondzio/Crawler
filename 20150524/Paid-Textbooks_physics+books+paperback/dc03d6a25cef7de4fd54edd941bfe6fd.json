                "Text": "This review is short and sweet.  I read the book with great interest and was happy to take as probably genuine the accounts of strange phenomenon and the ability of some people to perform miracles or super-human feats.  That is until I reached page 150.  There I read about Sathya Sai Baba.  He has an enormous following and is said to perform miracles and conjure gifts out of thin air for his admiring followers.  This I found just a story too far.  A brief amount of investigation plus a look at some of the videos on YouTube was enough to convince me the man is a sleight of hand stage magician.  If Michael Talbot can be conned into  writing about such people with obvious reverence an awe it doesn't say much for the rest of the so called \"facts\" in this book.  I shall persevere to the end of the book as I have paid out good money but to say I'm disappointed is an understatement."

                "Text": "I have read this book over and over and though one may disagree with some of the conclusions reached by Michael Talbot, it is my opinion that he raised some crucial questions which science should look into and  investigate. It is easy to relegate some of these areas to the  \"occult\" mainly when one has not had some experiences which  science cannot explain. Many years ago, I had 2 dreams at 4 months interval  and in each of these dreams I had lost a sister. The day following each  dream I received message from home that the sister I dreamt about had  indeed died. I had no prior news that anyone of them was sick.  At that  time I was attending university about 2000 kms away from home. So how can  we explain this by science?  Michael Talbot views are very challenging and  I think that science should now investigate them dispassionately and sift  the shaft from the substance instead of throwing away everything off hand."

                "Text": "In short I found this book to be an intriguing possible explanation of what are often considered paranormal experiences in a more mundane context. Mass hysteria, out of body experiences, ESP, and even stigmata are all  dealt with as well many other wierd, supposedly occult or religious  occurences that have proven very palpable and \"real\" to  participants. This book does not attempt to validify belief in either a God  or the supernatural but merely explains how these mythological or  supernatural occurences, inconsistent with the laws of nature, could be  explained by interpreting existence and the universe as holographic in  nature. It is an extremely interesting read and has me redefining my views  on the physical and spiritual nature of reality and even my own ability to  control these things."

                "Text": "This book enjoys a respectable sales ranking at Amazon.com after nearly fifteen years in print, and for good reason.  It was decades ahead of its time, and the world is only now starting to catch up with the quantum theorists.  I am one of the Johnny-Come-Latelies to this field, and what an introduction it is!  If you saw the indie documentary What the Bleep Do We Know?!, here is the extra meat that you hungered for afterwards.  Talbot begins by introducing the scientists and their extraordinary evidence suggesting that our universe operates like a hologram.  Talbot does so in a highly readable way that non-scientists like me can easily understand.  From there, he demonstrates how all sorts of phenomena, from the mundane to the extraordinary, can be explained by the holographic model.  Every page is fascinating, and the author provides many resources for further exploration.  It is not often that a book comes along that can fundamentally change a person's view of reality overnight, and this is one of them.  I encourage everyone to catch up with the \"quantum folks.\"  This book is the perfect start."

                "Text": "I'll make this short.  Michael Talbot does a credible job of drawing parallels between religious concepts from different traditions and some of the basic ideas proposed by the field of quantum physics.  The provocative nature of his subject matter is a call for us all to go deeper into an inquiry about what it truly means to be human.  We are also well advised to explore more deeply what our responsiblities are as caretakers of this planet. The author seems to suggest that our best hope for survival lies in the development of our faculties of visualization.  Not only is Talbot's conclusion about this comforting; it also cries out for further exploration by anyone who thinks and occupies a physical body.  Skeptics and zealots may balk, but the fact remains that creativity flows most freely from an open mind.  If this book can inspire even a single person open up to greater possiblities, then this author and others need to keep generating a steady stream of this kind of material (especially since Talbot researched his information so meticulously)."

                "Text": "Everybody has a bias, including me, though we usually don't admit it.  Talbot, like many folks, early experienced the validity of what some like to think of as \"paranormal crap.\"  If you've had precognitive dreams, OBE, NDEs, etc., you get tired of people who think you're nuts, since you know what you've experienced, and you know what we call science and philosophy can be incredibly narrow-minded.  (See Stephen Braude's works for a philosophical discussion of this point.) That said, Talbot, now deceased, did, in the second part of his book, employ very little skepticism in his discussion of so many areas of paranormal reality.  However, the first part, where he discusses Bohm and Pribram, is about as lucid a discussion of holograms as I've seen in non-technical writings.  So: buy the book for a good discussion of Bohm and Pribram, and take the rest with a grain of salt (though only if you have a scientistic bias will you find ALL of the rest to be \"crap.\")"

The information presented here  is not new, nor does Mr. Talbot take credit for presenting any  revolutionary new theory. What Mr. Talbot does do, is bring together a  compendium of the vast resources of our past and current cultures and  present the distillation of those views in a highly readable and easily  digestable manner. This book cannot help but to change the life of the  reader if they have even an iota of receptiveness. The only readers who  will walk away unmoved by this work are those who lack the capacity to  assimilate ideas new to them or those who believe they already have. For  all the others, I highly praise this book."

The author died of leukemia in his 30's, unfortunately, but this is a significant legacy full of mind-expanding ideas which will lead you to read and learn more of reality and perception."

                "Text": "Talbot is obviously a very mystic person. He believes in almost every aspect of the psychic realm from hauntings to miraculous spontaneous healings to psychokinesis and \"mental time travel\". In this book, he covers every iota of psychic powers in a very detailed and methodical way, and relates those paranormal activities to his theory that the world is a hologram. After reading his argument, the theory definitely fits the problem and cannot be easily explained away. Of course, like all theories that seem definitive and true in the present, the future dictates which theories survive. Is it possible the universe is a hologram? Yes, but is it probable? Maybe. The most interesting chapter speaks of the incredible amount of evidence supporting spontaneous healing and the placebo effect. Essentially that there exists tons of evidence of healing through faith and the mind, belief that one can and will be healed...even diseases such as cancer. It may be a far stretch to relate healing to a holographic reality but Talbot does a fine job covering the bases. Very interesting and thought-provoking. Especially for those who are thirsty for knowledge and humbly admit that everyone has knowledge to share."

                "Text": "This book will really get you contemplating !!!  The Holographic Universe is a new \"Theory of Everything.\"  Most models of the natural macrocosm need to reject paranormalism.  (hence the use of the word NATURAL)  This model has room to let in just about any phenomenon.  A bit like, \"You name it, and the holomovement explains it.\"  There's even some room for synchronicity =)  It will be opposed by the more conservative scientists but the model is actually alot more sufficient and satisfactory than their own Cosmologies.  I think this book is going to be met with loads of skepticism by the higher authorities. But judging by Talbot's writing, he doesn't seem too affrighted by this matter.  Perhaps they won't be opposing holographic hypothesises in general, however a physics book about NDE's, UFO's, Stigmata and Mysticism.. to his own personal werewolf transformations and trickster poltergeists.  Things like this shall certainly feed chuckles to a skeptic's belly, but I really hope that before they dismiss them they realize the implications of the Holographic Universe Theory.  That in it, a  reality comprised less of solid objects traveling in space & time, and more of ghostly holograms of energy sustained by processes that are at least partially connected to human consciousness, miracles ARE possible, even \"natural\" (and I suppose therefore not actually 'miracles' in the religious sense) The broad purport is that our brains mathematically construct objective reality by interpreting frequencies that are ultimately projections from another dimension, a deeper order of existence that is beyond both space and time:  The brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic universe. I found the latter portion of the book pertaining to dreams and OBE's as fascinating, and how remarkably these things were described in comparison between the traditions of the ancients in their own writings and philosophy.  I really must recommend this work to just about anyone for a brand new alternative perspective on the nature of \"REALITY\"  !!!!"

However, after the first 80 or so pages, it gets somewhat off topic i think. It goes on through out the rest of the book about how this holographic view can be used to describe a bunch of mystical things that have happened throughout history.  While it is a cool topic to talk about, some of the stories seem kind of unrealistic. If even half of the stories in this book ARE true however, this would make for an amazingly complicated and fantastic world.  Would i recommend this book? If you like to read this kind of stuff (like i do) i would say yes!  Besides... it's paperback and so it doesn't cost much to give it a try! :)"

No, not really. I look at it as this cool, fun and this new way to wonder at the possibility of these things. This book isn't going to \"answer\" all your questions, but for some it will. And others just leave you to ponder your way to a conclusion you think is right. I read it because the backbone to this story (aka the title) is itself super trippy!

                "Text": "I originally posted a 2-star review of this book in February of 2001. I found it too far out to be taken seriously. Since then, I've read a great deal on the evidence for paranormal phenomena, and my thinking on the subject has changed a lot. Rereading \"The Holographic Universe\" recently, I found that many of my earlier objections had melted away. Talbot still relies on some dubious examples - as another reader points out, the Indian mystic Sai Baba has been thoroughly discredited, yet Talbot takes him quite seriously. Talbot also shares some of his personal experiences, which can be pretty hard to swallow. Nevertheless, much of what he discusses is based on solid research in areas like out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, and so forth. Talbot's integration of this material with the Pribam model of a holographic mind and the Bohm model of an implicate order is fresh, original, and provocative. His book is consistently well written, and he summarizes a great deal of information in a clear, concise way, while making some complex scientific concepts easily understandable. Don't be too put off by the scoffing skeptics. There's some neat stuff in here."

                "Text": "Michael Talbot's \"The Holographic Universe\" is in a word fascinating. Before reading this book I read and reread \"Seth Speaks\" by Jane Roberts. Speaking through channeler Jane Roberts, Seth an entity no longer inhabiting planet Earth explains the \"Nature of Reality\". There are many common denominators between the two books. Most importantly perhaps is that mind creates reality not vice versa. Both books also talk about the realities underlying our existence and how time and space is but an illusion, and that we live many lives and prepare for each life before we are born. Seth Speaks is more of a text book in that he gives detail in \"lessons\" while Talbots book gives instances and anecdotal evidence. It being the new year I think I'll resolve (yet again) to seek from within the secrets withheld from our conscious mind. Caveat Emptor, be prepared to meet some personal demons along the way. We are too focused in this world. Any new forays into the unknown can be frightening. Imagine finding onesself in the midst of an OBE (out of body experience) and not knowing if you'll make it back. If you're one who can remember dreams this book may make you want to seek a deeper understanding of your dreams. I have taken many trips in my dreams but it would be nice if I could take such journeys consciously. The conscious mind, however, likes to be in control and fears losing it, at least to me. Anyway, it's a fascinating book. I suggest you read both Seth Speaks and The Holographic Universe."

This book is a breeze to read, and can be easily understood even by those with no scientific background.  What is real?  No-one knows for sure -- physicists, astronomers, and microbiologists surely don't!  The more we \"learn\" about the universe, the more puzzling things become.  Why does the new data fail to make sense?  Perhaps science has been wrong all along?  It would seem that we reside in a multidimensional world, of which we are only partially aware -- walking around \"blind\", if you will.  So much is constantly going on around us that the human eye cannot percieve -- and many things that it can percieve the brain fails to comprehend.  The world is an illusion!  Stop trying to over-analyze everything and just relax . . . it's all-good."

                "Text": "Talbot's book reads like a pot-boiler.  I think I read it two sittings (the only other book that I read so fast was The Amityville Horror in 1978!).  Talbot weaves his theory that the universe is a hologram around findings in neuroscience and particle physics.  He then brings in every paranormal phenomenon one can think of to fit into this theory - reincarnation, out of body experiences, ESP, UFOs, psychokinesis, etc. etc.  This is both the strength and the weakness of the book.  While having a theory that describes all of these phenomena is like finding the Rosetta Stone, I found myself thirsting for alternative explanations as well, just to get a comparison.  But still, Talbot's book is a page-turner and is recommended."

It is scientific and if you liked movies like the matrix and the 13th floor...and want to know about reasearch in mysticism and OBE(Out of body experience = astral travel) and \"miracles\" this book is it! Actually there are so many experiments and research done in these aspects you would be surprised. Out of the 100s of books i have read on Spiritualism and quantum physics this is a MUST have. It is a bridge between the 2. This has got to be the best book on these subjects bridging the gap between the implicate and the explicate orders (material and spiritual worlds). The Holographic concept works and you will be experiencing reality in a new perspective. The book caused many astral trips for me! I had another me carry off to another place...i wont say more because many people have negative ideas about such experiences and call the hallucinations. Academic research is out there for you to look at and this book will lead you and tell you who to contact; institutions, healers, psychics, OBE schools....etc. I cant recommend it enough ! 7 stars all the way!!!!!!!!"

Talbot quoted the experts, and he revealed his personal experiences. He talked about psi phenomena, he was psychic, and talked about the research in that area. Talbot tied all of that together in one neat and very inspiring package. The Holographic Universe is now my number one favorite book!"

The claims that are made are backed up by numerous scientific studies, but it doesn't blow you away with scientific jargon. It's written in an easy-to-read style and the different chapters are split up into subsections, which also helps. Michael Talbot explains what a hologram is and then goes on to argue that the holographic model can be used to explain multiple personality disorders (extraordinary! - if you know nothing about MPD, then you absolutely must read this section), psychokinesis, miracles, the human energy field (or energy bodies), past/present/future existing seemlessly together, near death experiences (NDEs), UFO sightings and much more.  Whether you accept the holographic theory or not, just reading the results of the various scientific studies mentioned in the book is fascinating and for me, personally, as a poet and author, it was also inspiring. The idea that everything is interconnected in this holographic universe of ours and is part of the same continuum inspired me, for example, to write a poem called 'My Life' to try and make sense of it ('...all that I see and don't see, hear and don't hear, touch and don't touch, smell and don't smell, taste and don't taste I am - I am the eternal energy of everything...'), whilst the story of the woman in the NDE chapter who said that 'she hadn't danced enough yet', making the being of light she was talking to laugh heartily and enabling her to return to physical life, gave me an idea for a children's story. In short, I found the book riveting and inspirational - jam-packed full of extraordinary scientific fact way more mind-blowing and thrilling than any science fiction I've ever read - and I am now reading it for a second time and will probably read it a third and fourth time as well!"

Science has evolved to a point where it is understood AND accepted, that there are occurences that cannot be explained via the typical routs of analysis and observation. THIS IS THE POINT TO THIS BOOK. Not that these possibilities discussed in The Holographic Universe are supposed to be scientifically proven. Those who give this reading anything lower than 4 stars are in the unfortunate classification of what the author is explicitely stating...BOUNDED BY LAWS that they feel comfortable with. Proven, replicated, observed, and measured variables. This is NOT where science is heading NOR has it been since these models discussed have come to fruition. Point being: If you are a scientist, philosopher, psychologist, theologist, humanist, mystic, or basically someone who is willing to be open to the vastness of the how and why...whether on a professional level OR amature as myself....you will find this reading inexpendible in its assumptions. I personally think Talbot has expressed VERY CLEARLY a possible connection to how everything may be interconnected with examples laid down since the beginnings of these theories. I look forward to reading more books by Talbot AND the underlying principles of what is becoming more and more accepted within the theories of Quantum (theories) possibilities. Enjoy."

I was a total skeptic, but after seeing so many cops, who were also skeptics, and even some cops who were psychics, do the impossible, I had to acknowledge something unexplainable was happening. I needed a new set of scientific ideas. I felt like Pasteur discovering that yeast was a creature. I don't know if the holograph is the complete answer, but it's a start. If you have any interest in psychics at all, you must read this book. It brings together many psychic events with the best scientific evidence available to get your brain going. It's a sensible, well written book that presents what evidence there is (well annotated), in a readable, interesting easy to follow structure. It's a great jumping off point to try to figure out how people do things that they shouldn't be able to do. That used to keep me up at night scratching my head. And there is no hostility to religion here, either, which I really appreciated. I'm so tired of science and religion acting like they are mutually exclusive disciplines."

It was recommended by my daughter after I went into a time of life when I was really interested in spiritual matters (I was just over 60 then). It made a difference in my thinking then and recently my wife and I started reading it again, together. She had heard me reference it so many times in conversations with others, she decided she wanted to know more. I had had a personal experience with the phenomenon of mind-over-matter following an accident and it was illuminating to learn of others that had similar experiences. If you are not threatened to explore spirituality in a broad sense you will be enlightened by the thoughts in this well documented book. It was written for the lay person and does an excellent job of describing and unifying recent developments in physics, biology, psychology and philosophy."

By reading \"The Holographic Universe\", a person can at least be exposed to the way things really are and then decide using her own intellect what she wants to believe.

                "Text": "This is an extraordinary study. To begin with, the author not just has done an extensive study within the vast realm of psychic phenomena, he also, similar to Fritjof Capra, has consulted personally a number of researchers he mentions in his book. Myself a researcher, I know well that there is a difference between knowing a given research from a book, or to be able to interview the author, and thus gain insight into the human experience that is behind the book or research. I have seldom read a study that was both so well-researched and well-written as this book. As Talbot reveals in a few notes, and rather modestly, he has himself strong psychic abilities and was a psychic already as a child. This may explain in part his 'participatory' experience as a scientist and his fundamental comprehension of the topics at stake. Talbot makes a strong point for the holographic nature of the universe and of psychic experiences in general, and I can virtually not see how his theory can be refuted, so well-founded it appears. It just makes sense of so much material that at first sight seems scattered or even completely inconsistent, such as, for example, UFO sightings and alien abduction experiences. Under the header of the holographic view of the universe, not only such experiences, but also so apparently different subjects as Jewish Cabala and Bohm's implicate order interpretation of quantum physics perfectly and intelligently correspond to each other. While I recommend this book without hesitation for the general reader, it should be an advantage to have read previously some kind of fundamental introduction in the new paradigms in science, such as, for example, Fritjof Capra's 'The Turning Point'."

                "Text": "Michael Talbot in \"The Holographic Universe\" (1991) anticipates science and technology light-years to the fore. With a model of the cosmos that is both practical and self-explanatory, the author posits simply that we exist in a hologram, and that we ourselves are holographic. The mystics have said, \"Nothing is real.\" Talbot's work does take a mystical turn, but it is by no means fanciful. The physicists at Princeton were, for all intents and purposes, Euclidean in their thinking; their theories required a rigid, mechanical model with well-defined elements that behaved in highly predictable ways. The notion that particles could and would shape-shift or morph into waves at esoteric will was either little known or scarcely believed. The implications of this model for medicine are fairly covered by the author, and explanations are given as to the phenomena of \"phantom limbs\" and total-recall memory.This is based in infinite storage (even where those centers of the brain that are associated with memory have been excised) because a hologram contains copies within copies of itself. On the other hand, the implications for science--some twenty-four years after the fact--are beginning to transpire. A safe bet for the future of cyber technology is that devices will stop shrinking and disappear altogether, and that worlds more \"virtual\" than we thought possible are on the horizon."

This book is filled with *fascinating* anecdotes, historical stories and information, and recountings of rigorous scientific studies that have come to some surprising conclusions.  The only possible critique I could offer is that in some places, how what is being discussed relates to \"holographic\" theory is either not clearly defined, or seems to me to have a coincidential resembelance at best.  But then, given that this is still a theory very much in it's infancy, that's to be expected.  Get it now!"

It is a well thought out, well written treatise on the possible implications of a holographic universe.  Clearly, scientific materialists are not going to like this book as it speaks of things that can't be seen or measured, but what the hell is wrong with some discussion, some insight, inspiration, a \"leap of faith\" just to get the creative juices flowing?!  I found this to be an exhilarating read."

I immediately went out and bought this book and though it's in the science section, it may very well be in the paranormal section.  An interesting and intriguing read!

I've  felt for a long time that science would eventually come to support what  religions have taught for years... This book is a step in that direction!"

However, I find that the scientific coverage is sketchy and in the initial chapters - psychological aspects are better covered than the physics. The latter part of the book is devoloped on the twilight theme of attempting to link spiritual experience(s) of various types, into an analytical framework. This attempt may be acceptable only to a person who is in the 'believer' or 'neutral' context, since the science linkage is not too strong."

Although there are a few topics with other possible interpretations (if, on a subatomic level, time does not exist and it is a construct of the mind, how can there be reincarnation?

I believe there are other explanations for the reincarnation phenomena), this is a well researched book that draws excellent conclusions.

It is only in fairly recent times that the god of science has reigned with such an iron fist; of course, we are living in a society that is the product of scientific discovery, but what is your perception of this society? Why do we look to science to offer explanations for our experiences? This book seeks to explore a model of our universe and all that is in it, in such a way that is both readable and vast in its substance. Here we have a link between up-to-the minute scientific discovery and that which has been the opposite end of the spectrum, magic and mysticism. As an astrologer, my interest is to explore the connectivity between perception and events within the framework of the cosmos. The Aquarian Age is as much about breaking down barriers and creating new paradigms, and now with the advent of technological communication at an unprecedented level, we are able to make those important links. I love the way this book is inclusive of those subects usually rejected by science and is able to grasp the nettle of  some thorny exceptions to a scientific straitjacket."

This book contains some of the most revolutionary ideas I've ever seen and comes off not sounding (for the most part) like it was written by a guy who's done way too many drugs.  Contained within its pages are the answers to problems of physics, philosophy, religion, and probaly who killed JFK if you look hard enough.  The only problem is much of what Talbot says can never be proven. Think of reality as being a wave and what we can see and understand is simply the crest.

The author was very repetitive and it could definitely have used some editing. He seemed to be able to nicely tie all the phenomenon he wrote about back to his holographic model, but some phenomenon he wrote of was suspect to say the least. It is unfortunate because it puts into question the entire premise. The book is also a little bit dated as far as realistic theories for the universe and the mind. The most interesting part was the descriptions of different phenomenon, but it was also the most damning. I can't say that I would recommend the book unless I was doing so as a nice summary of many different aspects of the paranormal."

                "Text": "When I originally purchased and began to read Talbot's presentation, I was intrigued by the way he proposed to explain some of the mysterious or unexplained phenomena of the past and present through an honest inquiry. He  applied a blend of both scientific theory and speculations from traditional  mysticism to the table. He includes discussions of some of the stranger  aspects of quantum physics that have challenged modern physicists with  their counter-intuitiveness and introduces the concept of the HOLOGRAPH as  a possible model of reality. Yet he feels the need to combine these points  with paranormal or \"supernatural\" mysteries from the past, as  well as his own experiences. In the end, however, he clearly veers towards  his own assumptions and uncritically accepts much of the dubious  superstitions and supernatural claims of less enlightened historical times.  He does not actually present any real evidence for his argument or  hypothesis, but descends into personal anecdotes (i.e. unverified claims)  about his own bizzare \"experiences\"(hallucinations?). The book is  interesting up to a point, but quickly degenerates into yet another  \"New Age\" attempt to elevate magical-spiritual-supernatural  nonsense to the level of legitimate and testable science. Very unfortunate  indeed."

An inventive new model of the physical universe based on the ideas of two of worlds leading scientists, that could help better explain the architecture of reality itself and the existence of parellel universes by relating it to the principal of how a hologram works. Pretty neat! I definately recomend reading the first two chapters at least. From here it gets really (I thought) weird. He seems to find a way to relate the holographic model to everything under the sun, from the placebo effect, the afterlife, Hinduism, yogis and eastern phliosophy (which he seems to relate all but the first two chapters too), and even miricals and UFO's. Most of what we don't understand about reality such as visions (ie of Christ, Saints, ect.) and ghost sitings (ie the paranormal) is usually chalked up as the result of the manifestation of a person's subconsious, projected outside their body, and probobly not real, (according to Talbot.) But things and visions revealed under hypnosis or meditation (yes, meditative visions are often presented in this book) have very deep validity and meaning. I found this to be a bit biased. However, if you're into this kind of thing, this is the book for you."

Concealing my psychic ability buried  my inspiration and my creativity with it. I have now gone through the most  wonderful life change.  Artists today,always complain that they can't find  inspiration. Inspiration, consciousness, spirituality, creativity and  psychic abilities are all there inside everyone.

We are very much connected to one another and we share more than we recognize in this very materialistic, tactile world.  It is wonderfull to be alive in a era that recognizes our humanity,togetherness, despite living concurrently in a era that seems to feel that war remains a viable instrument to impact people.

Amongst all the scientific giants of astrophysics, laid this book. The publication date said 2011, the title was right and the book it was with were right. Having not read the book description carefully enough, I end up with this scientifically ancient book (copyright 1991) that is mostly filled with hokum and the left field of pseudoscience. Not to mention, when I search for a book on \"holographic principle of the universe\" I have to wade through dozens of other New Age mumbo jumbo books not about real science at all because of the bandwagon of new age authors using the holographic principle as a launch pad for all kinds of unsupported superstitions. Talbot, you have ruined the name \"Holographic Principle\". The only other book on the topic that was **actually** written in the last five years and is scientifically sound is by Leonard Susskind and filled with advanced physics equations and jargon beyond my reckoning. I have a Ph.D. in chemistry. Talbot's \"The Holographic Universe\" book is not a good science book for scientists or laypersons. I wish someone would write a good, scientifically reasonable book about the holographic universe for laypeople. Perhaps I will have to learn General Relativity math first and read Susskind's book."

The state of mind I've put my self in through my sessions is one of a high faithful optimistic researcher. In with the \"solution\" (otherwise known to all as LSD)I discovered that at times the visual you project out of your mind is coming directly from the expiramenter. The powers of the astonishing wave moments come through with this particular solution from strong imaginative emotions. As with the explicate order, here in this other realm we are taught that the powers of the mind are so potenent that they are capable of projecting and materializing anything and shutting out the principles of science and how matter works. Gravity is a formal pull, and as we are told of psychokenesis, we may be able to even move gravity out of our way and float away like a feather in space. To make this theory clearer we  must give ourselves the understanding that the energy field and particles making up gravity posses a certain kind of consciousness that we as human beings in our normal state of mind, cannot comprehend. Through inside the implicate with the solution we can somehow place ourselves in gravity's place putting ourselves vulnerable and capable of being gravity itself and literally possesing its traits. If an interconnection is installed through such an exercise the expectations should be classified as \"Limitless\" and \"Unpredictable\" leading to many phenomenal occurences such as an outer-body experience or a \"New emotion-finding\". When under the influence of LSD we give out so many different emotions through us. I believe these hard built emotions are emotions we probably once had in another life or maybe an emotion we posses through our unconcious selves. When touched through by LSD our brain functions at the equivalence of our dream like state clinically proving us unconcious or sometimes by these raging critics, \"Insane\". What's being projected out of our mind through the experience is whatever we profoundly percieve to be there or whatever we're thinking, and even what our \"Focal Point\" reminds us of. The focal point in an LSD session is simply where you're setting your stable sight on. For example,picture yourself looking at a sink and its faucet;depending on how strong you mind works and how strong your visual aids are will be the results of your \"Out total projected image\" that shocks you. It should not only be the image through your sight that is so shocking,but all those other senses should be shocked also. The shock should be composed either by a theory of that faucet's past, present, or future, or even how that faucet feels about everything.Many times I find myself not being able to project what an object feels about everything. So instead I simply find out how it physically feels. This itself \"For now\" is a brilliant data to my collection for my spirit and its skills. Skills are formatted by beliefs and faith. If you believe it can, then it will under the proper circumstances and under the right process taken."

But this is really not science at all; maybe it's a precursor to the science, but just as likely, it's the highly-inflated aftermath of a night of unusually good weed, captured and edited into publishibility before it could waft skyward, as weed was meant to. This is Talbot's real legacy to the literature of the paranormal. How did he do it? Why can't I do it? I've got to *try*..."

In this case, the hologram is strutted across the stage as a governing principle of the  universe.  It explains everything and therefore explains nothing.  One  seems to forget that paradigms are a dirty word in science.  They block  inquiry, prejudice experience and bind the intuition into a straight jacket  of facile panaceas.  For those who wish to feed their occult conceits with  poorly substantiated scientific half-trues then this book is for you.  If  your mind seeks knowledge through skepticism and open inquiry, then pass  this one over."

First of all, the interest in higher dimensions has permeated all of mathematics and physics for about 100 years.  So it's amazing that at this late date someone can come along and say \"the universe may have higher dimensions\" and still be applauded as a visionary.  The idea may indeed be profound, but it is certainly not novel.  (See \"Flatland\" for starters.)  Second, the idea of holographic or distributed memory has been chewed-on and digested both in the fields of artificial neural networks and cognitive psychology.  Consult any one of the hundreds of recent textbooks in these fields for the details.  For myself, I'll look forward to reading Talbot's book, but based on the other reviews I can't say that the anticipation is killing me."
