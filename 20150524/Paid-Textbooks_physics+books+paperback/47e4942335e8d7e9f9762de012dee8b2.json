                "Text": "I have used the previous edition of this book for years and loved it.  I actually use it in my Integrated Physics and Chemistry class.  While I don't use every chapter, many of the chapters like motion, force, energy, and electricity are ideal for a lower level physics class. Her questions are cute and funny and the examples prior to the worksheets are IDEAL.  They work problems just like the ones in the workbook."
