The examples are not helpful and do not help to solidify the concepts taught in each chapter. I would recommend that students who are required to purchase this textbook to also purchase a supplementary text because, from experience, I know that this text was not enough to teach me physics in an easy and efficient manner."

I feel there are some things that it could explain a little better though, in reading.  Especially for a user who has no physics and a weak math background (which is pretty much why we're taking this course, yes?)."
