The explanations provided in the book are actually very good - they are very well written, accessible to the general audience, and absolutely conceptually correct. This last point should not be taken for granted, as I have seen many attempts at making Physics accessible to the general audience that don't actually do justice to the actual Physics. One thing that I in particular like about this book is that it mentions several more recent experiments that have shed important light at the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics.

As far as introductory, non-technical books on quantum mechanics go, this one clearly hits its targeted audience."

                "Text": "I'm in med school right now and one thing I never understood while taking the required scientific classes in high school or undergrad was what the heck physics was about.  Math, biology, chemistry were all comparatively easy, but physics always evaded my understanding.  While this book by no means brought me to a level of knowledge comparable to even a 1st year physics student in undergrad, it at least helped me fill part of the void of the one science that I could never grasp.  This gave me at least some tid-bits to help start or carry on a conversation about the topic, whereas I had nothing to go on before (and I wasn't going to pick up a text-book to fill the void in the first place).  This was a great overview of the subject written in lay-mans terms and explained in \"lay-man language\".  I'm thinking of reading Hawkings' books right now as they seem to have the same fundamentals of explaining really hard to grasp physics to a larger audience as this book has.  I recommend this book!"

I bought it anyway as I found the concept intriguing.  And I was rewarded with a nice read from an effective and funny educator.

It proved to be both, although as the book progressed I abandoned reading it with my daughter as the concepts become increasingly esoteric, and steadily harder to explain... nevertheless, a thorough and engaging book, starting from the basics and working up, and I am looking forward to reading Orzel's book on relativity next...

The dog from the title is author's German shepherd, and she is used as a stand-in for all the na\u00efve, \"Newtonian\" ways of thinking about the world. Each chapter in the book covers a different aspect of quantum theory, and all the discussions are motivated in a light-hearted way by author's \"dialogues\" with his dog. These \"dialogues\" are meant to provide some comic relief from the otherwise technical subject matter. As such they work fine, although I am not the biggest fan of author's attempts at humor. The explanations provided in the book are actually very good - they are very well written, accessible to the general audience, and absolutely conceptually correct. This last point should not be taken for granted, as I have seen many attempts at making Physics accessible to the general audience that don't actually do justice to the actual Physics. One thing that I in particular like about this book is that it mentions several more recent experiments that have shed important light at the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics. In that respect this popular treatment is as up-to-date as they come. As a college Physics professor myself, I appreciate all the effort that the author has put into making this material accessible. As far as introductory, non-technical books on quantum mechanics go, this one clearly hits its targeted audience."

                "Text": "There is perhaps no area of Physics that has garnered as much fascination as quantum mechanics, save perhaps the theory of relativity. Yet in a sense the weirdness associated with quantum mechanics is even more profound than that associated with relativity. Relativity deals with physics of very fast objects, and even though it challenges our normal way of thinking, it still preserves some of the basic intuitions of what does it mean to be a physical object, how we measure properties of those objects, and what those objects can and cannot do. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, puts all those basic notion to a test. We are forced to reconsider even our basic understanding of what reality is.

                "Text": "How to Teach Physics to Your Dog presents Quantum Mechanics to the layperson. As Quantum Mechanics is very complex and its results often counter-intuitive, this is no easy task. Having read several introductory books on Quantum Mechanics, I can say that the author did a very good job with this book, especially in regards to portraying the counter-intuitive aspects of Quantum Mechanics. The author presents the material as a dialogue between his \"talking\" pet dog and himself. Basically, at the start of every chapter, the dog comes in with a new question about physics and the author provides an answer. In addition there are comments, many times funny, made by the dog throughout each chapter. I felt this device was useful in two ways, one, the humorous comments make for some light relief amid the difficult subject matter, and, more importantly, the questions put forth by the dog, named Emmy by the way, are sometimes questions that I would have asked had I been there. In each chapter, the author presents one part of Quantum Mechanics, focusing on the conceptual aspects of each sub topic. Mathematical notation and the notation of physics are mostly absent but there are a lot of diagrams including Feynman Diagrams (used to explain aspects of Quantum Electrodynamics and Virtual Particles). Other topics covered are: the particle-wave  duality of light, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the Copenhagen and Many Worlds Interpretation, The Quantum Zeno Effect, Quantum Tunneling, and Quantum Entanglement. I really liked this book. I found myself reading sections several times over to get the most out of it. I feel that I have really enhanced my understanding of Quantum Mechanics. If you are looking for a conceptual introduction to Quantum Mechanics, I highly recommend this book, it will not swamp you in detail and the explanations are really good. This coupled with the light relief offered by the dog, and occasional allusions to the history of the subject, make for a fun and informative read."

I never took physics in college or even high school, but my sister is an engineer, and I thought maybe I could pick up a few key words to drop into a conversation to impress her.  And I love dogs.  I can't say I can even begin to understand quantum physics or quantum mechanics, but I love the dog Emmy, and I might be getting the hang of quantum dog bones.  Obviously you have to have some background knowledge and familiarity with physics to be a fair judge of this book.  However, it does seem that the analogies used with bunnies, squirrels, steak and dog bones to help Emmy understand the concepts must surely also help physics students as well.  I still don't understand physics, but I like the dog and the interaction between her and Orzel so much, that I am already 3/4 of the way through the book.  I am buying 2 copies as presents: one for a friend whose son is a nuclear physicist (so she can also pick up some buzz words) and one for my sister, the engineer, who is also a dog lover.  Perhaps if I had had a teacher like Orzel, physics would have appealed to me."

And this book does it in an amusing way -- a series of tongue-in-cheek conversations in which the author explains quatum physics (quantum mechanics) to his dog.  As the author states, in some ways, dogs are better suited than humans to understand quantum mechanics, because they don't come equipped with certain assumptions which people do.  Assumptions which may be valid on a macroscale, but not valid on the tiny scale of atomic particles.  Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the topic.  It is suitable for people with a wide range of knowledge about physics.  Different people will get different things out of it, despending on their current level of understanding of quantum physics and physics in general.  Quantum physics is not a simple subject and the book requires thought and attention when read.  It is also an entertaining read.  Highly recommended.  I've already given a copy as a gift and will be giving more."

I was hoping for--and got--a decent layman's understanding of the basic concepts of quantum physics from this book (I think having been a dog lover for all of my life and a dog owner for most of it helped me). The concept of explaining physics by using analogies of dogs chasing rabbits may seem too cute by half, and, okay, as I wrote in my opening statement, at times it is. But if you want a physics book that is a). readable without putting you to sleep or making you feel like your brain will explode, and b). actually teaches you something, I recommend this book. If you also read Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, as I did after reading this, you will know even more (just remember the old saying: if you think you understand quantum theory, you REALLY don't understand quantum theory!)."

The book is directed at the physics novice, and the author does a nice job of describing a very complicated topic by pretending to discuss it with his dog.  I found the discussion with the dog gave the author easy to understand examples that could help to explain the very difficult quantum physics topics.  For example, using a bunny rabbit in a yard as an example of a subatomic particle.  In the book, the author covers the topics of 1) How an item can act as both a particle and a wave. 2) How it is impossible to tell both the position and momentum of a particle. 3)The idea of many worlds. 4)Teleportation. And several other things related to quantum physics.  I came away from the book entertained and with some basic knowledge about a very complicated area of science.  That was just what I wanted."
