                "Text": "This is an extraordinary book. It teaches physics concepts by reference to superhero comic books (mostly from the late 50s and 60s, which just happens to be when I was a comic book junkie). The author writes with a delightfully engaging and humorous style; I laughed out loud frequently when reading this book. Notwithstanding the humor, he manages to impart a good understanding of basic physics concepts in a painless way. Quite a lot of topics are covered: mechanics, electricity, magnetism, fluid mechanics, relativity, etc. Panels of actual comics appear as figures in the book, and I was amused to see that even fifty years after reading them as a kid, I recognized some of them. If you're taking (or teaching!) a freshman course in physics, this would be a great book for supplemental reading. (I'd love to sit in on the course Kakalios teaches that inspired this book.)  It is very highly recommended; in fact it is one of the very best \"science for laypeople\" books that I have ever read."

                "Text": "\"The Physics Of Superheroes\" by Jim Kakalios superbly explains the understanding of physics in a fun and new way.  This terrific book demonstrates a number of important points.  Physics is not an easy subject, but Jim Kakalios helps people have a better understanding of the book.  It is not a book just for comic book lovers, but it is a book for people who do not understand comic books also. Who doesn't want to be a superhero?  This book realizes the aspects of superheroes and other comic book characters.  The author has written a book by combining his love for physics with his love of comic books.  He has written a book for the general reader covering all of the basic points in a first-level college physics course and is difficult to put down. Kakalios also helps explain that gravity is at least 15 times greater on Krypton than here on Earth.  He also explains the bad things about Spidey's web and how it cannot save people because of the abrupt stop and roughness of the web. Kakalios covers many topics such as electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, string theory and thermodynamics.  He keeps you interested and sometimes even laughing throughout the book.  I am not a comic book fan or physics fan, but this book is much more than that."

                "Text": "This book was hilarious! I laughed a lot while reading it and contemplating on the wide spread of concepts that were brought up with a Kakalios perspective on their suits.  One of the most interesting examples he used were about the comic superhero Flash.  He discussed how it was possible for flash to run on water, run up buildings, create a sonic -boom,  hear things at ridiculously high frequencies, smack the bad guys in the face with a wave front and even run faster than the words he says.  If that was not enough to satisfy your curiosity, he also explains how it might be possible for flash to speed through walls with no effect on him or the wall and to vibrate so fast to be able to melt a huge amount of ice.  But, the real question we should be asking ourselves is how many big-mac's would Flash have to eat to supply him with enough energy to accomplish these feats?  If you want to be able to calculate such a feat, you should read this book!"

It turns out this book has a great balance of comical writing (no pun intended), but it also has a lot of factual information.

I would recommend the to anyone from the 10th grade and up. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger, not because it was hard to read, but because they probably haven't learned any of the concepts spoken about in this books."
