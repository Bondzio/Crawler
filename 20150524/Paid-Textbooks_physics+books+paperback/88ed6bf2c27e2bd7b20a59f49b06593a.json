                "Text": "Professor Lou is an outstanding teacher and his lessons come alive in his books.  THIS IS NOT THE CURRENT EDITION.  I knew that when I bought it because, as an educator, I was interested in the concepts and the physics did not change between editions.  This book (this edition or newer ones) would be a benefit to science teachers, home schoolers, science students (probably middle school to lower part of high school), and anyone interested in understanding the physics around everyday life.  Science in HS was boring to many -- Lou brings it alive and makes it easy to understand.  And without lots of math :)"

Kudos to the author for taking such good examples of things that we use in our everyday lives that we take for granted to always work. And tying them to the real concepts of physics with very detailed explanations. Exactly what i was looking for and the price was even better on Amazon."

I wish that it would be published in Kindle format so I could carry it around and hold it more easily. Reading this book would help Mechanical Engineering students understand what they are being taught in class.  I would recommend reading this before taking Physics and Statics. I homeschool my two sons. They are in high school now and we do robotics.  I am going to have them read this over the summer."

My review is this: The pictures are in black and white and drawn, the pages are so damn annoying to flip through as the paper is extremely fine and thin and hard to get a hold of. 2 subjects where this book does not cover is no mention of computers or the brain. What this book does mention does so in advanced grammar so the layman will find it hard to understand or comprehend what the author is saying and they will give up and try another subject of the book to find it's no different. All the positive reviews I find suspicious or maybe there all rocket scientists or brain surgeons. Stay the hell away from this book. I'm returning it even though I'll be losing half the money I spent, which is better than using this as a $16 paperweight."
