                "Text": "This is, perhaps, one of the most man-made idea of Yahweh I've ever read, mixing the religion and ideologies of Zen and other religions WITH the Scriptures. Benner's ideas in this book take a piece of Scripture from Genesis and teaches its readers that the correct understanding comes by way of looking through the eyes of Buddhism, rather than looking through the establishment of \"2 or 3 witnesses\" in Scripture. This is very disappointing coming from Benner. This book is nothing more than than man-made fantasy, and by this he has made himself a false teacher, which is unfortunate given his amazing previous works."
