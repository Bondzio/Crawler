                "Text": "This edition cleans up alot of the typos in the previous version and also cleans up the format as well.  As such, it makes a previously useful but carelessely edited book very wortwhile.  Importantly, this book should be used as an adjunct to a major textbook (I used Shankar, for example), and not as the primary learning tool itself.  However, if used in this fashion, it can provide some very concise and useful review.  The problems are very useful and in fact logically help build up the theoretical foundation of the subject.  For the price, I certainly think this second edition is worth it."

                "Text": "I find that Schaums books range from ones that can be used almost as textbooks, to those which are very, very abbreviated and possibly useful as an aide-memoire for those familiar with the material. If the latter is what you are looking for, go ahead. I just wanted a brief overview to put into perspective some concepts that I have read about in my mathematics and other study, and this didn't really do the job. I think its appeal is limited, admittedly though there are not a lot of options for introductory but reasonably rigorous material."
