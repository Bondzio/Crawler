                "Text": "Even though these lectures are more than 20 years old, Feynman did an incredible job of explaining a fundamental concept in Physics.  I can see now why he received the Nobel prize for his work in this area.  I would call him the Carl Sagan of Physics, except that Mr. Sagan's popularity came later in time.  QED is so bizarre and incredible, yet so accurate and powerful a theory that it boggles the mind!  Mr. Feynman's explanation is so complete and articulate that anyone can understand it.  This theory explains the physical underpinnings of most of our daily experience, the interactions of photons with matter, yet it is a complete surprise!"

It's short, terse, and brilliantly clear. Feynman must have tried to explain quantum mechanics to an awful lot of people over his career - he certainly got very good at it. Then, he wrote it down in this book. All the analogies are perfect and clear, all the explanations are pithy but understandable. Feynman isn't trying to dazzle you with his knowledge - he's trying to move knowledge from his brain to yours, and he succeeds."

Like Einstein's THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS the content of QED might be  relavent to those interested in physics but the ways in which the problems are attacked constitute a  textbook on how to think creatively.  These lectures are really about how to develop cognitive strategies and point out that skills are sort of useless if one doesn't have the strategies by which they are appropriately employed."

The book tells you what complex numbers (those things that you learned in high school) are for (amongst other things of course).  It also tempts you to interpret the quantum nature of light - but you have also been warned by Feynman not to (page 9).  You will have the chance of having Feynman himself explaining Feynman diagrams.  You will learn that things can travel backwards in time (page 97) - or do they? You will also comprehend how all the three forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong) are inter-related (pages 136-142).  And towards the end, Feynman will try to marvel you with the elegance of nature and its imbued mystery.  Truly a masterpiece!"

The book is compelling not because he is a great explainer but because he seems to fundamentally understand more clearly. So he has no fear in describing the limits of theories or knowledge - many popularizers are not true scientists and it is tricky for them to tell the difference between their own limits and the actual limits of the theories. - to reveal that there is *no* physical intuition at the quantum level - just laws. And we want those laws to be as elegant and simple and true to experiment as possible."

The point of view expressed here is very different than the way those classes were taught.  It helps me to understand the computations I was doing in those classes.  This is a very practical book which explains how to think about problems in quantum mechanics and how to solve them.  This book would also be suitable for the lay person who wants to understand how quantum mechanics is used without having to learn all the equations and do all the calculus."

I think that the book was written directly from lecture notes, and out of the classroom environment the explanations come across as contrived, opaque and endlessly wordy. Frankly, I don't know any more about QED now that before I read it. Sorry to knock the work of a Nobel winner, but that's my take on it."

                "Text": "There is an old expression among monastics: \"We aim not to understand God but to immerse ourselves in the mystery of God.\" This books immerses us in the mystery of quantum physics. While it spares us the advanced math and esoteric details of the experiments and analysis of Feynman's conclusions - it is still technical and can be hard to get through. But it is worth the effort. The strange way light behaves when interacting with matter boggles the mind yet is supported by the evidence. When done reading, I felt simultaneous informed on the fundamental process of reflection and amazed that it can happen at all. Great stuff."
