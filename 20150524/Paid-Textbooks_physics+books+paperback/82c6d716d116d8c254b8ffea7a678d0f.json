It was Sagan's message of faith in science's role as mankind's candle in the dark, as well as his wonder for the universe that infected me, and spurred me to the path I'm on now. If you're not a religious fundamentalist and would like to open your mind to mankind's future in space as well as the wonders that await us in the cosmos, buy this book....or buy it for some teenager you know..."

                "Text": "To the original version of this book I would have certainly given five stars; it is a wonderfully inspiring book, by a man who was not only a fine scientist but a great humanitarian, a man who had worked hard to persuade governments of the danger of 'nuclear winter'. Sagan's astute mind, and his compassion, is brought to bear on his vision of our futures in Pale Blue Dot. This is not a utopian vision, Sagan is certainly cognizant of human frailty and our propensity for violence: \"If we continue to accumulate only power and not wisdom we will surely destroy ourselves.\" It is, however, ultimately a hopeful vision, and one based largely upon what we know of our universe, the physics underpinning its behaviour. His thinking is thus more than merely speculative. When, however, I received my own paperback version...I found that all the photographs, images, and graphs - an important part of the book, still referenced in the index - had been removed from the text, hence the four stars, not five. These images in the original book had helped to elucidate what we had achieved already, our discoveries of strange new worlds, as well as what the author and others believed we might achieve in the future. The removal of this material, for reasons which I can only guess, is to be regretted. Would Carl Sagan have supported such editing of his work? What do you think?"

While the writing is still composed of Sagan's great and wise words, the book is but a shadow of itself without pictures, and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for omitting them.  This is a digital edition folks - it can and should contain multiple forms of media where called for, and there is absolutely no excuse for not reproducing the photography and illustrations from the original work.  Until they release an edition with pictures intact, I must give this a one-star review and steer potential buyers to the actual book, not the Kindle edition."

                "Text": "Mishmash of material lacks the scope and grandeur of Cosmos.  In effect it gives him an opportunity to catch up on about 15 years since Cosmos, but adds little beyond what was conveyed before.  And goes almost nowhere in making a good case for space exploration and a weaker one in support of his SETI project.  It hardly stands well on its own and even Sagan's usual comfortable style seems pale itself rather than stirring.  Not a failure as a book, but certainly not his best, and only for those who either like Sagan or want a survey of those years focussing on Sagan's ideas and contributions, which may not be fully objective or complete.  Get it at the library.  Both Cosmos and Demon-Haunted World are more worth reading."

                "Text": "This book was the third Sagan book I read (the first was Demon-haunted world followed by Cosmos) and certainly, it is a most. Sagan portraits the future of mankind as a hopefully, brilliant one. A future that has been,  and still is, the dream of science fiction writers (and readers like me)  for years. It is hopefully to know that there are scientists who take that  picture seriously and encourage readers to believe that it is possible as  long as we want it to be possible.  But of course, Sagan snaps us in the  back and reminds us the dangers the technologies that might make that dream  come true will pose us if we are foolish enough to misuse them. And makes  us think about the state of humankind and, despite the fact that \"the  Universe wasn't made for us\" -as he put it- to remember how precious,  unique and importat we are. The Universe might be crowded of all kinds of  intelligent life. But certainly, there is only a human race.  This book  made me remember a quote by Isaac Asimov: \"The future of humanity is  in the stars, and that future is to bright to be lost by dumb and ignorant  superstition.\"  Two years and a half after Sagan's death, I still miss  him."

He was the most successful science communicator of the 20th century. Much of his writing is evident in the new \"Cosmos\" TV series, narrated by Neil Degrasse Tyson. And why not? The original \"Cosmos\" was his, and his influence is felt in this new series, as well it should be. \"Pale Blue Dot\" is a sweeping, humbling, description of the Universe, and our \"potential\" future in it. Along the way, he describes our triumphs, our failings, all the ways our species can become extinct. Or survive. The choices leading to either door are ours. We can use our technology either to destroy ourselves, or to ensure the survival of ourselves and our posterity. Sagan believes we can, we must, choose survival, and paints a compelling picture of all the ways humans can create homes on other worlds. All the while, never forgetting our heritage, our history. our humble beginnings."

From a distance of 3.7 billion miles our mighty planet is scarcely more than a tiny blue pixel.  This amazing photograph and Mr. Sagan's accompanying essay are among the most inspirational stories ever shared by our species, and serve perfectly to summarize our place in the universe.  This book builds upon these concepts to illustrate the fragility of the only home humanity has ever known, and explores in dept the possibilities that the human race might one day escape the confines of our planet on a journey to the stars.  Everything that has a beginning has an end, and one day our very sun shall die.  This book reminds us all that a one-planet species, is ultimately doomed to extinction."

The first part of the book was very informative and interesting. The second half or so seemed overly speculative. That may have been the intent but it seemed less organized than the beginning. At any rate, the speculations are certainly interesting to consider as they are important for reasons we see all around us."

It's very humbling. Sagan went before his time, and didn't even get to see the landing of Mars Pathfinder in 1997, but that mission was renamed \"The Sagan Memorial Mars Station.\" Whereas Cosmos talked about the past and future of space travel, this book talks about the future. It's written 20 years after \"Cosmos\" so builds upon what that book says. It used many charts and interesting pictures and graphs. This is better than \"Cosmos\" in my opinion, and is my favorite book ever."

Also interesting is the reactions of people to Sagan's usual  bit on the nature of humanity, some people balk quite violently when faced  with their (and that of their fellows) ignorance, arrogance and cosmic  insignifigance.  I suppose that's only natural, but Sagan also offers an  alternative to our stupidities in rational understanding and wonder at the  universe, even though Sagan himself acknowledges that he is hardly an  unsympathetic and indifferent observer to humanity and is hence sometimes  swaed by our prejudices and failings.  As for the final word on the design  arguement for a cosmic creator, which is brought up in Bale Blue Dot: we  are proudcts of this universe, its logical then that as a survival  mechanism we would see the universe in a way that made sense to us and  stimulated our minds to fruther interact with our enviroment, its how the  human species survived in the past, and things are more complex now, but it  is still how we survive.  In fact Sagan makes that very point somewhere in  this and (more so) in his other books."

Movies such as Contact, Armageddon, Deep Impact, and even  (regrettably) Rocketman, have been shaping public perception of our species  future in space.  I believe Sagan has been responsible for this recent  explosion in the interest of space.  Of course I realize the findings of  the \"supposed\" fossilized Mars life has played a huge part in  this as well.  Sagan is magnificent in his ability to pull the reader in  and open his/her mind to the truly important things in life - truth,  discovery, and skepticism.  This book is a truly a steeping stone in our  pursuit towards the ultimate question - where are we going?  Space the  final frontier."

Not only does  Sagan speculate on the future of our space program but covers the events  that have contributed to our understanding of space and the universe.  The  first three chapters should be mandatory reading for high school students.  Sagan helps us discover our place in the universe and enlightens our senses  with his unrivaled literary style."

In the vastness of space here we are mortal humans traveling on spaceship earth hurtling through its vast darkness.It is a very eye opening experience  finding where we fit and just how full of ourselves we as humans have become. After reading \"Sagan's\" most important passage of us on the \"Pale Blue Dot\" it  is clear that we are just a small paragraph in the multitude of pages in the book of time. For me personally, it opened up many more questions of which currently there are no good answers for my pea sized brain.It brings a clear and concise picture of for some how  Religion and thoughts of a Omnipotent \"God\" came to be.This read throws a wrench into the works about that kind of irrational thinking and forces one to rethink that position. Science and men of science have showed us the path.We need to look to where it leads.And with that we can find ourselves and our place in the \"Cosmos\"."

Robotech, a series of animated movies was also written by Carl Sagan in his future outlook of man's next step into the centuries to come. Overall, I encourage more people to read his work, as it inspires us to think beyond the mundane things around us and think in more objective terms of our reality. While Carl is not with us physically, his work continues on and still enchants."

For example, the number of moons described that orbit Jupiter and Saturn is out of date and a few more other notions, but the majority of the book is still relivant."

I can't say if it's as good as Cosmos or it's better or worse than it, as it depends on your taste, but I myself think at least it can be fairly linked with Cosmos. A must-read to everyone who are interested in the Space age and its short history. And what I want to note is that if you can afford Hardcover, buy that. Not paperback. Although the text itself is not different, to understand the 'vision' and 'pale blue dot', Hardcover will be far better. For me, I bought Paperback first, but at the end I had to brought both of them!"

It covers every planet and its' environment, how the planet's environment came to be, and where it  may be going.  It covers man's exploration of space and time, from  satellites to shuttles.  More on future technological development of  nuclear directioning of comets and asteriods.  I strongly recommend this  book to anyone who is interested in our solar system and beyond.  The name  'Pale Blue Dot' comes from a story told by Dr. Sagan of when the Voyager  was passing Mars.  Sagan recommended NASA to turn the satellite around and  take a picture of Earth from such a great distance.  NASA questioned him  for it would appear to be a pale blue dot and a virtuosly useless picture.  Sagan explained to them that man needs to see Earth from another  perspective, so we might get an idea of exactly how insignificant we are in  such a vast cosmos."

I never understood how he could hold to such a irrational philosphy and yet push critical thinking on everyone (See Demon-haunted  world).  His best contradiction was proclaiming design and complexity in  the universe, yet denying the need for a designer.  He seemed to forget  logic states \"chance\" has no power and that the Big Bang  logically points to the need for a transcendent creator."
