                "Text": "As a college student taking first year physics, I have to say that this book set a high standard of mathematical comprehension. The author offers little examples during his explaintion which leaves the reader lost when trying to apply it on his/her own. The expansion itself can be confusing due to unexplained algebraic manipulations. I found my self avoiding the textbook and found online resources to be much more helpful e.g. Khan Academy. I understand that calculus based physics can be rigorous at times, but even the textbook you learn from, the very tool, shouldn't be confusing. As a computer science college student, this is my point of view."

                "Text": "If you rent it, the description specifically says a rental may not come with an online access number for Mastering Physics, which is why I chose to purchase the book instead of renting it. What they didn't tell you was that if you buy it new IT DOES NOT COME WITH MASTERING PHYSICS. I could have saved myself $65 by just renting it for the semester. The descriptions need to tell you when you're buying a \"brand new book\" that the online access card hasn't been included."
