It's by far the best physics textbook out there, and I used it to supplement my college physics class if I didn't understand a concept from this textbook or lecture."

I purchased this book and paid slightly more to receive a very good condition book and boy was I disappointed, so buyer be aware you might not get what you expected as far as quality."
