                "Text": "I found this book very enjoyable and a good mental reflection toward the Truth from a different angle then I'm used to. The best anyone can do is to reflect, or point, toward the Truth and Tomaj does a good job of it. I'm not convinced about how important we are to the whole show yet, but I'm still seeking. I do know that this isn't the only show in town, \"My Father's (that is Consciousness's) house has many mansions.\"...and that picture wasn't pointed at, but \"Good\" book!"

As already said, the author makes intriguing comparisons (between quantum physics, ancient religious writings, and transcendental phenomenology) that invite you to look into these things further. A fun read!"

I study Ramana Maharishi and Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami and Wu Hsin and this book connects it all so that I can understand it and the concept of maya. An incredible find.  When the student is ready the teachings appear.  Aum Namah Sivaya"
