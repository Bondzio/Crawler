                "Text": "It was a very good physics book. The only reason why it isn't 5 stars is just based on how old the information is and the cost basis on it. I honestly could have done the entire semester without the book and just looked to the internet for the topics, which they had aplenty, albeit not as ordered. But I can't really take it up with the publisher since I think all college book requirements are a scam. Other than that, I learned everything because of this book."
