                "Text": "This is a decent text that covers the physics of waves, predominately mechanical waves. Its no more than a simple introduction and does not offer much insight into interesting phenomena such as anisotropy and periodic composite materials. I don't have an extensive collection of texts of wave propagation in materials but I'm sure there are plenty out there that are better than this one."

If you want to get down to business in a wide-range of wave phenomena and prefer a rigorous, theoretical treatment pick up this Dover book."
