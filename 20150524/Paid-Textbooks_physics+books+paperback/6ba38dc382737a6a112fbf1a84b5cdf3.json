                "Text": "The book provides readers with the view of how particle physicists understand the nature with the help of group theory. Readers have to know the basic idea of particle physics beforehand in order to understand the  contents of the book. If you know it well, you can learn a lot from the  book. One thing I recommend is to solve the problems at the end of each  chapter by yourself. After doing that, you don't have to be afraid of group  theory when studying particle physics."

I gave it two stars because nevertheless I was able to glean some little bits of insight from the book, but unfortunately not much."
