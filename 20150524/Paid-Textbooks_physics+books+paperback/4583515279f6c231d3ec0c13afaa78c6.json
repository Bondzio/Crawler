The equations are easy to follow with the right amount of calculus. I have been TA for few years in introductory physics courses and I would totally recommend to my students."

                "Text": "This book has excellent practice problems, which make you think, but are also very fun and wacky. They are much more interesting than the standard dry physics problems you find in most physics textbooks. They are not only entertaining, but answers and detailed hints are provided for many of the problems."
