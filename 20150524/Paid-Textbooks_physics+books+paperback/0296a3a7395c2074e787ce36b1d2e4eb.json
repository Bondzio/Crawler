It is very accessible to those who are not expert in the subject, entertaining, and inspiring, as any true classic. The lectures are each up to 10 pages long and masterfully organized in ascending difficulty. A joy to read."

It's an excellent addition to my library, and reading his lectures, you can see why Feynman is so respected among physicists."
