                "Text": "This book is a great place to start for anyone wanting to learn the basics of Newtonian physics. I decided to read this book in preparation for my high school's Physics AP class that I'll be taking next year. Comparing this book to an outline of the course, I found that the book covers more topics than the class, but in less detail. Like I said, it's great for the basics, but that's about it. The approach is rather non-mathematical, but very clear and easy to understand. Kuhn has done a great job of making basic physics understandable. This book, in conjunction with a study text, such as Schaum's Beginning Physics I or a textbook, would be an ideal way to learn physics on your own."

Out of all the books I bought, this one is by far his favorite. It explains everything very well and truly works well as a self-teaching guide. Highly recommended if you are looking for a good book as a basic physics refresher or to learn about physics for the first time. It goes over all the areas of general physics, which provides a great overview of the subject."

BUTTTTT I strongly suggest u take a week or two to read through it (a chapter at a time).... before u start ur more intense study using your normal textbook.  This book will give u the basic THEORY behind physics.  This will come in handy once u start using weird formulas and whatnot during your course.  So read it first.  It's an easy read, so don't fear that it might take too long."

It didn't talk much about pendulums and the example problems are pretty limited.  For example I did pretty well in college physics with three simple kinematic equations.  After finishing the book I still needed to find those equations (such as v^2-v0^2 + 2ax) so someone who did have the experience I did wouldn't get as much out of this book. Overall if you're looking for a more theoretical understanding this book will be great.  If you're looking to do some practice problems and learn how to calculate specific variables this is not the book for you."

It moves pretty fast and requires application and study.  It's worth reading Thinking Physics along with this one.  To be fair, basic Physics is a pretty deep subject to encapsulate.  I've already taken these classes, so I'm kind of guessing it to be a real help as a study guide.  It seems much better then the old paper back study guides I had in the seventies.  Certainly worth the price of purchase if you will sit down and do it.  Be sure you have your algebra down."

What it leaves out, that you get in most physics texts, are all the conversions you need to do from miles to meters, hours to seconds, etc.  It's probably good for a review or supplement to a college text but not so great as a first Physics book for a high school kid, tho it does cover a lot of topics they don't really cover in high school physics, like atoms and molecules, solids, liquids and gases, static electricity and electrical currents, electrical induction, electromagnetic waves, etc.  I would have given it fewer stars but my high school student actually likes the book, and that counts for a lot."

I can't understand why a school would only offer honors classes, because baseline skills must be mastered before any student can get to honors.

This format makes the book feel more like a trivia quiz than a book about a serious academic subject. Though the book throws some rudimentary equations at the reader, it doesn't explain them clearly enough. Overall, I felt the whole idea of the book was to rush the reader through the subject matter rather than giving the reader a meaningful knowledge of the fundamentals of physics. This book initially appealed to me because it was cheap, but trust me, you're better off paying the premium for a real textbook."

Anything that keeps him off electronics, is a five-star in my book.  I haven't read it, nor do I have much interest in physics, but I do have interest in my child reading and not constantly fighting about him being on electronics.  Has it replaced the electronics? No, but it is a win anytime I see him jotting in his notebook.  I am not sure if my husband has even opened the cover, since my son has had possessive of it since it was opened on Christmas morning."
