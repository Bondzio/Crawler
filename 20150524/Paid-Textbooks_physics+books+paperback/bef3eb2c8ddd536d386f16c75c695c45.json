                "Text": "After years of searching for a really good book on non-relativistic quantum mechanics, I found it in this book.  The beginning student can easily understand it and it's comprehensiveness will appeal to the more  advanced student.  It's use of the Dirac notation makes for a clean and  concise treatment.  The book is FAR better than most other quantum  mechanics books found in university libraries, in my opinion."

                "Text": "This is by far my favorite quantum mechanics textbook. I would not suggest it as a first exposure to quantum mechanics textbook. For those purposes I would suggest griffiths, he is excellent at progressively lying less to the reader as he/she progresses. This book however, presents that subject material in full form and in great detail. I constantly reference back to this book and the other volume."

Without any doubts, one of the best AND clearest books on QM, with mathematics used wisely."
