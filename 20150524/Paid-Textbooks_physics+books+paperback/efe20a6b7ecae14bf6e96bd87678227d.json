                "Text": "This book is a jewel.  One would be hard pressed to find a more comical and enjoyable book to read - anywhere.  Feynman is the scientist who breaks (or should I say, shatters?) the stereotype of the lab-coat physicist who  wears thick, taped up glasses.  The great Richard P. Feynman is a testament  to how great we as a race can me.  I like to think of him as a cross  between Goethe & Robin Williams (and I do NOT mean that in any sort of  deragatory way).  As a physicist, he was top notch, but as a person he was  something even more.  He had a marvelous sense of humor & enjoyed  playing pranks on people.  His love of life spilled over to all the people  he met during his sojourn on the planet.  I only wish that I had been one  of those lucky few to have met & known him personally.  Perhaps what is  most remarkable about him is that he had friends from all walks of life.  Many were scientists, yes, but many more were \"ordinary\" people  off the street.  That is rather noteworthy given the fact that so many Ivy  league-calibre professors feel that they too \"intellectually  gifted\" to associate with the rest of we mere mortals.  Someone once  said that Edwin Hubble wasn't a humble man, but then again, Hubble didn't  have very much to be humble about.  I would argue that one could say the  latter of Feynman as well, but not the former.  READ THIS BOOK and share  the experiences of one of the most extraordinary and yet fun loving  personages of the 20th century (if not all time).  I guarantee it will make  you laugh like few other books you will ever read."

                "Text": "This is a great book, for both geeks AND non-geeks.  It explores the exciting life of Richard Feynman, one of the greatest physicists of the century.  But this book is not about physics, rather it tells you how interesting of a life a physicist can have.  It has stories of how the author got girls, tricked and joked on friends with his wits, did stupid things at formal occasions, and blabbered about many parts of the government and other recognized systems. I definitely recommend this book to those thinking about a career in research science like I am.  It gave me the impression that being a scientist doesn't necessarily make you stay in a white lab coat all day talking geek-talk.  On the contrary, you can still have a life.  It confirmed my want to pursue and education and career in research chemistry. As for non-geeks, you'll get a good laugh about the interesting character of Feynman, without needing any knowledge of math or science to read the book (though there are about 1 or 2 jokes that somewhat relate to math)."

                "Text": "Recently, during a course in Quantum Mechanics, my professor suggested reading this book and I feel that my life has a new meaning now.  Richard  Feynman was a true genius and anyone remotely interested in the field or  the man must read this book.  Feynman's autobiography brings to light an  amazing man who fixes radios since he was ten, who cracks safes, who can  smell like a dog, does tricks like a conjurer and even picks rooms directly  opposite to the girls' dormitory!!!  One of the most brilliant minds of  twentieth century, the autobiography also portrays him as a human being who  didnt do extraordinary things but ordinary things extraordinarily well.  A  must read for students or even for ordinary people because the book also  shows that human capability is in the will and the mind.  We set boundaries  and limitations to our abilities ourselves not bothering to think that we  are capable of a lot more if we put ourselves to the task.  For a more  scientific approach to his work, you may wish to read the book, 'QED' which  has a series of his lectures at Caltech for the general public and the  famed 'Feynman's Lectures on Physics' his lectures in college physics at  Caltech during 1965-66."

                "Text": "I'm in the camp that believes Feynman was a brilliant scientist but somewhat of a jerk.  His practical jokes, though perhaps brilliantly conceived, were often hurtful and arrogant.  His stories about his bar-hopping and womanizing lack credibility.  I'm not impressed that he knew how to play bongo drums -- who doesn't?  And then there are his \"cultural\" pursuits. I know other scientific types who look down on the arts and believe they are easy.  As a result, we get a lot of scientists who think they can write, compose or play music, do art, write poetry, etc., when, in fact, they are usually embarassingly terrible at those things.  Feynman is guilty of that; his prose is mundane and cliched.  Where was his editor?  On the other hand, I was very impressed by Feynman's passion for correct learning, that is, to make sure you UNDERSTAND something, not just rely on rote.  That's valuable.  Ditto for his belief that if a person does not live up to another person's expectations, it's the fault of the person who set the expectations too high, not the person who failed to meet them. I enjoyed the vignettes of other great thinkers. I appreciated his plea for total intellectual honesty in all endeavors. And although I think Feynman was a wiseacre, I have to admit that he had me laughing in a few places.  I believe Feynman was a great man -- perhaps more accurately, a great nerd.  I'm glad I read the book, but in its entirety, I would have to say it merits only three stars."

                "Text": "I was flipping through TV channels one day, around 4 or 5 years ago, when I came upon a show with this guy playing bongo drums and singing about orange juice! Since I am a drummer, I was curious as to who the person was - he didn't look at all like a drummer. In fact, he looked more like a professor of some kind or another. I was intrigued and I kept watching this guy wailing away at the drums. Well, it of course turned out to be Richard Feynman. It was the first time I ever heard of Richard Feynman, but it was not the last. The TV show (it turned out to be a PBS special) was about Feynman and his quest to visit a place called Tuva something. Anyway, they talked about Feynman and his life in physics and teaching, and I was mesmorized. After watching this show, I purchased a copy of the book \"Surely, Your Joking, Mr. Feynman\" and I have become a Feynman fan ever since. The book is inspirational. Feynman comes across as a \"doer\" who understands the difference between awareness and knowledge, and points out that you can only really ever know anything by doing. My only regret is that I never got to see a live Feynman lecture. However, one can follow his example and continually challenge themselves by separating facts from opinions and assumptions, and by proving the facts themselves (therein lies true knowledge). All in all, an amazing book I would recomend to just about anyone!"

Who would have thought that a brain that he was (mind you he was a Nobel prize winner who worked with some of the greatest minds known to date, was involved in the making of the atomic bomb, lectured in Cornell, etc etc) was as warped as he?!  I mean, this guy went through life playing pranks on people, doing the most weirdest experiments (such as ferrying ants to determine if they left trails and if they had a sense of geometry, and persisted in controlling his dreams to the point where he could navigate himself in full colour), tried to prove a point by peeing while doing a head-stand and hung out six times a week in a topless bar even while still a professor in Caltech! Feynman was a real character to say the least.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and truly don't remember the last time I loved a book this much for its style, its seeminly identifiable everyday-like experiences but with a hilarious Feynman twist to it, and most of all Feynman's life, pranks and adventures. Interestingly, he also tried to explain some (few) physics laws in humourous ways (probably for the scientifically impaired such as myself) and highlights the problem of rote-learning, which most encouragingly, he says is also practiced by MIT students.  Finally, his insight into MIT and Princeton makes some of the best stories in this must-read book.  A very enlightening and inspirational man.  Very very very highly recommended"

                "Text": "I first heard of Richard Feynman when I was taking Physics in high school and my teacher showed us a movie in which he was interviewed.  In fact, the movie had nothing to do with physics, but with Feynman's quest to visit some obscure country (Tuva??) in the South Pacific.  I was struck by the man's wit, not to mention his intelligence.  Both aspects of his personality came out in this entertaining book.  If you have never heard of Feynman or you have and want to learn more about him, I highly recommend this book.  It includes memoirs both of his work in physics and of his travels through America and around the world.  I found his chapters on safe cracking at Los Alamos and on his army physical examination particularly enjoyable.  \"Surely you're joking...\" is not too heavy on the physics aspect of his life, but it provides just enough to satisfy the scientifically curious.  A great read to stimulate the mind and keep you smiling throughout."

I personally had a hard time putting this book down every night. Even though I started reading this for a physics project it turned out to be a very entertaining assignment due to the many diverse topics discussed in the book. The subjects discussed range from physics to biology and even touching on hypnosis in one chapter. The book starts out by telling how he acted growing up and then went on to tell about his college life and eventually went all the way to his adult life. This book is a humorous look at the world of science through the eyes of one of the greatest physicists of all time, Richard P. Feynman. It is a must read for anyone interested in any science related field."

The book describes the life of a brilliant Nobel Prize-winning physicist, and shows him as a completely accessible human being.  He gives a marvelously entertaining account of some of the experiments he conducted while a college undergraduate - all of them completely understandable to a layperson.  But the book continues through his adult life: his attempts to learn Japanese, his experiences as a patron and legal defender of a local strip club, his encounters with military stuffed shirts during WWII, and dozens of other adventures.  If you want to convince yourself or someone else that it's possible to be a brilliant scientist and a real human being simultaneously, then this is the book.  Both as entertainment and as information, it's a smashing success"

He learned from everything around him, from how people act, to cracking safes (which he did to point out security flaws), to learning about the fascinating world of ants. His sense of humor shines through in all his stories, so that makes this book great fun to read as well as a great resource into the mind of an intelligent and thoughtful man.

                "Text": "The subtitle of this work is `Adventures of a Curious Character' - an apt description of Richard Feynman, physicist and Nobel Prize winner.  Although the narrative is not purely chronological, and certain areas of his life are glossed over (his marriages and family life), this is an entertaining and informative glimpse of how Feynman lived his life and more importantly, his thought process.  By his own admission, he thinks in a different way about math and physics, and his `hands-on' practical approach to science is not appreciated by everyone he encounters.  A good example of this is the section on Brazil: although his students there can regurgitate scientific information, they have no clue on its application, or HOW a theory works.  As a teacher myself, I see this every day - students who can memorize, but not analyze.  Other sections of the book deal with his participation on the Manhattan Project, which illustrates the frenzy the US government went through to develop the atomic bomb; Feynman's running theme here is how `fast' everyone worked, despite limited and unfinished laboratories and resources.  Other topics include his safecracking at Los Alamos; his artistic endeavors (the sequel to this book, `What Do YOU Care What Other People Think?' actually includes some of his artwork, which is outstanding); and his varied musical experiences.  To try to encapsulate all the areas covered in this book would be impossible; at times, it's almost a stream of consciousness monologue.  That, however, is what makes the book so entertaining and definitely worth reading."

Feynman is none of these. He is so very much more.  A misfit more apt to find humanity in a stripper than a theologian.  A man who never outgrew the natural curiosity of childhood, coupled with an entirely un-childlike willingness to follow through.  I can only imagine what working with him at Los Alamos might have been like.  The glimpses into his personal life here are few, but telling.  In these pages, we understand why Feynman is considered one of life's remarkable personalities.  He's the nerd we aspire to be...or at least wouldn't mind having dinner with.  But perhaps more important, what is revealed is the heart and the mind of a man whose life is testament to the richness of the human experience...and how easily we can get in its way.  I am forever glad that I met this man in these pages.  It was worth every moment."

Wasn't he the only one of this select group not kowtowing and susceptible to employment retribution [NASA, Ride, et al.]?  Imagine if everyone actually said it as it is?  Feynman, in a bar, says he'll buy a woman drinks (after first  being asked to by her) only if she first agrees to bedding w/him afterwards.  Conditions point blank.  Cold.  No silly games.  Too intelligent and life's too short.  Feynman had great disdain for affectation: a pope's gown, military bars & stars, long titles.  I don't recall the book giving you all of this, but you do get a very refreshing insight into a real person - Dr. Richard P. of Rockaway.  And you know that question: Of all the people ...whom would you like to have a dinner with?  Sorry, D-Cups."

Quite simply it will have you rolling on the floor as the Nobel-laureate tells of his stint playing the frigideira (a sort of inverted metal pot) in  a Brazilian school of Samba, of the time he was declared mentally unfit to  serve in the army because he insisted he could sometimes hear voices in his  head, or the time he serendipitoulsy pointed out a fatal flaw in the design  of an uranium enriching facility even though he couldn't tell whether the  symbols in the blueprints were valves or windows.  Whether the stories he  tells are all true or not, you have to admire Prof. Feynman's sheer  inventiveness and his unmatched talent as a narrator and a humorist.  A  word of caution, however:  a faithful movie adaptation of these memoirs  would not be rated PG."

You may discover many of math equations, science theorems that apply in life. After finish reading this book, you will see your life differently.

The book itself is written as a collection of stories as dictated by Feynman himself, which at first is slightly off-putting. His prose is somewhat terse and clunky. However, once I got past the style, I fell in love with the book. The stories provide a very personal and deep view into Feynman's insatiable curiosity and powerful intellect. My favorite aspect of the book is that his character is incredibly easy to relate to, despite his obvious genius. I finished the book with the sense that I knew Feynman very well, and that he was a down-to-earth guy who just happened to have an endless appetite for knowledge, a penchant for making rational decisions, and a liking for physics."

The book is an insight into his days as a child, at school, at MIT, at Los Alamos research center, at the nuclear research center during world war two, his non-existent social life and how he goes on to learn the tricks and become a social animal.  It's really amazing how one man can play so many roles in one life.  But one also admires that Feynman was absolutely committed to his subject with a no-nonsense attitude."

In an age of mediocrity, complacency, and super-specialization, Feynman shows that the combination of an open mind and willingness to reason through anything from first  principles ultimatedly will win the day.  Following his nose into all kinds  of interesting situations, Feynman proves that the right attitude is what  ultimately counts.  A stern dig at 'Science', with it's lingo, pompeous air  and attempted distancing from the general public.  Feynman is undeniably a  genius, but at the same time totally human.  I find myself partaking in  hero worshiping at the same as thinking we could get on well with each  other over a few beers!"

The writing style is light, easy and extremely comical.  I could not put the book down. But to me, the book was mainly inspirational.  Here is a nobel prize winning physicist who tries nearly everything at least once.  He tried safe cracking, mind reading, learning languages, different technicals for meeting women, and living life fully through experimentation.  I now realize that there is another level that life can be lived.  I recommend this book to everyone I know.  It's entertaining, educational and good fun."

Feynman, who encounters many interesting, and at times, unusual obstacles and adventures throughout the span of his lifetime. Mr. Feynman's crazy antics throughout this book remind me of a more professional Michael Richards (Cosmo Kramer, Seinfeld) but still with humor. The book starts with his life as a child with some short stories, to his college days, up to his assistance to the atomic bomb. This book is an awesome book for people from teenagers on up, and will always draw your attention to the book, wondering what crazy thing Mr. Feynman will do next."

It is just a collection of stories that I am sure he would have told you if you two had a beer together."

                "Text": "The book surprised me as I was not expecting it to be fun. No wonder it became a best-seller. This is a quick glimpse at some of Feynman's psychological sub-atomic \"particles\". He is brilliant, vane, profound, trivial, conceited, magnanimous, practical and idealistic. I made so much resonance with Feynman that I searched for some of his videos and then went on to read a bio on Gell-Mann to contrast the characters. Who says a genius or a Nobel laureate has to be pedantic, neurotic and isolated, this guy is fun!  And  yet, his views  are most profound. Truly a character where reduction is out of the question."

Some of the adventures he gets himself in to couldn't be scripted more hilariously if they solely existed in the imagination of a creative character.  Fortunately for us Mr Feynman was determined to live his real life as if it was a brilliant fiction, to dabble in nude painting, to join an award-winning samba band, to pursue amateur experiments on ants and to successfully pick every single lock holding secrets to the Manhattan project FOR A LAUGH!!!  Lucky for us, we get to live vicariously through this brilliant and thrillseeking man.  In one section he reveals part of his technique for getting in to adventures explicitly.  On his annual summer vacation to drive as far as he can towards the Pacific (never making it there) he lands himself in Vegas.  He describes his penchant for being patient spending days in a nightclub in order to rub shoulders with bigwigs like Nick the Greek and get involved in some true adventures.  Mr Feynman is a man who has little time for the social niceties and hypocritical behavior present in our society and he holds an uncompromising scientific outlook.  Not content to let things he disagrees with slide, he is quick to point out the errors in peoples thinking whether it be an artist friend or a very well respected physicist like Niels Bohr.  I absolutely, thoroughly enjoyed this book and I would highly recommend it."

Zweig must have, like myself,  thought the book was so funny that in order to justify his  recommendation to the Wall Street Journal readership, he made a tenuous connection:  \"three qualities an investor needs above all others are independence, skepticism and emotional self-control.\"  Well, I saw no business connection whatsoever in the book but am extremely grateful for the recommendation.  It's the funniest book I have ever read. I disturbed people in the other room with my guffawing the entire three days I was reading it.  I couldn't help myself.  Really funny and really intelligent. It would be difficult to give examples because the stories individually are pages long and together heighten each other's effect. Think of it this way: here's a  physicist who won the Nobel prize,  who in his 20s was invited to work at Los Alamos on the Bomb, discovered whatever he discovered in physics etc. etc. and he's caring, quirky and hyper-inquisitive.  And what he is interested to write about here is not how important he is (he seems unaffected about that) but rather the strange ways of people.  Hilarious. I highly recommend it."

It is always difficult for a scientist to explain and express her/his passion for physics or mathematics to someone who has no scientific background. It is rather like a music lover trying to explain the genius of Mozart to the deaf. But that's exactly what Feynman does in this book, by intertwining the scientific and the not-so-scientific aspects of his life. Anyone, scientist or not, is sure to enjoy the humour and adventure in this collection of stories.  But underlying these honest and often hysterical anecdotes are some fundamental truths about science and education, which apply to many aspects of our lives.  Time and again, Feynman has you nodding your head and doubling over with laughter as he insists on pointing out the obvious, refuses to play along with absurd social norms, and just keeps on doing it his own way.  (If you enjoyed this book, you are sure to enjoy Feynman's \"What Do YOU Care What Other People Think?\""

My father gave me his copy to read when I was in eighth grade and I was immediately fascinated with not just physics, but the fun that could be had by looking at the world in a curious way.  Every story captured my attention and they were all told in a way that makes one idolize Feynman, not see him as annoying or self-important, the way some intellectuals come across.  While some of the content is not exactly appropriate for a 12 year old, there's much worse stuff on TV.  I highly recommend that anybody with intellectually curious young relatives give this book to them as a present.  Creating a love of learning, especially around Science, Technology, Engineering and Math is extremely important in the modern world.  It personally led me on a hunt for knowledge through the land of physics, followed by computer science, followed by finance, followed by biotechnology.  The book of course is also great for an adult for all the same reasons, but I can't vouch for it changing your life."

                "Text": "\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\" was a very funny, informative, and it seemed like you where actually there with him when he talked about his personal experiences.  I learned quite about physics I would have never thought have related to, and that the military needed physicists to actually operate at a high achieving level.  The first chapter was even worth reading about how he made a living from just fixing radios when he was around 10.  Mr. Feynman was a very honest man, even if the truth hurt.  With that, probably thanks to him many things are better for what he did such as the locks and tumblers or the research he had done with the Challenger disaster.  I think this book everyone should read, it is a very inspiring book to learn more about the earth.  It is an all around book, it has its funny moments its serious moments and above all Mr. Feynman when he talked it seemed like he was teaching you."

Not being much for the physical sciences, I still have only a basic understanding of what Feynman accomplished in the world of physics. I only knew of it because it sat on my roommate's bookshelf and he insisted it was a good read, even for a person not as interested in physics as my roommate was. So I gave it a shot. This book really revolutionized my own thinking. Here was a man who, as the almost-as-mandatory follow-up book's title suggests, doesn't care what other people think. He saw the value of life, knew what he wanted to get out of his, and did so, all while having lots of fun and simultaneously becoming (apparently) one of the most heralded physicists of our time. This is a unique book because it is an autobiographical volume about a fascinating man who happened to be a physicist. Read it."

This book is one of my new favorites even though the only reason I read it was for a physics project. I am happy to know that there are other books by Mr. Feynman such as \"What do YOU care what other people think?\". I have actually already purchased this book and cant wait to begin reading it. I enjoyed this book because not only is it science, but it is also fun science! I have never been a great admirer of the science world, but Mr. Feynman's book helped me change my entire outlook."

Actually, this book is less about physics and more about the life of Nobel Prize Laureate, Richard Feynman.  (Richard just rolled over in his grave; if you want to know why -- read this book!)  Once I adjusted  my expectations from education to entertainment, I absorbed every word.  He was always interesting, at times very entertaining and despite his obvious genius he had an utter lack of pretentiousness and conceit that I previously assumed afflicted all venerated scientists.  I left this book wishing for more, and feeling inspired to pursue my own adventures in curiosity.  What could I achieve if, like Richard, I abandoned my Western culture imperative of accomplishment through suffering and played with my talents in ways I felt was fun?"

Feynman had such a rich life that there's something in his adventures for everyone, whether you're a scientist, historian, musician, artist, or linguist.

Feynman was a blue collar character who became a great physicist and a wonderful raconteur and devilish prankster! He never forgot his humble beginnings and was as at home with waiters as he was with Noble Lauretes. This isn't a book about science, it is a book about Feyman's puckish sense of humor, which could be a tad harsh at times, but this reflected his humble roots...this wasn't an intellectual ironic Lampoonish sense of humor, but a \"Gotcha\" trap sprung on the unsuspecting.

His intense curiosity leads him to explore to the point of mastery pursuits, far from the realm of physics, that would be daunting to any of us normal mortals.  It is not a heavy read, I finished it in a few days, but that was also because I found it hard to put down.  You may want to pass it along to a friend rather than keep it as a permanent part of your library but you certainly want to read it if you have any interest at all in Dick Feynman and his life."

Yes, I had to read it for a Physics assignment, and yes, I chose it because it was one of the few interesting-looking ones, but I had a good time reading it in spite of it all. Feynman's series of vignettes about his life experiences were extremely amusing and the quick change of pace from story to story made this book a real page turner. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone needing a good read, a funny biography, or a physics assignment."

The book covers some of the most serious subjects of the 20th century, with humor that will amaze you.  In narrating his adventures, Feynman shows physicists to be human beings, with faults and foibles, and presents reasons why they pursue such esoteric careers.  Anyone who is aware of the history of the development of the atomic bomb, and the U.S Space Program, will both enjoy and learn from this book.  Once you read it, you will be recommending it to all your friends."

There were certainly a few paragraphs that were WAY over my head, but when I started I was afraid I wouldn't understand any of it.  Very, very little of it is written for physicists only -- maybe a total of a page or two.  The rest is simply some life stories by a guy who lived an absolutely fascinating life, from his boyhood (when he repaired everyone's radios) to his Nobel prize.  It never once got boring, and completely held my interest from beginning to end.  If you like true stories and remembrances from amazing characters, you'll like this book."

From his very early childhood it was clear that his fascination with how all things worked and his ability to understand propelled him to greatness in many fields. I recommend this book to everyone I know who has an appreciation for the standouts in Western society along with a sense of humor; he was certainly a character.

It shows that there is no value in pretending to be an expert or in holding a high position in your field of endeavor without just having fun learning and experiencing life.  While Feynman was truely a great mathmatician and physicist and co-developer of the atomic bomb during WWII, this book shows some of his more human reactions and vulnerabilities we all share."

I liked when Feynman asks for a map of a cat  (he really wanted a zoological chart of a cat).  I thought the book was really funny and  enjoyed how no parts of the book are really sad. Feynman acts like a child testing how much he can get away with."

It won't take much to absorb his rather unique style of speaking into your consciousness and this will greatly enhance this first person account of his life experiences. Besides making a significant contribution to the Manhattan Project at Los Alomos, and receiving a Nobel Prize, Feynman (pronounced fine-men) constantly developed many varied interests and pursued them passionately.  If asked to give a one word description of the guy, I guess I would use that word - passionate.  There are many interesting passages in the book, and one of the things I really admired about him was his broad view of education, particularly during his graduate studies.  While at Princeton, he met a number of students and professors in departments other than his physics major, and sat in on many of their courses just because he found the subject interesting.  And because he was a brilliant guy, he caught on quickly to basic issues and often made his unique contributions in those fields as well.  And it was interesting times - he was a student in the 30's, at Los Alamos during WWll and taught for years afterwards (and played the drums, and marched at Rio's Carnival, etc.) He mentions his wives briefly but says next to nothing about his kids.  And he had a fondness for women and met a number at clubs and bars.  Not my expectations of a physicist, but an incredibly interesting guy.  What he was not, was a great writer.  When he described problems and solutions, he raced over the details much like his mind thought.  It was impossible to get a clear grasp of what he was trying to communicate in many of these passages.  But then he always preferred speaking to audiences with a depth of knowledge in the field and was frustrated with those that couldn't keep pace.  A great guy but I wouldn't want him for a professor in one of my EE classes.  Four stars is probably a generous rating, but if you only get through a portion of this book you will be glad that you got to experience and know a little bit about Feynman."

                "Text": "I loved this book. You really get the sense of Richard Feynman's character from this memoir. He was incredibly smart but also insatiably curious. He was interested in everything and was the archetypal \"life-hacker\". Some other reviewers consider this book to be an example of Feynman's arrogance and self-importance. I couldn't disagree more. He comes across as playfully curious about everything and (of course) good at many things but he is as surprised as anyone at how good he can be at something with a little effort. Going to another country? Learn the language. Want to open a safe? Learn how they work. Like pictures? Learn how to draw. We need more Feynmans in the world."

In this book he talks very in-depthly about his life everything from his very early childhood years to his adult life as a professor. The book is very well written with just enough detail to make you interested in all of his adventures, but not too much that you would loose interest. This book does not use complex equations or terms to explain physics terms, but creatively words each concept so that any level of reader and physics explorer could understand what he was doing. Giving this book great word choice and a nice flow that keeps you wanting to read along. Through all of this, the book is comically written and tells about Mr. Feynman's crazy experiments and pranks he played on people. Everything from hiding a door from a member of his fraternity to casually moving around the information for the atomic bomb from safe to safe. Mr. Feynman thrives on crazy adventures through the physics world and does many crazy things along the way to satisfy his hunger for comedy. This book is recommended for anyone who enjoys a good educational book, but also has a good sense of humor and enjoys practical jokes themselves."

The sexism in some of the stories was amusing. Reading his stories about women is like listening to a radio show from the 50's. He was a male living the dream in the 40's and 50's, and some stories you're just waiting for him to start talking about \"dames\"."

I can honestly say I stopped about 2/3s of the way through.  I may go back and finish.  Most of the book (so far) was devoted to his pranks.  A good portion devoted to his ability to break into combination safes.  Might be a great book for a potential safecracker."

I just  can't figure out how so many people give this book a 5 star rating?  to  many chapters are just boring musing from Feynman about some speech he gave at some university or how he played the bongo for awhile.  for a nobel prize winning physicist  who worked on the manhatten project with greats like Oppenheimer and Neils Bohr,  I thought he would have something more interesting to say.  but his memory from working on the project is mostly of picking locks, and aggravating the security by childishly coding his letters to his wife just to see if he can sneek a coded letter by them.  one low point comes when he recalls a conversation with bohr by saying Bohr asked about an idea he had  blah  blah blah !  and then I said blah blah blah.  I'm  sorry , but I don't think you can blah blah blah  a great physicist like Bohr without leaving the reader with the feeling that a great moment was just missed.  haven't read any other books by Feynman and for me one was enough."

                "Text": "Although Mr. Feynman is undoubtedly a smart man, with many things to credit to his name, this book seemed like nothing but his attempt to show how smart he was and is.  However he comes off as extremely arrogant and pompous, the problem being that his anecdotes are ruined by his comments on how stupid others are compared to himself.  Almost every other paragraph is a story in which he felt he outsmarted someone, but in reality, his accomplishments seem very exaggerated and insignificant.  The way he talks about not being considered a sissy by struggling against his frat brothers, outsmarted the waitress with dumb puzzles, and outwitted his frat when stealing a door are NOT impressive in the least, and I feel that a average person could accomplish the same things.  The fact that he writes about it in a manner so that he tries to make himself some child genius is what ruins the book and makes him seem stupider rather than smarter.  I'm sorry Mr. Feynman, you may be a great physicist, but you must be joking if you think you're a writer, and a clever one at that.  I may not be able to solve physics problems like you, but I can assure you...I am much more clever if compared to your life stories (and that's not saying much)."

Oh, I could probably have given you the fact that he was a physicist, and maybe that he had won the Nobel prize, and just recently Jill told me about a Feynman anecdote that she had read by Stephen Jay Gould. After Surely You're Joking, I know much more about Feynman, and why he interests people. As far from the stereotype of the scientist that you can get, yet still having some geeky characteristics that he wasn't afraid to admit to, Surely You're Joking is a portrait of the man in his own words. In fact, the best way to approach this book is as if you had stumbled on to it in a dimly-lit bar, sat down next to it, exchanging turns buying drinks and talking about each other. Just like a conversation, some things are funny, some things don't make sense, and--as a one-sided conversation--they all revolve around a singe subject."

And his appraisal of Feynman's practical jokes being hurtful must be based on something other than this book.  Feynman has some funny stories and provides us with some biographical data along the way to give the stories a setting.  We hear about his childhood and his first job, along with his early fascination with gadgets and inventions.  Not much in the way of specific details on his work in physics, as has been provided in other biographies, and the \"Feynman diagrams, which show the arrows of light and time, are mentioned not-a-once, nor is it detailed exactly what he won the nobel prize for, though his headaches of receiving the prize are amuzing.  Don't look for physics, but for the social life of a physicist who also happened to be a character.  He does talk about physics and math and education in a general way and offers up some general observations about how people approach these subjects. There are stories from Los Alamos to Brazil and Japan and from CalTech and Princeton.  A fun short read, if that's what you're looking for."

The writing is rather pedestrian, but  the author does not purport to create great literature, only to amuse. Some  of these anecdotes can be described as funny, but in many of the stories  Feynman shows a glaring lack of empathy with his fellow man, and seems to  be completely unaware of his shortcoming in this respect. Feynman was among  other things involved in the Manhattan project, and if this is what passed  for humor among the people who created the bomb, their moral stance (or  lack thereof) becomes more tangible. It is a very chilling realization."

                "Text": "Einstein gets all the glory but Feynman in my opinion was way better, much better scientist. Reading his Misadventures was a real treat. I like to think of myself as a Feynman in training but I have to admit that I'm nowhere near as good, yet! Right now the only thing I got going is my sense of humor which just like Feynman's is a bit warped however he was a master of math and all the sciences (except Biology which isn't really a science) Don't get me wrong biochemistry yes, Biology no. Unless I'm dating a really sexy biology mayor then biology really is a science /\\_/\\ (If you know what I'm saying). To all you ordinary Hate science people out there this book doesn't try and explain anything. Sure he talks about it a little but the bulk is just his crazy life and his crazy interaction with people. There is only six words to say, \"You can't make this S*** UP!\""

                "Text": "Our monthly women's book group decided to read this book for February, 2001.  While I thought the mini stories were entertaining they were at times difficult to follow. Feynman would be in the middle of telling one story, totally switch to an unrelated story, and then tell the ending of the first. The book would have appealed to me more if the writer had used a time line, and keep his thoughts in the order that they happened. Feynman's writing style left something to be desired."

While it is indisputable that the man was a physics genius and that he was a phenominal help during the Manhattan project, I grew tired of his incessant contempt for anything or anyone that he didn't approve of. Much of the book is spent with him trying to outmatch and outwhit those in fields that he considers inferior to physics, such as pure mathematics and philosophy. It grows tiresome reading this after a while and the book left me with no better understanding of this distinguished scholar."
