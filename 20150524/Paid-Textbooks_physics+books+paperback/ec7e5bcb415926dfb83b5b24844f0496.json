We are not using it in class but my professor suggested we could work for practice. It may be useful as a fire starter."

                "Text": "This book is an amazing resource for any introductory physics course.  It should be treated like a 'workbook' - student work, ideas, and approaches should be discussed along the way - ideally in an active learning classroom environment.  When used this way it has tremendous strength in helping students build the tools and skills they need to tackle even advanced introductory problems from fundamental principles with strong conceptual understanding.  For any teacher, even culling a handful of activities to supplement your current materials will already be very useful - that is how I make use of it even in a large lecture classroom."
