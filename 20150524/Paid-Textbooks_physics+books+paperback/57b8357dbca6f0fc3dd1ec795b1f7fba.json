                "Text": "This is indeed an excellent book. Witty and insightful, but sometimes the ease, with which you're lead through it, is in the way of stressing the really important stuff. If you are learning diagrams for the first time, and intend to do some serious research using the technique, I believe this book is just not enough: it will leave you unprepared to do much beyond the problems in the book. You might want to consult a more rigorous book, like that of Abrikosov et al., but the style may be a bit of a shock to those not used to the Russian \"condensed writing\". As an introduction that is less painful, and more of a textbook, I suggest Fetter and Walecka's book, though it's out of print."

I read it several years after my  studies, and it represented to me a good and amusing opportunity to refresh  or to learn subjects I didn't remember any more or I didn't meet in  university course.  And taking into account its low price, it is really  worth purchasing this book."

                "Text": "I've browsed through the customary suggested textbooks on many body physics (Abrikosov et al.,Fetter et al., Negele et al., etc) and they are written with a pedagogical intention. However, the student they had in mind was the guy who was always really good in derivations anyway. The beauty of Mattuck's book is that it reminds you where an equation has been first learned. It therefore almost reads like those old gamebooks of yesteryear, where you're constantly looking back through pages. But the flow of argument is definitely there. I'd dare say it does to many body physics what Griffith's has done to Quantum Mechanics. Good starting point before you graduate to the big boys mentioned above."
