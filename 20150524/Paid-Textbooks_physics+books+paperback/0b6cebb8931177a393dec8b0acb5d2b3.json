                "Text": "What makes this Stephen Hawkin book different is that it collects together in one place the original papers of the great masters, starting with Copernicus, and ending with Einstein. A generation ago, Eric Temple Bell suggested that we begin with the classics when learning math and science. Traditionally, it was thought that modern books based on the classics offered more effective ways of introducing or presenting the material, and as a result only a few students (and teachers) took the trouble of looking at the original classics, the central papers of the great masters. The true landmark papers. All the while, they collected dust on the shelves in the back rooms of libraries. Of the giants in science, five stand out, Copernicus, Galilei, Kepler, Newton, and Einstein. A chapter is reserved to each of the five. Each chapter begins with a lively biography which also serves to place the material in the context of the history of science. This is followed with the original papers themselves in translation. With this book, readers can compare Newton's laws from Principia with the fundamental papers of Einstein. It is collected in one place with commentary. Complaint: The print reproduction of Einstein's papers is not good, and some formulas unfortunately have been truncated in the reproduction. Hopefully that will be fixed in a second edition."

The book is a compliation of all the greatest works of physics and astronomy, as we see it today.  The book gives an overview of each scientist life and how they came to their theories.  When the book begins to explore their works it could become daunting for some, but enjoyable at the same time.  A must read for anyone who enjoys deep intellectual thought."

I have always wanted to see a history of physics course or a great books of physics course and this would be the best single volume text.  I highly reccomend this for anyone interested in the history of science and the actual thoughts of the great physicists.  These are not easy reading, but to see into the minds of these geniuses is enlightening.  Covers scientists from Copernicus to Einstein.  Truly amazing accomplishments collected into one volume.  A great buy!"

This great volume, compiled and edited by Mr. Hawking, includes translations of the best work of men like Newton, Galileo and Kepler.  Without these essential revolutionaries we would not have the world as we know it.  This book brings them to life and you will enjoy the commentary as well as the translated works.  A great addition to any bookshelf!"
