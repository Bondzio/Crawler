Anyway I bought this book to prepare myself for exams and engineering certifications that require you to know Modern Physics and related concepts. BIG HELP!"

                "Text": "This writer knows more than just physics, he can write and takes patient time in explaining the details you need to understand physics.  I am still working on his \"Beginning Physics I \" version of the text,  he does not use calculus expressions but sets up the explanation of line integrals so that the central concept is included in the student's mind. The student of calculus can connect the dots, making a summation expression into an integral expression."
