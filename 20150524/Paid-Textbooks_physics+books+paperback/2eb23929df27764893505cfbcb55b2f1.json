                "Text": "This book is excellent for high school students and technical college physics students that are just getting their feet wet in physics mainly via applications and labs. It has more low-level details and tutorial than you would normally expect, and spends some time in elementary math. This is ABSOLUTELY NOT a book for college students taking the two semester sequence in engineering physics usually taken at the college freshman level. Those students need to buy the Schaum's Outline of College Physics, now in its 10th edition, ISBN 0071448144. I would normally give this outline five stars, but I feel that the front cover may be somewhat misleading and cause engineering students to believe that this book will help them through freshman college physics. For that reason only do I subtract a single star from its rating."
