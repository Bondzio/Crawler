                "Text": "In 1982 an experiment that may have profound implications for scientific thought was carried out in Orsay, France, by the physicist Alain Aspect. 'Anybody who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it' proclaimed Niels Bohr. Ghost is the clearest writing I have seen on this difficult subject. Guiding the reader through the thoughts of Bohr, Einstein, Schr\u00f6dinger, and Heisenberg, it sharpens the mind, and prepares one for an understanding of Aspect's ground-breaking work. Ghost is based on interviews with leading quantum physicists. It begins with the need for quantum behaviour to explain black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect. This is contrasted with electromagnetic theory, supported by Young's interference patterns. However, only Bohr and de Broglie could determine how electrons orbit the nucleus - as standing waves - thus explaining atomic structures and spectra. When Schr\u00f6dinger and Heisenberg described the behaviour of subatomic particles, Quantum Mechanics was born. So why fuss over a theory that has given us transistors and lasers? Photons, should they pass one-at-a-time through Young's slits, know whether there's one slit or two, and build an interference pattern (or not) accordingly. So does the electron somehow manage to pass through both slits simultaneously? Try measuring this, and we're led to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Einstein never accepted the intrinsic nature of uncertainty, believing in a hidden but measurable mechanism operating at the subatomic scale, below light speed. An experiment was needed that could display Bohr's ghostly, co-operation-at-a-distance (i.e. faster-than-light 'signals') between photons. Fifty years later, Aspect's experiment conclusively illustrated this. Today's physicists concur that the philosophical implications are staggering, and this book admirably opens the subject to a wider audience."

                "Text": "This book is a collection of interviews with various quantum physicists and it discusses the different theories that are being promoted in this century in regard to quantum mechanics.  While it appears to me that  the interviewer is biased in his own ideas regarding which quantum theory  is the right one,  (or the one he prefers)  there is a  sufficient variety  of physicists to insure that several different viewpoints are expressed.  Under this format you are then allowed to make up your own mind in regard  to how you think quantum physics works.  While the book makes no  attempt to say it has all the answers, it does let you know what directions  they are looking in.  Without going into too much detail,  I very much  prefer the direction that John Bell was going in, on pages 48, & 49.  This book is a very good read for those who are curious about quantum  physics but don't want to have anyone try and sell them on only one idea or  theory.  I liked this format a lot."

After giving us an understandable summary of what we know and don't know about the sub-atomic world (this is an achievement in and of itself), Davies interviews several physicists from around the world who explain to us their views of Quantum Theory.  If you have ever had an interest in the mysteries of elementary particles, \"The Ghost in the Atom\" is a must for you"

                "Text": "This book is really an excellent display of the conceptual confusions of Physicists who are trapped in the ex-Positivist Concept of Meaning. It looks only Niels Bohr looks like almost let himself free from that trap. I say ex-Positivist Concept of Meaning because Positivists had already gave up from that concept of theirs towards the end of 20th Century. It is really picturesque to see some of the Physicists saying \"this concept of meaning is so important maybe it shouldn't be left to the Philosophers to sort it out\" while they are unaware that they are already trapped in their concept of meaning. What I think is Physicists should rather than pushing the Philosophers away from their conceptual problems, they should welcome them into the bottle that they are trapped in."

When asked questions about how quantum physics relates to certain things in life they make total fools of themselves.  I thought quantum physicists were the pound for pound strongest of scientists but what a bunch of geeks.  Only a couple of the scientists interviewed gave intelligent answers.  A must if you have a strong background in quantum physics.  I advise you not to buy this book is you are just starting to learn about quantum physics, it will confuse you, and these geeks will make you think quantum physics is a bull poop science."
