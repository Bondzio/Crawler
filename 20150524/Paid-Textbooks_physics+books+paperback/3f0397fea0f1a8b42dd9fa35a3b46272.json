As a high school physics teacher, I find this book valuable as a resource for teaching my honors or Pre-AP level physics classes, and for challenging bright students who are interested in learning more about physics, such as students who are interested in going into science, medicine, or engineering.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about physics."
