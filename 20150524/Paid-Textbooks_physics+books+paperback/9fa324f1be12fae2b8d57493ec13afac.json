                "Text": "This is an incredibly stimulating book by a leading physicist reflecting on the current status of fundamental physics. It is not just about science per se, but also the sociology and even the philosophy of science, seen from the point of view of a practicing physicist who has worked with string theory and who now thinks that it likely is a dead end in terms of \"the ultimate theory of everything.\" Smolin gives a fascinating overview of the recent history of physics, arriving at the conclusion that this is the first generation of physicists in about a couple of centuries who have not managed to produce a major theoretical breakthrough. String theory for Smolin is a brilliant idea that had the unfortunate consequence of taking over the entire field, which resulted in hiring and granting policies that have systematically discouraged other approaches (such as loop quantum gravity, on which Smolin also has worked). The author diagnoses the problem in terms of both philosophy and sociology of science. Philosophically, the current dominant figures of fundamental physics see science itself very differently from the physicists of the generation of Einstein, and this change of vision is not necessarily for the better. Sociologically, we are treated to an in-depth criticism of how granting agencies and departmental hiring practices work, something that will not surprise anyone who has actually been in academia, but that is good to appreciate on the part of the general public. Smolin ends up making some bold suggestions on both how to improve the culture of science and how to get physics unstuck from its current predicament. Even if you are sympathetic to string theory, this is a book well worth reading in order to gain a better perspective on how we do physical science today (despite the fact that the middle part gets quite technical and may not be easy to digest for everyone)."

                "Text": "This is a reasonably engaging book presenting a perspective on theoretical physics that has been rather under-represented in popular works. If you've read popular books advocating string theory and found them convincing, this book will give you a more balanced understanding of the theory's achievements and its limitations. Smolin argues that string theory is failing because it's an extension of the practical particle physics that has led to successes such as the Standard Model--an approach that has done so well, he says, that it's drowned out other avenues of research right at the moment when it has ground to a halt itself--and that what is needed now is more emphasis on re-examination of fundamental problems like spacetime and quantum mechanics. My views are almost opposite in a way (i.e. that the problem with string theory is that it isn't nearly practical enough), but Smolin is an expert whose opinion is worth reading. One point of irritation for me in the text is that I don't trust the analogies. Although I don't know the technical details of most of what he discussed, an analogy he made for something I do understand (fine tuning and the Higgs mechanism) appears to have nothing to do with the actual physics. The others could be better, but I can't tell. His discussion of the specifics of string theory is more balanced than in other books I've read, and that's what makes the book most useful in my view. The rest of his views are kind of out there, but interesting."

Smolin gives lucid explanations for sometimes esoteric concepts in physics that a non-specialist can easily follow if he or she has at least university-level physics.  This book is not a diatribe against string theory. In fact, Smolin often goes out of his way to give string theory the benefit of the doubt that it may be right after all. One of his main concerns is that after 20+ years, string theory remains far from being verified by experiment and this is a serious problem.  This state of affairs should be of concern to physicists whether they are string theorists or not, and the general public as well because they are the ones who ultimately fund research programs through taxes."

                "Text": "The Trouble with Physics is like four small, lucid and intertwined books in one - The first one is about the sociology of the theoretical physics academic community.  The second describes in what sense string theory has failed.  The third is about the five great problems in theoretical physics today. The fourth is about the current experimental results that need explaining.  I have listed the four books in increasing order of interest to me.  I was reading the fourth book on a plane trip and discovered that I was mumbling to myself \"Oh my god, Oh my god\", laughing out loud (from a sort of nervousness I guess) and constantly having to remind myself to breath.  Instead of trying to convey that science is pretty much on top of things Smolin conveys the utter confusion and excitement that these results warrant.  This is not the stuff that firm calm is made of but rather fire that heats and burns.  What Smolin has done is to describe the theoretical context that exists (that's in book three) and how the experimental results don't fit.  I have a physics degree from 36 years ago, have recently studied Quantum Field Theory and string theory and yet I have just understood the magnitude of the issues raised.  Other books and popular descriptions seem pretty banal in comparison.  In the spirit of balance, I probably should say that I may be a little prejudiced towards Smolin as it was his Three Roads to Quantum Gravity that got me studying QFT six years ago.  Why?  Because after reading Three Roads, I remember thinking that I wanted to be able to follow these developments mathematically and not just from the popular descriptions.  Incredibly, Smolin's book, totally without math, conveys the substance and depth of the issues in an unprecedented fashion."

He makes a strong case about the failure of physics to come up with a new paradigm.  And his suggestion that social forces or prejudices limit progress of creative individuals brings our discipline into the human arena along with any other professions that suffer similar restrictions by entrenched human attitudes.  Carefully written, thought-provoking, sometimes repetitive."

As an insider (he is a distinguished theoretical physicist active for many years in string theory, among other things), he gives a lively description of a strange state of affairs, where a particular approach to particle physics, though still incomplete and not supported by experimental confirmations, has come to be described as THE ultimate theory of everything; and how this made nearly impossible for a young physicist to build a career on different, even promising, approaches, which for this reason have been abandoned (should we say ignored?) in the last 30 years. However, you will not find here the ideas of a polemic writer, or a string-hater! You just will find a honest discussion by someone who loves science, and respects it. Many open answers for insiders, and a wonderful fresco for the cultivated outsider. Higly recommended to the strings community."

                "Text": "Before reading this book I heard many positive reviews from my friends, and having finished it I'm not disappointed. Not only does it give a very interesting history of the ideas of unification in physics (I did my project work in the UK on the original Kaluza Klein Theory), but also gives a glimpse of the community doing the science. Belief in what you do is necessary to do a good job, but belief can also backfire and become blind. This is most likely what has happened to String theory, that has had unfortunate repercussions for alternative theroies such as loop quantum gravity, twistors, and other visionary ideas. On top of this, Smolin also rightly critizises Universities to encourage \"standard\" Science and discourage visionaries from positions and jobs. This is a much more serious development and is (among other things) an effect of Big Science as Just Any Job, subject to tests, evaluations, peers, making a career for tenure, etc. I see this in my own country where scientists with original ideas have a hard time surviving in a bureaucratic tangle of committies, evaluations, politically correct research grant applications and heavy teaching burdens. I think the most interesting research these days come from hightech companies, and independent research insititutes like the Perimeter Institute and Santa Fe Institute for non-linear science, to mention a few. If I was financially independent with more brains than I actually have, I would open an institute like that. The research topic? Building artificial minds and trying to understand human and animal intelligence and cognition. And having a lot of fun at work without red tape getting in your way, which is what science and exploring the world is really about."

                "Text": "Smolin really delivers with this volume. It's pretty weighty, but the concepts are presented very neatly and without a lot of the technical jargon. The real strength of this book is Smolin's real objectivity when surveying the landscape of modern physics research. With all the hype over String Theory, it's nice to see someone take a step back from the giddying beauty and symmetries of the theory(ies) and provide a realistic assessment as to whether or not the theory has delivered. I think some of the best parts of this book are the last few chapters that deal with the sociological and philosophical aspects of science in general for the 21st century. Smolin's insights into the profession, particularly his critique for how new graduates are hired, given tenure, or research grants are pointed and disconcerting. Whether or not String Theory is the real deal, or the worst fad in physics since the aether, Smolin's approach to the subject is one that is well wroth embracing. The lesson that professionals and amateurs alike can take from this is never to put all your eggs in one basket. There've just been too many precedents of fundamental assumptions being overthrown in the past 300 years."

Smolin urges for a deeply revised approach to science, for the sake of the best tradition of physics. It's a courageous stance, now necessary and useful irrespective of whether or not you share Smolin's ideas and suggestions."

Those reviewers claim that as a result of the way Smolin \"bashes\" string theory, he loses credence.  It seems that for similar reasons, one could argue Smolin's negative reviewers lose credence."

This book has opened up the world of modern physics for me. It is a report from and about modern physics from a person who has been there and done that. It is a summary contrasting and comparing approaches such as string theory, QED, quantum gravity, cosmology, and related topics from a scientist who is active in several of these fields, and writes with grace, clarity, and imagination about the strengths and weaknesses of current theoretical approaches. He starts by identifying five major unsolved problems in modern physics, and uses these problems to rate modern theories for efficacy, He points out some novel and thought provoking new experimental data, and suggests where they might lead. He is careful to distinguish background dependent from background independent approaches, and allows for the possibility that general relativity needs to be amended. Without a single mathematical formula, he conveys the basic characteristics of a plethora of theories, and references who developed each one and when. This book has inspired me to pursue more information on several emerging theories, and provided an opening to the literature through which to pursue this information. I fully recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in cosmology or modern physics as an enjoyable and readable way to put those interests in context."

He finally came to the conclusion that it is nonsense. It is not science in that after thirty years, it has made no predictions that can be verified or falsified. Yet, it has been so adopted by the physics departments of almost all US universities that you cannot get tenure unless you believe in it and teach it. This is a powerful indictment of our academic political correctness. I thought that the English and History departments of our universities had been corrupted by PC. Now I see that physics is just as bad. Read this book. It will open your eyes. Then go read some of Lee's other books particularly The Life of the Cosmos and Three Roads to Quantum Gravity.

The book begins with a look at the history of science and unification. A longer and more technical section on string theory follows, which is harder to follow, but still expertly explained. To me the last part of the book is the most valuable, with chapters such as \"How Do You Fight Sociology?\" establishing the current crisis in physics as a decidedly human problem. String theory has become a self-sustaining phenomenon, sucking up academic resources as it becomes increasingly \"mainstream,\" at the expense of more risky but potentially revolutionary research into ideas by the so-called \"seers.\" As Smolin writes in the chapter \"What Is Science?\": \"To think deeply and independently and try to formulate one's own ideas is a poor strategy for success. Physics thus finds itself unable to solve its key problems.\" Luckily we have physicists such as Smolin to tell his colleagues -- and the world on the whole -- the truth."

Together they compose what I consider to be a devastating attack on the self-described discipline of String Theory.  Smolin speaks as an insider - someone who honestly gave String Theory the old college try, and came away convinced that String Theory as it's been formulated over the last 30-or-so years is NOT a productive way of describing the universe.  The most devastating fault is that no-one has been able to propose an experiment that could (if it came out one way) falsify the theory.  If you can't do that - if your hypothesis can't be subjected to that harsh a test, you haven't any strong proof that you've got it right.  Smolin says much else without being snarky, that IMHO ought, taken together, to sink String Theory permanently."

Rather than demonizing string theory, Smolin looks at the theory's successes and failures and then moves beyond that to discussing the sociology of science in general, and this is his main issue. Smolin says the system is set up to keep alternative theories out, while the fashionable theories get all the attention, and that this system is perhaps the reason why theoretical physics has been stuck for so long.

I also read Brian Greene's books and I think that Smolin has the same capacity of making difficult concepts clear to the large audience, but in contrast to that, Smolin also tackles the much more challenging task of understanding what's wrong with today's science. I totally disagree with the comments of people who didn't enjoy the final part, I actually think it's what makes this book so good, deep and unique. Smolin makes a genuine, non ideological effort to understand why science today is not making any significant progress, he gives a very interesting epistemological definition of what science is and how it should work, and makes a brilliant analysis of the world of academics, whose mechanism can be better explained with sociology than in any other way. Smolin also helps the reader to understand what happened historically, how the transition took place from Einstein's rigorous style of doing physics, till to the contemporary transformation of science into a dogmatic, religious community. The world of academics resembles more and more to a clan in the hands of powerful, established professors, and therefore any attempt to bring innovation is made much more difficult than what it should be. Science has become a matter of power, fashion, economical survival, so can we still call it science? Shouldn't we be worried of what's going on? The critic towards string theory take a significant part of the book but fits within this frame rather than being a critic to the theory itself. I think Smolin couldn't be more objective on that, and he certainly masters the topic like nobody else. A long-awaited-for book, absolutely a must for those who care about the future of science."

                "Text": "This is an excellently written book, very easy to read,and with only one typo that I noticed. It starts with an excellent overview of physics from a technical point of view, without getting too technical,but a good basic understanding of physics is really needed to grasp what he is writing about, and shows the authors grasp of the technical issues, and then gets into a philosophical view of the state of physics and science generally. As an interested observer of science I have certainly noticed the lack of really big discoveries in the last twenty years or so, and this book confirms my view. Also being more of a creative thinker,rather than a conformist, a 'seer' as the author describes it,I can totally relate to the problems faced by people seeking a career in science, and the need to conform to currently popular programs and research where economic imperitives take precedence over original thinking,or even fundamental work, and where universities operate to build an image to attract students based on hype over substance. Its what put me off a career in science, and a university education, as I'm not interested in doing what others want in return for money,career,etc. The authors comment about some of the best scientists of the past being wealthy enough to support themselves in doing as they pleased is a very important point in showing that creative people are wasted if forced to do the work others want done in order to survive. Which basically leaves only those who want to conform and have an easy life and easy career path, who want to be technical experts rather than big thinkers or explorers of new concepts. It excludes most risk takers and entrepreneurs from a career in science,as you would end up bitter and unsatisfied. This book really just confirmed alot of what I thought, what should be common sense. And it makes an important point that only a few people think creatively,so it would not cost alot to employ these people and take a risk on them, in the hope that long term they will produce big things, while delivering very little of measurable worth in the short term. The book also goes into the sociology of science and scientists. Something I realised along time ago to my suprise was that scientists suffer from all the normal human flaws of bias and blindness, tribalism,etc that average people do,and often end up in religious type devoutness to their beliefs or tribe. I would have thought science would not attract such people, but it does,as the authors experience shows in confirming what I beleived just from watching science shows on TV,etc. Science would be an excellent career if not for the fact it suffers from the same B.S. that afflicts most human organisations and puts people like myself right off getting involved at all. The author is smart enough to realise that science must attract talent and compete with others for it,and his criticisms are done out of love for science and physics,not hate. It is interesting to see how carefully he treads in crisicising others, which just goes to show how religion-like science had become, and how risky it is to be a heretic, which so goes against what science should stand for,like open debate, constant questioning of all beleifs,etc, when ego's start getting in the way you might as well do something else, as its no better than any other politics or belief system. If you care about science this book raises many important points ,although I suspect it will find an audience with those that sympathise with its views and have no effect on those that need to learn from it most,as they will have closed minds and take all criticism as an attack to be defended against.A very enjoyable read."

                "Text": "Many of today's discussions about cosmology rave about string theory. As a non-physicist it is difficult to form my own opinion about this as the mathematics needed to understand the theory is daunting. In this book however, Smolin has concisely explained the benefits of string theory as well as its weaknesses. Although it is easy to obtain an inaccurate view of the merits of a topic by reading a single book, this book appears to provide convincing arguments about why string theory is off track or that other avenues of basic research also need to be studied. I particularly liked the sections on the politics of scientific research. The importance of older high profile people in deciding the best scientific problems to study has not received the attention in the popular press that it should have. Too often the views of senior scientists are taken as gospel and, like in many other areas of life, these views are often incorrect. If you study the Arts in university it is well recognized that to get good marks in a subject you need to understand the lecturer's biases and feed them back to him/her during exams - independent thought in the Arts that is at odds with the lecturer only results in poor marks. It needs to be more widely appreciated that this also applies to scientific research."

You will learn why the LHC is really important to physicists and why the Higgs boson is overhyped. The book was written before the LHC was turned on but I was able to intuitively grasp that the Higgs boson was not an exciting experimental discovery for physics, which was very gratifying. Smolin is a real science writer among the best, like Hawking or Stephen Jay Gould. The complex concepts involved might make it a slow read, but it is gripping from the start and not only makes a strong case against string theory but helps you understand the standard model, particle physics in general, and even why science works at all. It made me wonder what the reaction to this book was in the scientific community because it lays out the flaws of the string theory world so precisely. I wonder whether it has had a notable impact 7 years on."

                "Text": "This is an enjoyable read; the physics is presented in an entertaining way, and who doesn't love a good enlightening argument. Smolin has been told once in a public forum (a BBC debate) that his arguments don't belong in such a mass-produced book and should be kept in-house on the arxiv.  Much of modern physics is funded by tax-payers, and Smolin does them a great service bringing this debate to their attention. Needless to say, the opposing side to this debate also have their books, Susskind's \"The Cosmic Landscape\" would be a good companion book to this one, for example.  Finally, it should be noted that this debate has been over-hyped in the press; science in general is full of energetic and sometimes vociferous debates.  It is a strength, and so Smolin's book shouldn't be seen as a sign of of disunity as much as it is a representation--in pop-science format--of the healthy back-and-forth that goes on in the field."

The physics discussed in the long introduction and chapter one was impressively accurate and clear. I'm a physicist of the older generation and not a trained in particle physics although I do know the major results of the standard theory and so I benefit from his discussion and appreciate being further educated. For years I have wondered what has happened to string physics and was not impressed by the apparent paucity of its results. Doing very advanced math is useless if results are meager and seem unlikely to get better. It's too bad since there are many fruitful areas to study and put resources into."

I love lee's way of grasping the Universe's sicrets through the realm of plain visualization. It is a breath taking testimony of our enigmatic nature, written by a man who kept his way in a humble and discreet way, analizing and rethinking again till his intelectual spirit flies free.

Dr. Smolin explains in very lucid terms the fundamental questions remaining to be answered in foundational physics and gives an equally articulate overview of recent theories.  The last section of the book gives an honest and courageous analysis of the pervasive culture in academia that no longer nurtures the most able and creative members of our species. While this has had profound effects on progress in physics, it is by no means limited to this discipline.  Squelching the creativity of the gifted child all too often and sadly starts in preschool and doesn't improve as the years go by."

As with everything else in the world, the power of money has more to do with scientific progress than anything else.  I am glad that Dr. Smolin has made the effort to set down the issues.  The fact that 97% of the content of the universe is unexplained must give any thinking person pause.  Clearly this represents an unprecedented opportunity. To take advantage will require a fresh approach.  \"The Trouble With Physics\" presents a perspective on where we are, how we got here, and where a new approach might originate."

Smolin, along with Peter Woit (who also dared to go against the 'establishment') should be thanked for bringing this house-of-crashing cards to the public's attention. Despite pitiful and below-the-belt attacks and outright dismissal by members of the 'stringy' establishment, including a scathing and unprovoked attack by a theorist from Harvard who sees a threat in works of this nature, Smolin gives us a thoughful and provoking look at the many failures (and occasional mathematical successes) of the most overhyped theory in the history of science."

The main lesson I drew from this book is parallel to the muscle bound theories of brane world physics, which exclude LQG's quantum bounce, and vice versa. Eventually a major re do of the early universe theories is in order, and likely Smollen will be the person who can do it. As a dabbler in terms of cosmology, I can only wish people of Smollens calibre good luck in what will be an exciting period of theoretical physics, once people learn enough to be able to do the necessary investigative leg work."

When he states that that speed can go faster than light's, I tend to agree with this heretical thought. Light travels NOT in constant speed, all because light has different wave length components. And I maintain that entropy does NOT increase with time, that in theory the universe in entirety aims for perfection; that the \"destruction\" or \"mess\" created in the universal individualistic processes create the stages for the next spiral for \"greater glory\" without implicating any religious meaning to this assertion. Nowadays, another U-turn is taking place: that the Black Hole is not an inescapable locale, that in theory Black Holes are picky devourers, that only a minuscule of the matter and energy that pass through a Black Hole (about 5%) are kept. I expect that before man can come to A Grand Theory, many of what science accepts now as theory is just the seminal start of a hypothesis."

                "Text": "Excellent read.  Smolin's critique of string-them-along string theory in What's Wrong with Physics is greatly superior to Greene's cheerleading treatment of the same topic in The Elegant Universe.  It is interesting the way that physics is being corrupted in a similar way to the financial system in the current crises causing a meltdown on Wall Street: people spewing out equations that nobody really understands and that have little relation to reality.  But Smolin, while enlightening in his insider insights into the achievements and failures of string theory, falls into many of the same faulty assumptions of contemporary physics.  My own view is that special relativity was fairly brilliant, but general relativity is essentially flawed.  Physicists pay too much homage to Einstein, without admitting that he could be wrong.  Remember that nobody has ever found a gravity wave, but general relativity appears to be premised on their existence.  It would be more profitable to seek to create a theory that explicitly makes gravity waves impossible than to continue to believe in any theory where they exist.  And the entire program of unification is suspect.  Why should the Universe require unification when everything we know points to simply finding, over time, that it contains more and more things and phenomena -- different laws at different scales of spatial dimension -- and becomes bigger and bigger than we ever thought before?  The Universe seems to require diversity, not unification.  And while physics flounders, there are legitimate advances in related fields: our understanding of the information sciences and the concept of entropy appear to be critical for any advances in physics."
