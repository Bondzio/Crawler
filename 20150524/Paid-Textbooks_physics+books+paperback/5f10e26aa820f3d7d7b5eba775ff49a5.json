                "Text": "It's a great feeling to come back tired from work and pick up such a book. After all, like most people I rarely have time to ponder seriously about the universe and the meaning of time and space.I am a high school French teacher so my training in science is rather limited. But after a few hours spent thinking about time,space, distance, energy and matter with Cox and Forshaw,I felt enlightened and rejuvenated! It really read like a thriller, whenever I put the book down I could not stop thinking about it and at dinner I could not shut up about it. The more my friends asked me questions about what I read the more I felt like going back and re-reading until I could explain it in my own words. Now that I am done with it, it's haunting me, driving home or playing with my cat; it keeps me thinking..."

                "Text": "For someone who never found the light clocks and shrinking meter sticks of the standard attempts to explain relativity without math very comprehensible, this book does a better job of presenting more intuitive models for nonintuitive concepts.  You have to accept that Einstein's theories, which flow naturally out of the existence of a universal speed limit, have been experimentally validated:  the muon that should decay in 2.2 milliseconds actually does take 29 times more seconds to \"die\" when it is accelerated to almost the universal speed limit.  In other words, from the standpoint of an observer at rest with respect to the muon, the muon lives longer as it gets closer to the speed limit.  The authors tell you to imagine a spacetime world where speed and time, added together, are conserved.  So as you use up more of your velocity vector, you use up less time, so your time slows down from the standpoint of an observer.  A photon, which is going at the universal speed limit, apparently does not age.  While the layperson can \"get\" this concept, since it is not that dissimilar to Newtonian concepts, when you sit back and think about it, it unfortunately still makes no sense, and your rational brain keeps saying, \"there must be some other explanation for this.\" The authors say that from the standpoint of the muon, which still thinks it is living 2.2 milliseconds, the space that it's traversing must shrink.  At other points they tell us the muon itself is shrinking at high speeds.  Are both of these true? Is the natural consequence of this that all photons are everywhere at once -- is all of space just a point to a photon?  If photons have no mass then why do massive objects, like black holes, have an effect on them?  The authors wait until the last few pages to disclose that the standard model, which the book is based on, only works as is in a world where nothing has mass, and that to connect the model to the real world, scientists must find a Higgs boson particle that mediates the relationship between the field that supposedly exists all around us and everything that is in it.  Without that field and the Higgs boson, there is no explanation within the current model for mass.  In other words, our entire understanding of the world of quantum mechanics and relativity may soon turn out to be based on mistaken assumptions.  The definitive book for the layperson on this subject has yet to be written, but in the meantime, this is a good place to start."

                "Text": "Every few years I read a book on physics written for the lay person.  Most of them are pretty good, but make the mistake of covering too much ground i.e. relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory.  This book focuses on relativity and the most famous equation in scientific history E = mc2.  As the title suggests, the book does an admirable job in making the theory accessible and also delivers on the promise of explaining why we should care.  It is the only book of its type to take the mystery out of why the speed of light should be related to energy or mass.  I am not giving much away by revealing that the speed of light is somewhat of a red herring.  \"C\", it is explained, is the cosmic speed limit.  It also happens to be the speed of light because it can be derived that it is the speed of a massless particle.  The writing is witty and engaging.  The small amount of math presented does not go beyond basic high school trigonometry."

                "Text": "I feel this book has given me the best understanding of Einstein's theory I have managed to assimilate to date.  This is a difficult topic but the book does reveal that at least some of it is no different than understanding the ratios in everyday math associations.  The genius of the equation is that Einstein found ratios in elements of the universe that, until he came up with the equation, no one else had considered to be related.  But, since time, mass and energy do appear to be connected by an ever mounting body of experimental evidence that supports the equation, it also means that the ratios captured in the equation indicate how the amounts of the constituents of the equation flow into balance as the different elements change in relationship to each other.  The book still remains top heavy on the math part for me but it did give me enough clarity to be able to get it into a prose format for myself that did seriously improve my sense of understanding of this amazing formula."

                "Text": "This is a marvelous book, which provides an amazingly straightforward insight in the geometry of the space time continuum and explains why the speed of light is the most important physical constant which keeps our universe together. Furthermore, it is intriguing that in Minkowski 's mathematical framework for general relativity, the famous Pythagorean Theorem, which defines distance in Euclidean Geometry, just changes its sign to describe distance in the curved Riemann geometry for space time. Just changing the sign gives irrefutable proof that the speed of light cannot be exceeded. It should be observed that the speed of light is basically the speed of particles without mass (like photons). And here the magic realtionship between the speed of \"light\" and the still not very well understood concept of mass is established (we first need to find the Higgs particle). This further reveals in a very simple and straightforward manner Einstein's Special and General Relativity and demonstrates that e=mc2. I never expected modern physics to be this easy. It now becomes simple to live in 4 dimensions"

                "Text": "I admire this book enormously. It's the very best of it's kind. Jeff Forshaw is an impressive thinker in the field, particularly well-regarded for his work on the phenomenology of elemental particle physics at the University of Manchester, and his work at the LHC. Brian Cox, of course, is a good-looking star in the UK, with a cute accent. But it's the intelligence and grace behind the vision here, the generosity of the clear and compelling prose. I've heard Jeff Forshaw speak, and I'm in no doubt that he's the brain behind the method and attack of this impressive work on a subject that's notoriously difficult to explain to non-scientists. I knew a fair amount before I began the book, but I know much more now, and have new ways to make sense of the field to my friends. What a clever book, what a remarkable team. I can't wait for the next book and to see Jeff and Brian do a TV science- show for children, using puppets and fuzzy toys to explain this usually impenetrable science. I'd love to be on such a team. What a piece of work this book is. More hat's off!"

The idea behind the book is that this very complex and intriguing topic would be explained in simple terms with the reader being asked to understand Pythagoras theorem only. The idea of clocks moving slowly is explained really well with this approach but the best explanation in my view is the concept of absolute space, while I did not feel the same about space-time, even though the author had made immense effort to do so. While I understand the topic is too complex without fundamental understanding basic algebra the premise of knowing only Pythagoras theorem is very short lived in the book, also I would have liked to more about Newton\u2019s view of space and time than what is made available in the book, still I commend the author for writing such a great book and recommend this book as best starter on this topic."

There's good coverage of relativity (special and general), plus some coverage of particle physics (standard model), and just a dash of quantum mechanics. My only problem is that while the authors address how length and time change as velocities approach the speed of light, I did not find any direct mention of how mass appears to change (rest mass versus relativistic mass). Therefore the book may sometimes be confusing to anyone unfamiliar with modern physics (which is the target audience) ... for example, the book describes how photons have energy, but also have zero mass, yet the entire book is obviously about E = mc^2, an equation which apparently does not make any sense (non-zero = zero?) given the incomplete (or at least implicit) presentation provided by the book. For some readers, this may be a confusing presentation flaw, and probably should have been more explicitly addressed."

They cover the relativity of time, the constant velocity of light, and many other related concepts from a very basic view all the way down to the underlying equations.  Perhaps the most important concept covered is 'spacetime' as an invariant.  Their entertaining and illuminating prose is illustrated by their discription of this idea:  \"...everything hurtles through spacetime at the same speed,.... Light just happens to use up all of its spacetime speed quota on motion through space, and in so doing travels at the cosmic speed limit.\" This book is an intellectual treat that, for most, will require several visits -- a welcome prospect."

Using only minimal math, this book gives us a very clear explanation of what Einstein's wonderful equation actually means and explains very lucidly how this leads to an understanding of space and time that is radically different from Newton. We are introduced to spacetime, a notoriously mind-bending concept, with expert guidance. Without glossing over the difficulties in abandoning our intuitive concepts of absolute space and time, we are lead down the same paths that the science of modern physics has traversed in its journey from Aristotle's earth centered universe to Einstein's spacetime, and we are left with a real understanding. And as a bonus we are also treated to a brief introduction to the Standard Model of particle physics and its so-called master equation."

Same for Space / Time.  Obviously the authors skipped over some of the deeper stuff (such as why other different formulae - other than a variation of Pythagorus - were not investigated in establishing the space - time graph). But I appreciated this simplification process, which helped me better concentrate on the key points. I have never before seen such a good explanation of the Standard Model formula (in fact I have never before seen this amazing formula) and the naming of 12 key components of the Standard Model formula  (which I now keep in my notes file in my phone for easy reference).

I only have a couple of gripes firstly there are some important points that they identify as being important so reiterating them a couple of times is fine, but to \"labour the point\" on some things would be an gross understatement as some things are repeated 4 or 5 times in 3 or 4 pages and it just get's ridiculous (we get it!!) and then they'll casually slide in some random \"important\" piece of the puzzle in a paragraph and just assume that you know what they're talking about. In addition to this some of their statement are ambiguous and I found myself puzzling over whether the a statement means something is or isn't true."

It claims to use nothing more complicated that Pythagoras, but be prepared for a bit more than that, and a retreat into equations later in the book that to me obscured the concepts more than I was prepared for. Some of the powerful insights of the discoverers were put forward rather too suddenly and I couldn't always grasp how they were arrived at. I would have preferred more measured steps in these places. In summary I value what I have learnt from this book, and imagine that if I need to, I can re-read and work though those parts that I didn't get the first time."

It makes leaps and assumptions of knowledge that are only suitable for those steeped in Physics, and its math is difficult to understand. For those capable of understanding what the authors are saying, this book will be boring. For those with only a basic understanding of relativity who are seeking to gain a deeper insight, only disappointment and frustration await them."

I am not sure what has happened, but I had hoped to give this as a gift to my son on his graduation in Law. It is a topic of special interest as we both say Einstein's letter with the formula in it.
