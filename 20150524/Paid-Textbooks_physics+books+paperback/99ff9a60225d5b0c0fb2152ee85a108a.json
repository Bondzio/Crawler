Not for casual reading as it is full of mathematical equations; but as the author says in the preface the maths can be safetly ignored while still making the book understandable with some efforts. Covers everything from Relativity, Quantum Physics to String Theory. Penrose also explains the maths required to understand the various concepts. In all a great book from the master who gave us 'The Emperors New Mind' and 'Shadows of the Mind'."

                "Text": "Besides Lisa Randall's excellent book Warped Passages, \"The Road to Reality\" by Roger Penrose is currently THE book to get in popular physics. Although I have to admit when I got my copy I was in for a surprise. I had seen the high sales rankings and was expecting typical Penrose fair, instead what I found was an ambitious effort that could be akin to a principia for the masses. Penrose basically has the book divided into two parts. In part I, he takes us on a tour of mathematics, devoting a chapter to almost every branch of the field. There are chapters on calculus, complex variables, fourier analysis, group theory, you name it. I find his writing style kind of tough going, his explanations are clear enough but something about it has made me want to take this book in small chunks. This is the only reason I don't give the book 5 stars. Anyway, he doesn't hold back, not only writing a popular book that includes the equations but even assigning little homework problems! Moving on, the second half of the book is devoted to physics. Like the math presentation, Penrose devotes chapters to every topic in physics, so you'll find quantum mechanics, relativity, cosmology, black holes and string theory all here, presented in exquisite detail. In the end I think if you are interested in string theory, cosmology, quantum theory and the like, then you should get the book. Just plan on taking your time to read it."

                "Text": "The product of his own search for the Road to Reality, this book is a masterpiece of completeness. Expecting the usual fair for the popular science book, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this book includes a surprising amount of mathematical detail. While this may put some readers off, those who put in the effort to read through it will come out with a deeper understanding of physics and cosmology than they had going in. After addressing the roots of science and basic mathematics discovered by the ancient Greeks, Penrose goes on a tour of mathematics. This includes topics such as basic real variable calculus, complex numbers, and Fourier series. Nice to see Fourier series tackled in a popular book. Penrose also covers symmetry groups, a fundamental concept in modern physics. The second half of the book switches gears from math to theoretical physics, again giving a whirlwind tour. Spacetime, relativty, mechanics, quantum theory, spin, entanglement, cosmology, measurement in quantum mechanics, string theory-its all here. The book is a thousand pages, so if you really want to get through it plan on devoting a fair amount of time. Some readers may be put off because he does not cut corners on mathematics, the way most popular physics books do. But I say its worth it and recommend that interested readers give it a try."

                "Text": "This book starts out as if it were aimed at the lay person and even makes efforts to explain points that require no introduction to a college graduate with a degree in math or science.  (Example: the author rhetorically asks how one can have a square root of a negative number.)  And yet, less than one-fifth of the way into the book, he proceeds from assuming you don't know what a complex number is to requiring understanding of Riemannian geometry.  The author attempts to provide more than mere nonmathematical philosophizing as some slimmer books have done, but the failure is that his presentation quickly outstrips understanding.  This brings us back full circle to accepting on faith what the undoubtedly brilliant author has to say, but now in the form of a tedious, 1000+ page tome."

He recommended it despite the fact that I am not a strong student of math or physics. I was pleasantly surprised!  Penrose has a way of making complex math and physic ideas relatively \"easy\" to understand.  In fact, I would go so far to say that his writing and illustrations are beautifully clear. I spent a lot of time reading the book and cursing my high school and college math teachers/professors for not being nearly as thorough and clear in their explanations of concepts as Penrose. Yes, it took me a while to get through 1000 pages or so of mathy/physics stuff, but the fact that I actually wanted to keep going at all is a testament to the clarity and genius of Mr. Penrose. This book is so worth it! The best substantive reading I have done in a while!"

I very quickly progressed through the stages of wishing for a million dollars.  By the time I was a teenager I used to wish that I could understand everything in the universe.  By the time I was an undergraduate student in college I used to wish I could be arrested, put in jail for a few years and just catch up enough to do justice to the courses I was taking \"THAT\" semester.  By the time I was finishing up my graduate degree I used to wish I could get all the Mathematicians and Physicists in one room and force them to behave themselves and write some content that would give the rest of us a clue.  Since graduate school I have spent many many hours reading popular accounts of the latest 'bandwagon-theories' of mathematics and physics and loving every bit of it.  My wish slowly evolved to the point where I wished I could stay aware and awake enough to appreciate the new stuff as it came out.  Well; folks like Roger Penrose in this book and Brian Green in his two books and even Robert Laughlin in his book about emergent phenomena have basically granted my wish.  I really fell in love with Brian Green's books and found myself constantly flipping to the back of the book and reading the end notes and saying to myself, \"Wow, wouldn't it be great if someone could sort of flesh all this out without requiring the reader to have a PhD in physics and math.\"  I read Roger Penrose's book The Emperor's New Mind some years ago and it only made me wish for more.  I can only applaud the Physicists and Mathematicians of our age for writing these types of books.  And I must say if you have even an undergraduate degree in math, physics, or any other physical science where you enjoyed the math and physics courses you took then this book is for you.  And even if you do NOT have a degree in math or some physical science but enjoy reading the best of the best then this book is for you.  I hope everyone will enjoy it as much as I have."

                "Text": "This truly is an excellent guide to our current scientific knowledge qua math and physics. However, this book has not been distinguished clearly as the advanced read it is.  Rather, it has been marketed to the average pop-sci reader. Without a solid math background you will flounder while reading this book. One other concern I have is that Sir Roger expends little effort in thoroughly describing current concepts in string and M-theory, while focusing on his own twistor theory. While it's natural for a scientist and author to spend more time on his own ideas, it seems that a \"complete guide\" ought to address competing theories completely, especially when the competition has more support amongst physicists than does twistor theory at the time of writing."

                "Text": "Many reviewers are harping on the mathematical density of this book as the cause of its failure. But, although I couldn't comprehend 90% of the math, I needed this book to lay out for me just what mathematical abstractions the great thinkers were capable of summoning to apply to their observations of physical phenomena. The presentation of these theories in all their opaque gritty detail 1) vividly demonstrates the astonishing cultural phenomenon of an animal species that has come to understand its physical setting in the Universe and 2) concludes inescapably that those who have an understanding of these concepts have a different level of consciousness than the rest of us.  One important impression I came away with was an appreciation for the confidence of the physics community as they assert often counter intuitive ideas. They discover time after time mathematical ideas developed centuries ago are a perfect application for recently discovered physical phenomena so they can't help but believing in their work because of this apparent independent verification. A good example being the conjugate operation of a vector space being thought of in the early 1800's is a perfect fit for the conjugate variables of momentum and position of a particle in quantum theory. Or Lie algebra (1800's) having an indispensable application in space-time manifold surfaces. I had to read each chapter several times with frequent visits to Borders to reference the College Study Guides on Vector Spaces and Tensor Algebra. One thing I definitely learned from that was that this book was not made to be read several times. The pages of my volume have completely separated from the binding."

                "Text": "This monumental exploration of the fundamental mathematics for modern science breaks new ground for popular science texts, and does a superb job at giving a terrain survey of some recondite subjects. A prodigious number of topics are included in the text, from Riemanian manifolds and fiber bundles to tensors and differential geometry. Astonishing to see this material presented in a book for the general public. There is more than one way to do popular science and math. A great many students sandbank somewhere near a calculus course and never manage, mostly due to lack of time or occasion, to pursue the avenues this opens up, like an unused tool. But there is a great deal that can be studied profitably if the right literature existed for that purpose. Much of the material of this type is stoked away in specialized texts, and it is remarkable to see it recast for the general science reader. Such readers will hear of exotic yet not altogether difficult subject matter for the first time. Penrose's strategy is the right one here, and we can be glad he had the nerve to include technical details. The text reads well enough that one can even skip the formulae. Covering the immense ground of modern science is a permanent crisis of public information and needs new experiments in exposition. We can be grateful for this audacious venture."

                "Text": "As an admirer of his previous books ( e.g. shadows of the mind ) I was very disappointed by this massive effort on Penrose's part to describe the physical universe.  As a dropout from the Phd. program in theoretical physics at Caltech I still try and keep up with the latest developments in theoretical physics particularly in regards to quantum field theory and string theory.  The problem with this book is if you aren't already familiar with the mathematics underlying much of modern physics the book is useless and if you are the book should have been only 200 pages long instead of 1050.  Basically I bought the book to get Penrose's views on string theory and the measurement problem in quantum mechanics but here other than some useful criticism he added little to his previous works.  Though the book is inexpensive I still feel a condensed version written for those who can really understand this book would have been more useful. For those who are not familiar with the mathematics and the physics presented here dont even think of learning it from this book - it will be impossible."

Throughout, he has lots of tidbits that will make it interesting to those who thought they were already knowledgable. His cute pictrograph notations for doing math are fun. His non-mainstream notions about string theory, inflation, quantum mechanics are especially worthwhile. This may well become the sequel to Gamow's \"One, two, three, infinity\". Gamow's book got many in my generation excitied about physics and mathematics. Penrose's ambitious new book may do the same for future generations (especially those who already have a PhD in theoretical physics or math)."

After so many pop science tomes(Strings for Simpletons, etc), it was so fine to find a book that dumps it all on you and interconnects so many ideas and disciplines. I'll be reading parts of it for years, and reading physics texts to try to make out the more obscure sections and connections. And I think it's cool that he makes no bones about being a Platonist (\"scratch a mathematician, find a mystic!\"). I'm so glad he spent the time to put all these ideas together in one volume!

You need a firm grasp of advanced calculus, abstract modern algebra and topology to follow the brilliant logic of Roger Penrose in this enormous, encompassing work. If you do have this minimal background in math, this book will delight you. However there is one small criticism and that is on page 960 where Penrose dismisses Category Theory as 'abstract nonsense'. What seemed to have escaped the brilliant man is that Category Theory has become the 'language' of K-Theory, which the latter has become instrumental in the study of D-branes in String Theory. That Penrose fails to mention the very existence of K-theory in this book makes its sub-title, `A complete guide to the laws of the universe', incomplete."

Further the mathematics, while often illuminating to someone with a PhD in mathematics, is explained in Penrose's idiosyncratic style - not always getting to the mathematical heart of the matter in a clear way. As a mathematician who reads popular accounts of physics I found this book to focus mainly on Penroses's own slant on physics. I would have given the book 1 star because of its density. However, there is nothing else like it, and persistent and patient reading almost always rewards. I am AMAZED that this is a popular book. Perhaps mathematical physics is the new religion?"

I am quite impressed overall, wanting a well discussed introduction to some of the primary mathematics and physics that have led to our current time. This, Roger Penrose functionally provides, though at times some of his discussion could be clearer. He has made a sensible and successful effort to write at a number of different levels so that those with no mathematical background can read prose for content and ideas, and those with significant previous knowledge and ability can work on proofs of various arguments, etc. This is certainly a weighty set of chapters, and I cannot comment on the appropriateness of some of the latter chapters vis a vis current arguments and the positions held by other scientists, but definitely, this is one of the most significant and important books of its type to arrive on the scene and with some significant effort on the part of the reader, should repay hansomely!"

I did the same thing with the Feynman lectures. I mess up the paperback copies as I work with them and have the hardback copies for reference. A really great companion to these is Fundamentals of Physics (I bought the 8th extended edition) Jearl Walker (Halliday, Resnick and Walker). Dr. Walker now edits the book, I think. Penrose's The Road to Reality is well written and topics normally far from the understanding of most of us are well stated. Two years ago, this book alone started me on a journey that was only begun in 1965. The other books are essential to get at the rigor of solving problems. But Penrose tells you why it is important and how to approach the process of thinking."

I'm not a mathematician, although I had a pretty good background in calculus, and I've never had any trouble with understanding math when it's clearly explained. For example, Penrose's explanation of complex numbers was a bit confusing at times. However, I read David Poole's appendix (in his Linear Algebra text) on the same subject and found it much easier to follow. This could be just a matter of personal learning style matching pedagogy, but Penrose, albeit undoubtedly brilliant, is not the best match for me as a teacher."

These instruments allow appearance of singularities, which make the current understanding of the universe incomplete. We cannot know for sure what was the universe before the big bang and how it will evolve and end. These questions find amazingly elegant answers from the physicist Eugene Savov in his book Theory of Interaction. Savov considers space experiments and afterwards draws equations. I highly recommend these two basic books to everybody who is interested in the creation and the unfolding of the universe and in the application of mathematics to this great mystery."

                "Text": "This is a challenging book, even for self-described intellectuals.  It's critical to put in the time, slowly, in the first few chapters, stick with it, and see the benefits unfold in the later, rather elegant chapters where it all comes together -- literally.  While Penrose can be a bit strident at times, he makes a convincing and worthwhile case for his explanation of how the laws of nature interrelate and flow into somewhat very unexpected fields.  Not having read many (any) other books on theoretical physics, it's hard to compare this to other books in the genre.  But from a more philosophical viewpoint, it's an impressive effort to expound on current theory and can make even a hardened 19th century Western European old-school philosophy curmudgeon like myself to take pause and think things over.  Well worth the time and effort."

However, for me, the book explains a lot of the mysteries of modern physics in trying to unify quantum physics with general relativity."

He introduces the necessary math in a very straight forward, easy to understand way in the first few chapters and they were fascinating! After that, it gets even better building on the very basics where he began. This is not one of those books that you can read in a weekend or on a long plane trip, so plan to take some time and enjoy this one. It will be well worth the effort."

Not only does Penrose demonstrate the relativity of all things, but also the creation aspect inherent in choosing from an infinite number of possibilities on an infinite number of abstraction layers, each with a potential of spawning infinitely more if pursued. In the end, Penrose shows us how both, he created Spinors, and the universe as he knows it could not exist without them. Thus, he created the foundation of the universe? If there were only one reality, the answer would have to be yes."

Penrose spends about 20 chapters on mathematics before getting to the physics. Not many chapters, considering that he covers everything from basic calc to modern differential geometry (most of mathematical presentation is focused on differential geometry and tensors). Unfortunately, if you have not (at the very least) completed a college level calculus course you will probably find this too difficult. The people who will gain the most from this book are probably those who have already seen much of this material, but have not put all the pieces together. The use of the word \"guide\" in the subtitle seems to suggest that Penrose was aiming in that direction. This is not a breezy pop-science book like so many others you have seen. I highly reccomend this book to college students who are approaching advanced physics. The chapters on tensor calculus are very good. Where else can you find an informal presentation of the lie derivative?  Other books that cover this material are: Shutz. Geometrical Methods of Mathematical Physics, Spivak. A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry Vol. 1."

Maybe im strange, but i enjoyed this book so much. One great thing about it was the fact of his view on string theory. Not often will one find such a view as he has on the subject and it has lead me to question my earlier views on the subject. Also, I had never heard of Twistor Theory before and now i see it has some value and that i may start to persue it in my college career along with the new versions of string theory with 4 deminsions that he spoke of.  Over all, people who give this book a bad rating, just are not seeing the book for what it is. And that is a general guide to the most important theories, one that may not be the most percise at every turn, nook and craney, but one that is a great 1045 page guide to things in general and help people see the elegance in the math involved in physics."

                "Text": "A book for mathematicians interested in physics; that is what I felt throughout reading this tome of knowledge.  And why shouldn't it be as it was written by the genius mathematician, Roger Penrose.  This is without a doubt a great perspective on physics; Penrose does not insult our intelligence, rather he challenges us greatly (and occasionally takes our lack of knowledge for granted). This is not an easy book to read but it is worthwhile journey into the universe through surprisingly elegant mathematical and physical theories.  You don't need a phD to read this (it wouldn't hurt of course!) but because each chapter is so dense with material, it is better to take breaks often and synthesize the information.  This is the universe in a nutshell and the content is superb. Nevertheless, I'd recommend \"The Road to Reality\" to ANYONE who wants to expand their mind and is willing to work for their knowledge."

                "Text": "Obviously Penrose is a super mathematician.  The book is comprehensive and well organized, and the illustrations are very helpful.  The first 400 pages concern mathematics, the remaining 650 pages concern physics, both of the microcosmos and the macrocosmos.  The equations are very abstruse, with very few actual computations provided, and very little physical data are provided either.  As a theoretical physicist and systems/mechanical engineer, I felt obligated to read this work, which took about 10 days to complete.  It was worth the effort, because Penrose does critique the existing theories and, in particular, explains the conflict between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.  He clearly knows that a better theory would be desirable, but doesn't provide one; his own theory, Twistors, has no testable predictions. No one seems to be able to come up with a viable theory of \"quantum gravity.\"  What's irritating to me about this work is that Penrose goes through practically every idea in modern theoretical physics--except for the one I've been working with since 1965:  the Reciprocal System of Dewey B. Larson.  There is no excuse any more for the physics community to keep ignoring this unified, general theory--which is precisely the kind of theory which Penrose says he wants.  The Reciprocal System does feature discrete space-time, which Penrose himself advocates.  But Penrose will not budge from General Relativity and curved space-time, though all the recent space observations show that the universe is Euclidean.  Larson's work and my papers are freely available on the Web; after you read Penrose's book, you might want to look at the Reciprocal System.  I do recommend Penrose's book to mathematical physicists as I do think that his critique of the current situation in modern physics is right on.  I just think he's ignoring the solution!"

It only describes phenomena as they appear in our minds. Math is how we describe nature at different scales - Euclidean geometry, relativity and quantum theory. A physical approach is required to reveal the structure of reality and to show how it appears in our minds. This is done in Eugene Savov's book Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything. Theory of interaction works seamlessly along the scales of nature.  Fundamental laws of modern physics are derived from space observations in this qualitatively new picture of the world. Also recommended The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene."

                "Text": "First, I must state my position in regards to mathematical physics: I am sixteen years old, and have spent the last year teaching myself euclidian geometry and calculus. I don't consider myself a layman, nor am I a degree holding physicist; perhaps this places me in the very faction of this books missed target audience. Let's begin with the first half of the book. The greatest fault of this book is that it gives only a superficial understanding of the mathematics involved in physics. As I've said, I've spent a year, and used five different texts in learning what Mr. Penrose condenses into a single chapter of 15-20 pages! And for this, what most other reviewers refer to as \"the beauty of mathematics\" is really only a perverse aesthetic of what mathematics really is. I truly cannot see how anyone could derive pleasure from reading this book, aside from it's necessary faults, it's DOWNRIGHT BORING! And this is from a person who has spent an entire hour reading and rereading a two page passage on a difficult theorem of integration. While reading G.H. Hardy's \"A Course of Pure Mathematics\", I could feel my brain buzzing as it elucidated the axioms of infinite series, while reading Mr. Penrose, my mind slipped into alpha waves! This book is terrific if you want to find yourself daydreaming half way through a passage you can't remember begining. To give you a for example, take this typical passage from chapter 8, \"Holomorphic functions rest uncomfortably with the now usual notion of a function, which maps from a fixed domain to a definite target space; as we have seen, with analytical continuation, a holomorphic function has a mind of it's own.\" This is by far \"THE\" worst definition of a function that I've ever seen. I feel as if my knowledge of mathematics has been tainted by the pedantic nonsense like the above quotation. I haven't read any of Mr. Penrose's other books, but if this is any indication, I believe he should be tried as a heretic against reason. If you, like myself were left unsatiated by this book, go to the masters of the subject, Hardy, Gauss, Dedekind, Maxwell, don't settle for this travesty of what physics isn't."

                "Text": "In the first few hundred pages Roger Penrose sets the mathematical foundations of science. Afterwards he elegantly studies the application of mathematics in physics and cosmology. The Road to Reality is a rare example of great achievement and a good intellectual investment by all standards. Anyway I prefer the non-mathematical approach to reality. It consists of seeing first what is going on and then describing the found patterns of interaction in equations. This real road to mathematics of nature is followed by the physicist Eugene Savov.  He models the structure of reality from spacecraft observations and shows that the application of mathematics is fundamentally limited. The observer defined mathematical objects cannot completely follow the discovered self-defined structure of the real bodies. Naturally Penrose ends in incomplete, allowing appearance of infinities, picture of reality - big bang universe that now enters its recurrent crisis. Savov reveals in his book Theory of Interaction a complete and self-consistent firework universe in which the phenomenon of consciousness is born from the properties of found patterns of unifying interaction."

                "Text": "The road to reality is not found in this book. Penrose doesn't explain what reality is, not even mathematically. The book is a failure. The road to reality begins with one simple question: why am I on this road? Penrose Road seeks to lead us to the so-called ultimate equation that will unify the seemingly conflicting theories of modern physics. Once this equation is found, however, the question will still remain unanswered, namely, why is this equation at the end of the road?"

                "Text": "Penrose considers the big bang and uses mathematics, which does not correspond to the nature of reality. There are deep problems with the big bang theory discussed in July 02 issue of New Scientist, reporting The First Crisis In Cosmology Conference - Moncao, Portugal, 23-25 June. One looking for the structure of reality can read Savov's Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything. Reality has self-similarly evolving structure. Its depth cannot be followed in the modern mathematical constructions, according to Eugene Savov, member of the organizing committee of this conference. Penrose's book left me with more confusion than new insights.  It makes a good read for purely mathematically inclined.  His ideas are far way from recent observations, which burst the foundations of big bang theory."

What I mean, briefly, is this: the book is predicated on an unstated, rigidly held Cartesian dualism, and for dealing with fundamental questions that is a very suspect ground--an expression of what the philosopher Lawrence Cahoone calls \"philosophical narcissism.\" For an antidote, I highly recommend Cahoone's \"The Dilemma of Modernity\" (SUNY, 1988), or, immodestly, my own \"The Unboundaried Self: Putting the Person Back Into the View From Nowhere\", published by Trafford (2005; Details at [...])."
