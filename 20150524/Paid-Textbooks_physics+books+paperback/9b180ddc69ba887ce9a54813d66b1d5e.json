                "Text": "Although I no longer collect comic books and I no longer take physics classes, I still have an interest in both. As such, it was with great pleasure that I recently read Kakalios's book. A marvelous interweaving of easy-to-grasp physics with an amusing look into comic books (and groan-worthy humor from the author). As a lover of math, I would have enjoyed seeing more math to get from one point to another, but I was more than happy to keep a pad of paper by my side to see if I could derive formulas on my own. The book is written in a very easy to understand manner, and although there are parts that get a little hairy (or maybe I was just a little tired), the overall feel of the book is one of a nice summer reader. Not so easy that you'll have to get out of the hammock in an hour or so, but not so hard that you'll throw the book across the lawn and take a nap instead."

                "Text": "I am a sixteen-year-old boy who, like many teenagers, thinks physics is very difficult and boring.  My mom got me this book for a project and the moment I started reading this book I fell in love with it. This book explains in such great detail everything I have been confused about in my physics class. Usually physics can be boring and hard to wrap your mind around, but in this book it's interesting and easy to understand. The forces and powers that superheroes require to do their feats are incredible. This book  makes clear connections to concepts that I wouldn't understand if the author had not made them so simple. My favorite is that The Flash would require 75 BILLION FOOD CALORIES for him to start running every time to get to his super speed. That's 75 MILLION HAMBURGERS. How he would consume that many in a lifetime is unknown, but that's every time he starts running. This book is worth every penny and will raise your grade in physics for sure. You will read this book over and over again, and you will pass it on to friends to help them out as well. If you're not taking physics and just like superheroes then this is a good book for you too. It explains all the scientific mysteries of superheroes.  I highly recommend this book to all and hope you enjoy it as much as I do."

                "Text": "James Kakalios teaches a course on the Physics of Superheroes, so I would expect that he would write with clarity and humor. And this is exactly what Kakalios delivers. Not only does he explain physics, he also delves into the relevant history of the comic books. He even reproduces those parts of the comic strips that he talks about so that his discussion is always in context. When the physics gets tough, Kakalios will take a few extra pages and explain things in more detail (for example, transistors). But since physics is difficult, even with the extra explanations I did not get everything. Like any book I read, I will skip over those parts that are just too conceptual for me. This book has provided the best explanation so far of quantum mechanics and of transistors, but I can't rule out that this might also be because of the knowledge I gained from other books I have read lately, including The God Particle by Leon Lederman. It was refreshing however, not to have the author try to sell me their viewpoint, which frequently happens when they write about their own research (for example, The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene). Overall this book was well worth the time and energy invested and it was far superior to the similarly constructed Physics of the Buffyverse."

I did get a lot of crap, as I do anyway for reading books about Physics for fun, because this was about superheroes and physics.  It's good that I have 10 years of Marine Corps training training under my belt or I could have lost some lunch money. Over all one of my favorite books about Physics."

                "Text": "Woah! I really never new so many interesting things about physics that could relate to superheroes! I am typical high school student who also has a hard time grasping their mind around all these big complex ideas of physics and science. Not knowing much about physics and especially being able to relate them to superheroes this book really introduced me into numerous new theories, laws, equations, and just down right cold hard physics of superheroes and how they relate to the world around me. The author really does an outstanding job in being able to connect both physics to such an interesting world of superheroes. Kakalios makes it fun and enjoyable experience learning about physics. He puts it in a manner of turning the boring old classroom lectures to a new extraordinary way of learning. It truly does dig deep into all of the scientifically explanations of superheroes. If you have a hard time understanding the ideas of physics I really do recommend this book for you! It is a must have in the world of physics. The detail explained in the book could be written to produce a new text book for physic classes in any type of classroom, because of its wide range in depth of concepts. All of your favorite well known super heroes are listed too! It varies from Superman to the most evil villains in all your old comics. If you were like me and needed a physics book for class or you're just interested in a science book, this is a must purchase!"

However I must admit, you'll need either an intense love of Physics or Classical Superheroes, or a moderate interest in both.  I had an interest in both.  If you really do want to learn Physics though bring a pencil, paper and a good calculator.  I did.  Now the only thing standing in your way is a few dollars and some cool lessons about super heroes, and the powers they possess.  (Evil Laugh) Hahahahahahaha!  Enjoy"
