                "Text": "In 2007 I used this book as a required supplement for the third semester of our intro physics sequence.  I assigned it because of the skimpy coverage of thermodynamics/statmech in the typical intro books (which I think aim to shoehorn intro physics into 2 semesters). I believe that since thermodynamics is central and applicable (more so than, say, Newtonian mechanics), it deserves an enlarged fraction of class time made possible by a three semester sequence.  I like the book's approach of actual enumeration (using a supplied computer program) of allowed states in a model system.  I'm not sure I would be happy with this book as a stand-alone textbook, as I like to see more chapter-end problems than it supplies.  I would use again for my class."
