                "Text": "Bellman was one of the pioneers of modern control theory.  I bought the book because I am an engineer who is interested in control theory.  This book is very mathematical and has very little engineering focus.  This book was near the edge of my mathematical comprehension.  I could follow the first couple of chapters but either lacked the background or attention to go beyond chapter 3.  However it does look impressive on my bookshelf 8-)."
