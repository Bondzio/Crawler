                "Text": "Sean Carroll is a great writer, with his own brand of penmanship. He elegantly introduces particle physics without the mathematical jargon that can be confusing to some scientifically illiterate readers, which is a good thing if his goal is to explicate this topic to the masses. It does contain some repetitive info though, especially if you have already browsed through a bunch theoretical physics books. However, Sean Carroll's book does have an advantage, since the discovery of the particle, that seems to be the Higgs boson, was just around the corner. If you are interested in particle physics, amazed by the standard model's newly discovered member, and eager to fill your curiosity bucket with as much information as possible, than this book is a must read for you."

This book presents the information in a way as to not treat us like the reader is  in Junior High.  But unlike the books that get very technical about super symmetries, it is very easy to read.  It is rare to find a book that has both of those qualities; Easy to follow and good/deep/technical information."

                "Text": "This book was helpful to me as a non-scientist, but I found it somewhat chaotic in its presentation. Some events were presented redundantly, especially the events around the discovery announcement. The book is mostly good in using understandable terminology, with a few deficits. The term \"spin\" is used repeatedly but isn't clarified until late in the narrative. The evidence for particles such as gluons is skimpy in this book, perhaps intentionally, but the author at times assumes the reader is familiar with them."

                "Text": "When the discovery of the Higgs boson was announced last year and the Nobel Prize in Physics was given to Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs, I got interested in the subject and wanted to learn more about it. I do not have any extensive knowledge of particle physics, I surely do not understand the math behind it, and I knew very little about particle accelerators such as the one at CERN. (Well, they smash particles together at enormous speeds and scientists somehow use the data from those collisions to find new particles. That was where my knowledge ended). With this book, Sean Carroll, the author of \"The particle at the end of the universe\", answered all my questions. He explains in a very entertaining manner how it came that the accelerator at CERN was built in the first place, giving a little bit of history of these kinds of experiments, also explaining why we actually need these giant machines. He points out which problems can be addressed with them, how incredibly sophisticated they are, how they were built, and how they work. After this more technical part, he takes the reader on a journey through the science behind particle physics: What, in general, are the particles and what, in particular, is the Higgs boson? How did we know that something like the Higgs boson must exist, long before we built the machine to detect it? Why do we care whether the Higgs boson exists or not? Carroll describes in great detail the Higgs mechanism through which the Higgs boson arises. He also puts a lot of effort into explaining how \"typical\" data from an experiment at CERN  looks like, how it is interpreted, the statistics behind it, and hence why we can be almost certain that we have really seen a Higgs boson. The author also points to where to go from here and which future discoveries might be made at CERN and related accelerators. On his way, he also addresses many \"side issues\" like the \"mini black holes\" that some were worried could be produced in accelerators and why they would not be a problem even if they appeared. And despite the fact that the matter at hand is surely complicated, the book is remarkably fun to read, as even the complexest phenomena are described and explained in such an interesting and captivating way that they are easy to understand. Sean Carroll writes so accessible and well that I almost had a hard time to believe the guy is a theoretical physicist at Caltech. The reader does not require any prior background on the subject. The author also personally knows many of the people that were involved in the discovery of the Higgs boson, which allows him to present many entertaining anecdotes along with the science. Thus, the reader gets to know not only the experiments at CERN, but also the people that conduct them. For those that want to explore the science of particle physics on a deeper level, Carroll provides a more technical, but very well written appendix and a list of suggestions for further reading. I was completely happy with this book as it fully answered all my questions and was fun to read. If you also wondered why it was such a big deal that the Higgs boson was finally found and you want to know more than the regular news will tell you about the subject, then this book is for you. I highly recommend \"The particle at the end of the universe\"."

It is amazing when something that science predicts based on a theory is later confirmed.  This book lets you in on the feeling that engenders.  It is understandable, non-technical and yet informative, dealing with the personalities of the people involved as well as the physics."

The book provided my best insight into the Standard Model and where the Higg's field and boson fit in. The author discusses the physics but puts it in context. The people involved and their contribution is truly amazing and the author explores the limitations of attributions and prizes  (Nobel) for such collaborative endeavours. This amazing discovery was the culmination of progressive systematic rigorous progress, the creativity and imagination of many many people. Solving the puzzle of a consistent theory that provides an explanation for mass of particles, esp bosons, affected by the weak force was fascinating. The importance of chirality in this was another example (to me) of the amazing universe (perhaps part of multiverse) we inhabit. This Higg's  field/mechanism/boson: the name that stuck and appropriately but is the product of the noble. passionate human journey and the author takes on this road with deep insights and honesty.

The title is, I assume, an homage to the late Douglas Adams, who wrote \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\". But Mr. Carroll,(unlike Mr. Adams) does not write for humor or to take flights of fancy. His writing style can be humorous, but always with the goal of elucidating the history, actors (i.e. physicists), and science behind the search for confirmation (or refutation) of the Standard Model. And all this without a single mathematical equation (except for Einstein's famous equivalency of matter and energy). He presents Feynman diagrams, but if you skip them, you don't lose track of the narrative. It has been over 45 years since I took a physics course. I am amazed (and gratified) to see how much progress has been made."

Keep in mind the author Carroll is a CalTech physicist and a basic understanding of sub atomic physics combined with a good understanding of higher maths is helpful to enjoying and understanding this book. Plus an interest in sub atomic physics! However, according to the son, this is not a dry scientific tome. The history and importance of the idea, search and discovery of the particle is covered along with the impact on science and the scientists along with the science detail."

Learned what a lot of stuff that I heard tossed around like symmetry breaking, gauge  invariances and fields.  It was well worth the effort.  Learned more about the standard model.  The story about searching for the Higgs at CERN was fascinating, and the development of the Higgs particle and field into the standard model was excellent.  It was a true collaboration over many years with both theoretical and experimental physicists.  To truly understand the Higgs field, you may need the knowledge of someone that has a physics degree and understand advanced mathematics.  He did a job as best could be done to translate these foreign concepts."

While the former covers the history of particle physics through about 1997; this book,  is more contemporary and more technical, covering through the discovery of the Higgs Boson thought to originate in the Higgs field. The Higgs field is still part of the \"last chapter\" in of the Standard Model of the universe. But wait!!! Happily it goes on to address thinking about the theorized (as of July 2012) dark matter, dark force and strings. The number of undiscovered particles, though mentioned, seriously whets our appetite for what lies BEYOND the Standard Model! Though the Higgs boson is amazing, the Higgs field............"

The description of the construction of the LHC was awesome and really helped me to visualize what goes on during experiments. I never knew that the energy of the protons rotating in the 17 mile long rings was equivalent to a speeding freight train and that it needs to be safely dumped after an experiment. The book answers so many questions about the LHC and the hunt for the Higg's it was like being there. If you haven't watched Sean's Teaching Company videos yet - what are you waiting for?"

In this book, he is at the top of his form.  He gives us the history of particle physics, including the theoretical predictions of the Higgs boson.  He explains the significance of the Higgs, or more importantly, of the Higgs field of which the boson is a manifestation.  He describes the origins, design, and development of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in which experimental proof of the existence of the Higgs boson was generated.  Through Carroll, we meet the theorists, experimentalists, and the engineers who made its discovery possible.  Carroll leads us through the logic of why it is thought that the Higgs has been confirmed and how it fits into the Standard Model of particle physics.  He explains the extraordinary care that was taken by the large teams of physicists involved before an announcement was made.  He then discusses what the discovery means for the future of particle physics and for our knowledge of our universe and its origin.  Perhaps most important of all, Professor Carroll conveys the dedication, excitement, and joy of the scientists.  Underlying all of this is his dry, quirky sense of humor."

As a result, I largely cut myself off from the astonishing developments in physics, and particularly in particle physics, that took place in the decades after I graduated in 1958. When, after a career in advertising and public relations, I revived an interest in physics, I could no longer follow the Scientific American articles on physics intended for non-specialist. This astonishing book has redressed the balance, reawakened my enthusiasm for physics, and brought me up to date. It is a masterly book that well deserves the prestigious award it recently received. I cannot recommend it too highly."

However, Carroll's writing prowess makes this inscrutable subject sufficiently understandable that we can begin to appreciate the magnitude of the accomplishment that occurred in July at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Toward the end of the book, his analogy of tiny robots with sails inside a vacuum chamber makes plausible the fact that everything is immersed in a special kind of field that gives each particle its unique character. I would have given it five stars except for the fact that much of the explanations still eluded me. Author did best he could but I'm just not intellectually robust enough to follow along. Even so, I'd recommend this book for anyone who would like to get a sense of why basic scientific research is important. And to gain respect for the wondrous complexity of the physical universe."

Carroll does an excellent job of staying away from the math of physics and does a beautiful job of reviewing the history and building an understanding of the concepts of quantum physics in this book.  I'm still not absolutely sure what the Higgs boson or Higgs mechanism really is or does, but I can now spout names and concepts about it to anyone interested.  When the search for the \"Higgs\" was called the search for the God particle, I thought it was funny that Carroll mentioned that only the people who believe in God  and the people who didn't believe in God were offended by the sobriquet."

                "Text": "The topic of sub-atomic particles is fascinating, especially the mysterious Higgs Boson, of which we have heard so much about in past years. Coming across this book, especially in light of recent verification of the Higgs' existence, seemed like an opportunity not to be missed. Sean Carroll has performed a great service to laymen such as myself, in helping to grasp some of what is going on under our very noses. Even though he does his best to put things in laymen terms, I still found myself becoming lost in particle soup, and had to put it aside about halfway through because it just became too much like cramming for an exam. I will pick it up later and resume, but a switch to some lighter fare is needed right now. Anyway, aside from helping the lay reader to grasp some of the more difficult concepts, Mr. Carroll provides a very interesting description of what goes on in the world of particle accelerators and colliders. For instance, who would have thought that it would require several tons of concrete and steel to arrest the travel of a few miniscule particles whizzing around in the HADRON accelerator? There's lots of good information waiting for those who can wade through the \"ups,\" the \"downs,\" the \"strange\" and the \"Higgs\". I can definitely recommend this book to the layman seeking to know what is going on at the sub-atomic level of our universe. My only other criticism is to wonder why so many physicists seem unable to acknowledge a greater intelligence at work in putting together the universe around us; some of which we can see, but most of it that we can not - or even envision. After all, there's so much that even these clever \"reverse engineers\" do not know, so why the arrogance in denying the existence of a Creator. After all, eternity is a fact, whether a Greater Intelligence exists or not."
