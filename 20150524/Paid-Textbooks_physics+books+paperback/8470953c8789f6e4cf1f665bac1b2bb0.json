Occasionally there was a typo, and if I didn't understand a topic, I looked it up on wikipedia. Practice exams were a bit harder than the real one, which helped a lot."

                "Text": "I used this book to review for the SAT II Physics, and I can definitely say it helped a lot, because I got a 800. Each chapter had clear and definite concepts and equations that were to be memorized, and the practice tests at the end of each section helped solidify this knowledge. I highly recommend this review book to anyone taking the SAT II or just taking physics in school, because it explains all the basic ideas you should know about every major high school physics topic--from projectiles to magnetism. Committing the equations in this book to memory made me do better on the SAT II and it made me a better overall physics student."

Basically, the author jumps from point to point with seemingly no logic which forces the reader to just accept everything they say is correct. This left me quite confused at times."
