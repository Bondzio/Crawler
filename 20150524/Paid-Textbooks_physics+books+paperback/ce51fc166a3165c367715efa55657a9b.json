                "Text": "I used this book as a junior-year physics major, while I coached (kinda like TA'd) for the introductory calculus-based mechanics course.  Although I'd taken this course myself two years before, I found this book enormously helpful for review, and the students also seemed to learn very well from it, too.  It doesn't give you or ask for the answers right away, but leads you through your own intuition to find the correct answer as well as the correct ways of thinking.  I wish they had similar books for more advanced courses like quantum mechanics!"
