                "Text": "If you're in high school or college and struggle with physics concepts, HEAD FIRST PHYSICS is a recommended pick. It provides a lively connection between physics theory and the world we live in, examining basic concepts, using the latest research in learning theory to enliven presentations, and covering math and physics concepts using lively black and white drawings, photos, and large-size graphs. An outstanding physics survey evolves."

Each topic is discussed with meaningful examples that drive the points home--something many courses or teachers have difficulty with. If I had a tool like this in my arsenal back in school I'd have felt much differently about physics."
