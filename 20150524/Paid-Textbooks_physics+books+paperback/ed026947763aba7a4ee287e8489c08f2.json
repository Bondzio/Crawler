It can be considered \"light reading\" for people who regularly read about these subjects, but I thought that this book was presented in a new, refreshing way that kept me entertained. I enjoyed Al-Khalili's writing style, it was both informative and humourous, and didn't sound too childish or overbearing either. I feel like this book is refreshing in that it discusses some very old paradoxes in new, modern ways. My wife, who is a science nerd but isn't into physics as much as I am, enjoyed this book too. She found it easy to read and we ended up having a lot of interesting discussions regarding things contained in the book. I whoreheartedly recommend this for people new to physics and physics nerds as well."

I referred back because of some of the science or math he used to explain some of the theories.  As a bit of a physics geek, I really enjoyed the modern updates to the discussions about some of these very old physics quandaries. If you are a math or physics geek, you need to read this book. To talk about specific paradoxes and the outcomes in this book would be spoilers, so I won't do that. I will just give it a very enthusiastic thumbs up!"

It should be mentioned that this is the opinion of a guy who \"borrowed\" Schrodinger's Cat  and A Brief History of Time from the school library as a kid (on several occassions). The author introduces the reader to some common paradoxes and a few I had personally never heard of before. He keeps the reading understandable as he builds on differing concepts in each consecutive chapter. I would not go as far to call this \"light physics\" (as the reader will need to have at least a basic understanding of certain issues to be able to keep up) but I certainly call it \"fun physics.\" This is one of those books that I will be holding onto for a long time and look forward to reading again when the contemplative mood strikes. I cannot reccommend this book highly enough. Embrace your inner scientistist and grab this book!"
