The problems in Schaum's probably are like the 1-star problems. After buying this, I bought the right books with challenging problems: The Portable T.A. (volumes 1 and 2) by Andrew Elby. It's no longer in print but you can buy used ones on any online bookstores or ebay."

Lots of practice, and time efficient studying. Couldn't recommend more."

But if you want really good, excellent, challenging, college level that will make you a master, I recommend Serway's physics problems to do, and...resnick,halliday's,and krane's physics book to learn from."
