                "Text": "This is one of the best books for finding out about quantum physics and what impact it has on our lives, from the vantage point of the parallel universes (or many worlds model) perspective.  Wolf's writing is humorous  and descriptive, and the book is chock full of wonderful cartoons,  photographs, charts, and quotations.  Whether you've studied physics before  or are a complete novice, you'll find lots of good information here!  As  active observers, we are responsible for selecting which of the infinite  possible realities we will experience.  As Wolf puts it, \"To be or not  to be is not the question; it is the answer\"."

                "Text": "Excellent book on Quantum Physics, which is a complex field to understand, especially because of the mechanistic frame of reference we all exist in and are limited by.  Entertaining and playful in the way ideas and concepts  are presented.  Excellent presentation of the history of ideas in Physics.  I disagree with one of the previous reviewers, who rated the book low,  based on his (her?) claim that Wolf simply uses the text as a means of  propagating his own ideosyncratic personal ideas.  I urge the reviewer to  read other literature on  Quantum Physics, and not to give up on trying to  understand this complex field.  It's not Wolf's descriptions that are  fantastic, but the field of Quantum physics that we find hard to grasp,  coming, as most of us do, from a rigidly narrow framework of perception of  time and space, which we take for granted."

                "Text": "No this is not Quantum Physics, this is just another book picking little parts of Quantum Physics, removing all the math, removing a lot of the logic, and adding poetic license.  Look, if you're interested in Quantum Physics, and REAL science, there are plenty of other books that are much better at explaining real Quantum Physics on a level most people understand.  Brian Greene has a couple very good books that do just that, No formuli either.  You may have to look up an occasional word, but if your not willing to do that, I don't understand how you're going to learn anything ever anyways.  This book is much more towards philosophy than physics.  I can agree with the first paragraph, and from there on is philosophy.  And physicists don't have 'faith' particles exist, they know they do from scientific observation.  Billions aren't invested in Particle Accelerators so scientists can get faith, that would be clearly pointless.  I'm working to my Doctorate in Physics, and when they find out I'm primarily interested in Quantum Physics I am too commonly asked what I think about beliefs that are in books like this.  If you read this, you're wasting your time. The only thing it is good for, is for the author who's making money off of whoever is foolish enough to buy it, so please, find a book with real science.  A key way you can tell is real books will often try to explain concepts with examples, the other kind of books explain things with imagery and romanticism."

I rediscovered \"The Quantum Leap,\" after coming accross \"The Dreaming Universe,\" which has just arrived on the bookstore shelves.  Wolf continues to introduce forward leaning, interesting and vital developments in spirituality science to the general public.  I highly recommend \"The Quantum Leap\" as a general introduction to quantum physics and spirituality."

                "Text": "Fred Alan Wolf does a good job of explaining the latest thinking in quantum physics, which he himself concedes to be impossible for us to visualize in many respects, for readers without scientific training.  He does this by adopting a historical approach, following the evolution of man's understanding of the nature of motion from the speculations of early Greek philosophers such as Zeno and Aristotle through the work of ground-breaking physicists such as Einstein and Bohr up to the most current knowledge about the crucial importance of the observer in determining reality.  Wolf includes some mind-blowing speculations about the nature of human consciousness in the quantum universe which should fascinate you even if you find them difficult to accept."

                "Text": "I read Wolf's book some time ago and for a novice, he writes very succinctly. I enjoy Wolf's style and wit along with the drawings so the novice has a visual. The author has appeared in the movie What the Bleep, and I have observed that he has moved a quantum leap in his understanding and he is even more witty.

                "Text": "Usually when I read a book, I get something out of it. I was left horribly unfulfilled after attempting to read this book. To begin with, the author uses too many big words and fancy terms. For example: \"peregrinations\". What \"non-scientist\" uses that word? And secondly, he may as well explain the material like this example I came up with: An object is red because red is the way it appears. Come on. At the risk of sounding really immature, I hate this book."

                "Text": "This book had three good sections. One discussed how Zeno and other early philosophers looked at physical space as continuous. Another covered the historical period where Bohr, Einstein, and others were making radical new discoveries about how physical space really (or apparently) operated. Finally, there was some discussion about possible worlds. I'm sure any descent physics book would and should cover these areas, so I can't credit Wolf for doing anything special. Although Wolf did a pretty good job at explaining the wave-particle duality with reference to various famous experiments and their interpretations, the end of the book is just plain goofy with his amateurish speculation about physics and philosophy of mind."

What you will find are cherry-picked Quantum-moments of lucidity, punctuated with the wolf man's brand of metaphysical interpretation.  Unless you have a firm grasp of the concepts being presented you may find yourself easily lost in this very biased, \" Physics for Nonscientists. \"  I give this one star for those poor flatlanders who may never understand the pyramid, as being more than triangle or a square respectively."
