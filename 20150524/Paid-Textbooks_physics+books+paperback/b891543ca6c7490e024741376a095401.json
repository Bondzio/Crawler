Coincidentally written by the same author. And, two, that the reader has a solid level of mathematical capability, especially calculus. I essentially have neither. I was looking for a similar book to \"String Theory For Dummies\" which is written for generally interested laymen like me. ie., one without a lot of mathematical capability. As such, this is a book for someone who has more than just a casual interest in quantum physics. I'm not sure if there aren't better books around for that level of understanding."
