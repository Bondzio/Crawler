                "Text": "Instant Physics: Years ago I was browsing through the science section of my favorite bookstore when I opened this book casually leafing around it's pages when I came across the first sentence which begins the Introduction,  \"If you are a potential victim of this book, leafing through its pages while obstructing traffic in the science isle of your favorite bookstore, there is a good chance you took a physics course in the vanished days of your youth\".  What a cowinkydink huh?  He goes on, \"Perhaps you now want a refresher or perhaps, feeling guilty at your ignorance of the central role played by science in modern society, you merely wish to become a more cultured individual. In any case your knowledge of physics is inexcusably weak and, if you have indeed been exposed to the subject before, you probably regard the word `physics' as synonymous with `plague,' as in `to be avoided like the'.\"  OK, I'm hooked! I flipped back to the dedication which almost makes me cry out in joy, \"To my students, known and unknown. The known, who demonstrate with crushing directness that it is impossible to be too clear. The unknown, who suffer in silence.\" I believe that he is addressing myself: I am an unknown student who silently yearns for information that would be presented clearly, accessibly; information that I can process into comprehension. I have yet to take a formal Physics course at a college or university (members only please). I love being surprised! (Don't you?) Dr. Rothman delivers this humble students unsolicited silent plea for attention grabbing/attention keeping material in this succinct & concise presentation of the salient principles of the physical sciences. His wit, humor and sensitivity for the readers comfort over the hurdles of a seemingly steep learning curve are woven into the fabric of each page keeping the audience stimulated and giving you a sense that he wants you to participate in the great gift of learning.  In the beginning of the book lies his statement of goals, \"...the goal of this book cannot be to give you a working knowledge of physics.... the more modest goal of Instant Physics is to give you an idea of why physicists believe what they believe and to train you to use this sacred knowledge in the war against the infidel.\" (continued in part two)"

Basic demos of the most important principles give the mathematically inclined a nice treat, while giving the rest of us intuitive explanations that actually make sense.  If you can handle his slightly annoying, nerdy humor, this is a good place to learn - or review - everyting in physics from the nemesis Aristotle to the quark"

                "Text": "This is one the best books on physics for the non-physicist I have ever seen.  Written in a light, sardonic tone, Rothman dares to believe that a person might be sufficiently interested in learning esential physics to  grapple with some basic algebra.  Particularly interesting is how he  manages to do this in the context of the unfolding history of physics; i.e.  he teaches you the elements of physics at the same time as he teaches you  much of its history.  Stickle #1: The wisecracking can be obtrusive at  times. Stickle#2: He gives philosophy much to short a shrift and squanders  a lot of ink blaming Aristotle for physics' failure to advance faster.  One  wonders if he has ever read Thomas Kuhn's The Strucure of Scientific  Revolutions or Michael Polanyi's Personal Knowledge.  I personally would be  interested to know what Dr. \"Philosophy Is For Muddleheads\" has  to say about the quantum interpretation problem.  Does he take the  Copenhagen evasion?  In sum: Why are these kinds of books on the  shelves of Waldenbooks but not the University Bookstore?  Learn physics  from this book and do your own philosophy."

Rothman's math is moderate, his  presentation light, but the understanding goes deep. A lecture hall filled  with unperplexed students might not unnerve a PhD, but wouldn't it be fun  to try?"

                "Text": "If you are really interested in reading a book that gives and provides an in depth preview about physics, this would the most imitable book to read. I didn't know a whole bunch about physics before I read this book.  But once I read the book, I can now tell you all about thermodynamics, the founders and scientists most associated with physics, and Einstein's theories of relativity.  I recommend that a person with little to no knowledge of physics, should read this book, because it will answer all of your questions with easy explanations.  There are even a wide range of examples from kinetic and potential energy, to why we have Newton's three laws of motion.  This book will take off a ton of weight that are on your shoulders when you think about the difficulties of quantum physics.  Instant Physics by Tony Rothman even provides the fascinating history of physics from the discovery of planetary orbits, to the discovery of the atom.  Seeing isn't believing, you may have never seen an atom, but you know that it exists.  When you read this book, you will overcome inertia and finally understand as to why e=mc^2, as to why there is gravity and its 9.8m/s^2, and as to how physics is used in the world today."

                "Text": "The book is is pretty complete - while it doesn't cover every topic of physics that is out there under the sun (no pun intended), it does more or less provide a chapter each dedicated to the most significant topics. And within each topic, it goes into detail on what lead to discoveries to be made, and by doing that makes these great minds seem more human and the concepts approachable. If you're new to physics you'll finish the book with a much, much better grasp of the subject, despite the book being a reasonably quick read. Also along the way, a lot of humor is injected to keep the reader entertained. The last thing I'd say about the book is unlike many books on physics where the equations put you off almost immediately after the introduction, or those where they keep the math out of the book entirely and teach the subject as if it were a softer science or philosophy, this book gives you the equations behind some of the ideas and somewhat spoon feeds you the ways they've been applied to learn more about our universe. The math isn't terribly difficult to follow if you can remember most of the stuff they teach you in high school or college."

When I was teaching physics labs and tutoring, I recommended it to my students because it explains well the relationships between various formulas. The humor and interesting tid-bits about various physicists help break the feeling of being overwhelmed. There may be some issues in the calculations for the quantum physics portion (this may be an older edition issue). Overall, a great way to cover the basics of physics, especially if you are struggling with the concepts."
