I am a high school physics teacher and college physics professor that has attended several of Greg Jacobs' workshops in the past, and he truly is a master physics teacher. With such limited information out there on the new AP Physics exams that are coming next May, this book is the best thing on the market."

I think the book more focuses on how to prepare for the test when you don't have enough time so it's not like a textbook but more like a study guide. If you want to self-study, don't pick this one; but if you want extra help outside the AP course, this would be the right fit for you."

                "Text": "I personally think this book is one of the better ones if you need to review in a fairly short period of time(a week or two before). Half the book explains simple AP test taking strategies and the test. The other half is review material and a practice test. The review is quality, but not very lengthy and has less practice problems than other review books such as Barrons.It covers pretty much everything that you'll need to know for the test. This doesn't mean that you can just read this and get a five, quite the opposite in fact. The best way to prepare for the AP test is to apply yourself throughout the class. Review helps, but the test will challenge your knowledge and  thinking skills that you acquired during the year. My biggest problem with this book isn't the low amount of practice problems but the way the practice problems are set up. The book has problems with real answers (like 200 N) while the AP Physics 1 test has more along the lines of F/4.On the test you'll probably use your calculator three or four times for the whole test. It's a very conceptual test. This book is decent, but I think it will need to be improved now that AP Physics 1 is in its second year."
