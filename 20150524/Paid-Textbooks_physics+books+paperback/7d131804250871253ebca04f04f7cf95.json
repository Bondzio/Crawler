                "Text": "I wore out two copies of this Schaum's Outline of College Physics over the years. This is the Physics review book geared towards courses using Algebra and not Calculus. The Calculus based Outline, Physics for Engineering and Science, utilizes more rigorous mathematics, requires a greater comfort level with abstraction and is, unfortunately, notorious for its typos. I find that learning Physics, which is daunting enough, can be traumatic if you are simultaneously worried about mathematics AND errors. Freshman Physics is pretty universal in its design, but not so universal in its implementation when it concerns mathematics and rigor. This book presents essentially the same Physics topics as the Calc based one. It's filled with some nice examples, good and clear explanations and many solved problems. If your Physics course is Algebra based, then this book is more than sufficient review. Just do as many problems as you can until the material is part of your genetic structure!"

                "Text": "I'm coming from a bit of a different direction than most other reviews. I have plenty of mathematics experience and would have preferred the calculus based guide. However, that got such bad reviews that I opted for this one. My intent was to get up to speed on the basics of physics, which for some reason I was completely ignorant of. You don't need calculus for that. I'm starting to play around with electronics for the purposes of embedded development with PIC chips. With that said, this book did the trick. Not just as a supplement for a class but as a primer. It is short on conceptual explanations but much can be found in the worked problems. You may have to supplement with some instructional youtube videos if you're not taking a class and don't have a more hefty textbook to refer to for a more intuitive grasp of the concepts. Another plus is this book is 12$ from Amazon."

Quite simply, after purchasing this guide and studying it for a good hour or two before the exam (I had neither gone to class recently nor done the homework for weeks) my grade on the test was the avg grade for the class: 74%.  I am fairly convinced that without this guide I would have failed miserably.  The examples in the book are extremely helpful and correlate almost exactly to the examples that my teacher routinely uses and draws upon.  Without a doubt, for the current price you cannot beat this deal.  The increase in productivity is amazing compared to simply studying a standard textbook."

                "Text": "The Schaum\u2019s Outline of College Physics was a recommended reading for the Physics I and Physics II courses at the local university. While the primary physics textbook analyzed each of the main topics/theories within physics, from Newton\u2019s laws to thermodynamics, per the scope/requirements of the classes, there was a lack of practice problems, examples, and/or in-depth solutions provided for the purposes of practical application of the lessons taught. Comparatively, Schaum\u2019s book, within each chapter, takes a look at the theory in question, provides the applicable equations and example problems with their solutions, and additional problems for you to attempt to solve without seeing the steps involved. I personally carried over this study plan, using a textbook and a supplemental practice book such as Schaum\u2019s book, for my courses in statistics. Definitely a good, useful purchase for making it through college level physics."
