                "Text": "Although this book will painlessly teach your four year old what science is and what that abstract concept, gravity, is, it is also excellent for a teenager who is struggling through a physics course.  As Einstein said, you don't really understand a concept until you can explain it to your grandmother.  Well, this is a book for Grandmother."

                "Text": "This book is as important as it is wonderful.  It brings home the Big Secret about science that escapes most people: Science is about the unknown, not the known.  There are lots of mysteries out there; the business of science is to change the unknown into the known, which is the lesson, I think, of Franklyn Branley's masterpiece."

These are just absolutely fantastic books for introducing varoius difficult concepts. I like that they contain alot of information, but are still easy to understand. Hard to find something \"not too young, not too old\" for this age. We love them.  This particular one was a favorite."

                "Text": "My daughter loves this book, as she is currently really into gravity. It has a nice explanation of gravity and its relationship to weight on earth and on different planets and the moon. This would serve as a good introduction to force/acceleration, though it doesn't discuss gravity in those terms. Also, I like how it shows how gravity pulls to the center of an object, as opposed to the apparent pull of it to the ground or surface."

I think it was because of the movie Gravity (she is too young to see it, but the promos always sparked a conversation). We couldn't accurately answer a lot of the questions she posed, so for Christmas I purchased this book in the hopes it would help. Not only was she happy to receive it, but months later she is still interested in the topic (which is impressive given all the distractions coming at her) and I can ask HER questions about gravity!"
