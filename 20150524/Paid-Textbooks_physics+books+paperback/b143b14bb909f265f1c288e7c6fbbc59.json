                "Text": "I just finished taking AP Physics B (which will be split into AP Physics 1 and 2), and I used this book to supplement my school's textbook and a separate review book.  This book has a decent amount of practice problems which are mostly very easy, but the solved problems are very useful for understanding the physics concepts.  The explanation of certain topics in a few paragraphs really clarified explanations that were pages long in my textbook.  In the direct current electric circuits chapter of my textbook, there were very few practice problems and the whole concept was not explained very well, but the amount of problems and succinct explanations in this book really helped.  Overall, great book, especially for first or second-year physics students."

I love the Schaum Series as a whole for its unique layout. The use of units of Physical quantities during the worked examples is instructive as well."

                "Text": "I definitely think that this book had something to do with me getting an A in my college physics class.  I think it was really helpful, and the practice questions were a nice touch.  However, I personally wish that they had the answers for the problems they worked out during the chapter at the end, and just the problems in the chapter itself, but that's a minor complaint.  I just covered the answers with an index card.  There are questions at the end of the chapter whose answers you actually have to flip a few pages to find, but they don't work those ones out for you.  This may seem negative to people on the fence about buying this book, but even I, the type of person who loves to have all examples and problems worked out for them in review books, thought this was a great book.  I think the explanation for concepts, definitions, and problems were pretty good, and the explanations definitely helped me understand my class's topics better.  I'm sure there are better review books out there, but this one did the job for me so you probably don't have anything to lose if you just try it, and see if it works out for you."
