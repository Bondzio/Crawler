                "Text": "This book is fabulous for insight into scientific thought and dispositions on the most profound questions that exist for humanity. The book is compendious and wrought with intensive outpouring of scientific theory, phenomenon and information. So, to do yourself justice be prepared to read it at least twice. The time invested is certainly worth it. Paul Davies is a voluble and eloquent writer and I feel very respectful of his wide array of scientific knowledge, inferential discussions and deductions. But the work does have some severe short comings. PD attacks religion, and it seems evident that he very well may be upset about the sordid history of confrontation between the Church and Scientists, perhaps rightfully so. Sadly, PD's reflections on religion are strictly limited to Christianity. There are religions, like Islam, that exhibit a lot of harmony whith science and have a history of scientific discoveries too. PD is unable to draw a profound distinction between religious thought and religious institutions. A lot of people don't recognize institutional authority in religion, like myself. On the subject of God, there seems to be a lot of contradiction. PD, smartly, does not directly confute the existance of God. But then he totally discredits the life-force notion that drives the physical forces around us due to lack of a viable explanation. He says that science provides a surer path to God than religion does. But he does not give in to God as if it threatens his livelihood. Unlike Stephen Hawkings who openly says that human existance in the saga of the cosmos can only be explained as an act of a God who intended to create beings like us. Anyway, its a great read, very enjoyable and one of the most intellectually stimulating books I have ever read. Already looking forward to my 3rd read."

                "Text": "I found this book fascinating. Although Davies states that 'Science may offer a surer path to God that Religion' he states this only because science with its rational approach to the subject may more readily be  accepted by some than by faith. Davies does, however, finally state that  although the universe may have been created in the 'Big Bang' by itself  without any so-called 'Prime Mover'; that is, if quantum gravity acts in  the manner that quantum physics works at the atomic level. Given this, he  then makes the statement that the mathematics that describe the universe  must have been in place for this to occur. Davies is of the same mind as  Einstein here in that God would be necessary to create the mathematics that  created the universe."

Now the philosophy/thoelogy, that is not so good. The man is a physicist and  should stay one, for his arguments and analysis in general is lacking. It  is not his conclusions that bother me, it is more like his thinking leading  up to them. As an avid reader of physics, and a current philosophy student,  I feel a much better job could have been done in bringing these two areas  together. All in all, a good book, I enjoyed it. A subject that deserves  further exploration and stronger, fuller analysis."

Are we here by accident or design?  What happens at the 'end of time'?  Intelligent and forthright, Davies will make you question what you think you know about the nature of reality, and leave you well informed about the many differences (and even the common ground) between science and faith.  I highly recommend this book for those truly wanting to broaden their understanding of the cosmos, but fundamental religious people should be warned that the presence of \"God\" in the title does not mean this book will pander to common religious thought."

I felt Davies to be an easier read than Hawking - but much more enlightening as to the presence of the creator than one gets with Hawking.  If this were to combined with his later works, like The Mind of God, into one expanded volume I would definitely give it 10 stars.  I've gone through 3 copies of this already - having lent the previous one's out only never to return- a small price to pay to turn others on to such an excellent author.  Davies is one of my favorite authors and this is one of his weaker books - but great nonetheless, a good place to start and a moving read."

After reading this book, one might conclude we are no closer than they in gleaning the \"final answers\" about the beginning and ultimate nature of the universe...Although this book is very speculative in places, it has excellent discussions of the competing cosmological theories contemporary physics has given us. Davies does not bow to any brand of Positivist skepticism when asking the big metaphysical questions--which could be a fault, depending on your views. In any case, this book inspires wonder and elicits those ultimate questions, and is a tremendous introduction to cosmology."

It is not for students of physics either.  The saddest  commentary on this book is that it does not present a cogent discussion of  the relationship between theological and physical matters either.  It is  poorly written and poorly presented.  Despite enduring interests in both  topics supposedly covered in this book, I struggled to finish it, because  it was so tedious. I will avoid all books by this author and the editor of  this volume in the future."

Although written in the mid 1980's this is a very worthwhile probe into the nexus of science, religion and philosophy.  There can be no doubt that this man is on the vanguard in the search for cosmic understanding."

I was expecting some bias towards science given the authors pedigree, but what I found was way beyond my expectations. It seemed as if the author was intent on proving science right by proving people of faith wrong. I was wholeheartedly disappointed, as I was looking for those areas where science and faith had begun to mesh. This book is for the person who has faith in science and wants to have that faith reinforced, as opposed to a person of faith who wants to see how faith and science are complimentary."

I was especially disappointed in the mock conversation the author staged.  It  did not do much to carry his point when the conversations were obviously  slanted in a manner to present physicists as totally logical and  reasonable, and anyone that believes in God as an emotionally based  illogical dolt.  Elitism is not very flattering.  I found a lot of the  author's \"logic\" to have as many holes as the points he just got  done knocking holes in himself."

After reading this book I felt cheated for  my time lost in applying the continuously laborious effort to read the  ridiculously assuming writing.
