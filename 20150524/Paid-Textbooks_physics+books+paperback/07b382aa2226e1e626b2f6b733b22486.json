It does nothing but give you the formulas, and the questions are the SAME ones they used in their SAT physics book. Buy Princeton Review, do the Practice tests in the back, and you'll be much closer to a 5."

They are always extremely helpful, especially if you feel you are on the cusp of getting credit, they always help push me over the edge. The only problem with these books is that you actually have to study with them! I know, shocker. But many of my classmates will gripe about these not being as helpful as they say they are and they simply did not put in the time to actually make them worth it. These books are definitely worth the money considering they help you gain college hours for WAY cheaper than the class would actually cost! If you are looking to take the Physics B  test, even if you are pretty confident in your physics skills, I would recommend buying it. Its a $20 book that really can make the difference between credit and no credit!"

What is said in a paragraph could be rephrased into a couple of sentences\u2014one sentence, even. They should hire me, lol. As said in the title, i got a 5 on Physics B, C mech and 4 physics c e+m w/o any knowledge of calculus using PR books. PR books will always remain dear to me but I must say that REA US history impressed me more, but of course, REA is only good for history. But there aren't any other ap physics study books that are as great as PR, so buy this study guide, I guess."
