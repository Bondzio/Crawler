                "Text": "I can't say enough good things about this wonderful book! It is an excellent resource as a reference for mathematical concepts that are commonly employed within the sciences and engineering. One caveat that others have pointed out is that the book does not go in esoteric detail and does not weigh heavily on the theoretical aspects of the material, and while this is true, it does not detract from the substance of the book. It still makes an excellent educational and reference resource and I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to add to their scientific and mathematical library."
