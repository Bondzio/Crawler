                "Text": "Few people outside the world of science may have heard of fraudster Jan Hendrik Schon, until Plastic Fantastic. Eugenie Samuel Reich has produced an intriguing factual \"novel\", based on a superior depth of research and pieced together intricately into a suspenseful story. You cannot help but be drawn into Schon's world, as you come to understand the process by which someone attains the coveted goal of \"science fame\" in the modern world. The story of Schon has been told before, as it was reported at the time just seven years ago when his fraud was unveiled, though it was never attributed a pivotal place in the history of science fraud, a fact Reich has possibly now reversed. But Plastic Fantastic is more than just a great piece of documentary writing. The author has recognised the almost mythical qualities of Schon himself, and given centre-stage to this enigmatic and fascinating character. Artfully weaving together background, fact and anecdote, Reich has produced a compelling page-turner, one which not only captivates the reader throughout, but leaves you pondering over it long after you put it down."

                "Text": "In this interesting book, the author describes the recent case of a young physicist who was found guilty of fraudulent behavior in his field of research. The field involved is condensed matter physics - in particular, work related to micro-electronics and nano-technology. It is clear that the author is highly familiar with the case and she is quite fluent in the scientific jargon of this field. The writing style is authoritative, fast-paced and very detailed throughout. Perhaps because of this last point, I found several passages in this book to be a bit dry, although some sections are really quite gripping. Many technical details are provided and specialized terms are usually explained, but not always. Unfortunately, the book only contains two figures (graphs); several more figures, including photographs of some of the main characters and perhaps of some of the equipment used would have been useful. Editorially, the book contains a fair amount of unnecessary repetition and a greater-than-average number of rather annoying typographical errors. Although a general reader can certainly glean a great deal from reading this book, those who are likely to enjoy it the most would include scientists working in this field, scientists in general as well as science buffs."

                "Text": "Reich does a great job explaining how Hendrik Schon was able to perpetrate the biggest [...]in physics history, duping the folks at Science, Nature and seemingly every prize committee on the planet.  But more interestingly, Reich shows how the culture of science, especially the pressure-cooker, cost-cutting atmosphere within Bell Labs, allowed the [...] to happen, possibly promoted it, but ultimately uncovered it.  This is an important, valuable book, and should be required reading for young scientists."

The book is very insightful when describing scientific fraud, but also gives an accurate inside look into the postdoctoral research world."
