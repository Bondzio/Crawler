                "Text": "I, a civilian, read this book at the recommendation of a certain naval ensign.  It is by far the most informative piece of literature I have ever had grace my eyes with it's print.  Time is of the essence for me at the moment, so I will be brief.  If you have any desire to be able to be an informed citizen who does not participate in useless urban legends about science, or if you want to know the truth behind all the political fluff that obscures most modern scientific truth, I highly recommend you read this book cover to cover."

                "Text": "Easy to grasp, engagingly written and illustrated, and so useful. Today, science faces assault from societal and political forces, threatening to control exploration and questioning the value of knowledge itself. Ironically, it's a time when we are discovering the secrets of Life, Hyperspace, and the true unimaginable quantum nature of reality. But it was ever thus, and new knowledge will continue to drive our species. Every adult needs this basic understanding of how it all works, just to keep a hand in living their own lives."
