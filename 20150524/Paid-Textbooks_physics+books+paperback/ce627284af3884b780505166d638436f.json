                "Text": "This book is essential to any future teacher's education. It describes the resources and tools you need to discover science on your own. It does not force definitions and concepts through memorization, rather it allows a person to see the scientific principles for oneself through experimentation and observations. This book could help shape the way future educators approach science in their classrooms, i.e., through the use of inquiry. This method taps into a child's natural curiosity and helps fuel questions to promote more understanding of a topic. As educators, isn't that our ultimate goal? To inspire children to want to know more?"
