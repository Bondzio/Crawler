                "Text": "I am shocked to see such lousy responses to this book. I have been using this book for two semesters in college and have had nothing but success with it. I have over 15 physics books and the most thorough and complete  one is the Ohanian one. The strategy of this book is to teach physics with  a calculus approach instead of a simplified version for the weak. Classical  physics was developed by Newton, and he developed it using calculus, so  this is the way to go if the serious student wants to learn and really  understand classical physics. Also, I have encountered very few errors in  this book, so if your solution doesn't agree with Ohanian's, it may be due  to a mistake on your part."

                "Text": "This is one of the better textbooks for introductory Physics for science majors. Halliday, Resnick and Walker's emphasizes on problem solvings; Serway's makes great balance between concepts and applications; Giancoli's is more conceptual oriented; Young and Freedman's has a lot of excellent problems and explains concepts very well; Tipler's is quite boring and concise. It's always nice to read a newly published classical physics textbook to see how the same subject is presented differently by the different authors. But since this book emphasizes the practical aspects of physics, it's probably more welcome than the others for a college level cal based introductory physics course.
