Read about how different types of puzzles do different things for your thinking.  Especially interesting to me was Chapter 8 - Time: Clock Time vs. Brain Time - where I got some amazing insight into why I am always late!!!  Challenging puzzles sprinkled throughout the book.  I want to actually buy this book so that I can write in it and solve the puzzles!"
