                "Text": "This was useful when I used it.  The explanation is different from the text, which is nice. There are some example questions, which are much easier than most professor's test (so take this as a warning).  The useful part was the worked out problems at the end of each study review.  There were about 5-10 worked out details of problems from the book. Having said that, this book CANNOT replace the textbook because it just wont make sense this way.  If you have a cramster.com subscription, than this book would be a waste of money for you because you already have the details to all of the books problems listed there.  I took of one star because the study guide does not provide very many solutions, and only covers half of the book."

I bought the study guide and solution manual in hopes of getting direct, thorough, how-to answers for many of the questions in the excercies.  I found it frustrating not being able to find very many solutions (more than just answers) of the excercises in each chapter.  I may help as a study guide, but it gives very few solutions to the excercises!"
