This book not only explains basic and advanced physics but it also challenges the logic of scientists from earlier civilizations and shows their falacies.  It is a diamond to any book collection."

                "Text": "Asimov actually explains and makes sense out of physics.  I am Physics major, and Asimov explains about as well as anyone.  This is way better and more accessible than that dumb Feinman lectures series. Asimov is a very gifted writer and thinker.  Although I differ with him on alot of his conclusions about life and existence,  pretty much anything he writes is good.  A another Good Physics book is Einstein's \"Evolution of Physics\"."
