We are also agreed that it is a fascinating journey led by a skilled and imaginative teacher who shares himself as well as his knowledge in this very readable book."

He has lots of links to cool websites that illustrate topics he's talking about.  It might be a little hard to read if you haven't taken physics???  But if you remember your basic physics, it's a treasure trove of interesting info.  Really makes you want to have taken his classes at MIT, although as he points out in the book, you can watch him on MIT's website or youtube.  His enthusiam is infectious!  All we physics teachers should strive to make our topic fun and relevant to student's everyday  experiences- which Walter Lewin does."

Disclaimer: physicists tend to love Physics, and I worked in astrophysics and even a bit with Walter in the late 70s. The bulk of the book deals with his lecture topics, and you will never look at a rainbow the same way again. There is an early chapter on his childhood in wartime Holland and a late one on his interest in art. The rest is on his extraordinary career in x-ray astronomy, which he entered into in its infancy and in which he played a large part. High- energy astrophysics, using satellite detectors of x-rays and gamma rays, has played a large part in our new understanding of the violent universe. Enjoy!"

Some people felt like there were two parts to the book; Dr. Lewin's love of physics and his research in astrophysics. A good part of his early research using balloons to observe x-ray emitters was done in Palastine, Texas near where I grew up. I saw those balloons constantly (most were studying weather) and became fascinated by Dr. Lewin's work when I realized I was reading about research that was conducted, literally in my back yard. This is not your Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene \"pop\" physics book. It is about the love of physics by an excellent teacher and researcher."

It's all autobiographical, and he projects a literary personality that seems vain, egocentric, conceited, and relentlessly self-promoting. I imagine Professor Lewin is not really like this, but I'm reviewing the book not the man. I honestly with I hadn't bought this and bought some other popular physics book that focused more on science and less on the personality of a single scientist, and want to wan potential readers to try to determine if this will be a problem for them before they part with their money."

Lewin is everything a teacher should be: a motivator, a person who gets you to ask \"why\" and \"how\" -- and he knows how to not just explain but demonstrate. Watch some of his YouTube videos. They are viewed the world over. He practiced for those demonstrations (as seen on YouTube) for hours before he exhibited experiments in class. He came from a tough background. Read the book and you'll understand. Those videos are a main reason why I bought the book. If I enjoyed the videos enough to watch them more than once...what does he have to say on paper? I wanted to know and was not disappointed and you won't be either. If you have a teen interested in science and engineering (my daughter is) -- read it as a family, chapter by chapter. It's a wonderful way to connect on something technical, share thoughts and ideas -- and ponder the world we live in."

He also does his best explaining the nano world of atoms including his thoughts on string theory.  A side chapter on art is also a treat as he explains the role of artists teaching us to see differently.  A fun and educational read - even if you know nothing about math and physics."
