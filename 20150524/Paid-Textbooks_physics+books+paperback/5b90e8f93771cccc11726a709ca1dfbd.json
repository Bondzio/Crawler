                "Text": "About to take the AP Physics B exam in May, I bought several different review books and watched hours and hours worth of physics videos. As I truly enjoyed the Crash Course for European History, I thought surely this book would live up to my expectations. Wrong! This book in an unorganized clutter of pictures and mishaps. The book failed to even mention torque at all and after spending 5 minutes attempting to read it, gave up and read a different review book. Personally for me, I enjoyed 5 Steps to a 5 for physics at least. But, if you want to see a bunch of formulas with no true explanation for some kind of review purpose, go ahead and spend the money."
