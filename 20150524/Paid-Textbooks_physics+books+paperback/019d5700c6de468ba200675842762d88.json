                "Text": "You do not get the solutions for all the odd numbered problems, just select problems from the book.  Instead of just showing the steps to solve it, it gives you the sections of Conceptualize, Categorize, Analyze and Finalize. Just the Analyze portion would be enough for a solutions manual and would be better if they included this for every odd problem. Granted there is value in the other portions but generally when working out a problem that you are stuck on, just seeing the steps to the solution is enough. I always buy the solutions manuals for my classes but this, like the textbook, is lacking compared to other books/classes. It may just be the publisher, Brooks/Cole Cengage, I find Pearson/Prentice Hall and McGraw Hill to be better publishers."
