                "Text": "This book certainly doesn't read like a novel, but it's hard to imagine that any book of this type could. Because it relies heavily on pictures and diagrams, and because it surveys a number of distinct topics, it lacks a smooth flow. But no book like this could have a smooth flow, so that's just the price we have to pay. All things considered, it is agreeable and in no way tedious."
