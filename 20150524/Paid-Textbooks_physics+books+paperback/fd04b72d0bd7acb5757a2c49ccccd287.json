                "Text": "This quantum physics encyclopedia is beautifully crafted to be as entertaining as it is informative.  John Gribbin is a master at providing an element of human interest to each of the entries in Q IS FOR QUANTUM,  along with photographs and illustrations in every place you'd wish for  them, in order to further enhance the reading experience.  I love browsing  through this book any time I have the slightest excuse, and I suspect you  will, too!"

                "Text": "If you read physics popularizations you have noticed (and appreciated) the glossaries that appear in the back of many of these books. If you've wanted a more thorough reference resource for quantum physics terminology -- here it is. Reference texts are not generally going to tempt the reader to start at the beginning and read through the entire volume, but this one will. Gribbin, familiar to many readers of physics books, writes clearly and covers all of the significant developments, personalities, and ideas of particle physics over the past century. An excellent resource, from `Absolute zero' to `Z particles.'"

                "Text": "This book is very readable and enjoyable to dip into.It is in no way a technical treatise, more a detailed glossary (topics are presented from A to Z ),yet a great deal of work has gone into making it such a comprehensive overview.It is a handy quick-reference guide to conceptually challenging subject matter.No knowledge of higher mathematics is required to understand most of the material in this book yet most topics and people concerned with the development of modern physics are covered.I particularly liked the appendix at the back which is in the form of a timeline of notable events,discoveries and dates of birth of contributing physicists.As a teacher of physics in the 16-19 age range I would recommend it (and have done so on several occasions)as a  background reference to all students intending to study physics at degree level. The interested layperson will also find it stimulating and accessible.Well worth the money.Buy it."

                "Text": "Just diving into this book, I find that I am delighted with my purchase. It was just exactly what I had hoped to find; easy to understand definitions of amazing, sometimes complicated things. As you read the definitions, you may find yourself flipping through the entire book, looking up terms that are unfamiliar and used within individual definitions. Everything is well defined so you can get a true understanding of what's being presented. What I've read so far has been clear, concise and totally acessable. Not at all stuffy or \"over-your-head\". Important discoveries and discoverers are given attention as well, making the information even more complete and the read even more worthwhile. This is one of those books that makes you feel smarter just by owning it!"

                "Text": "In the past few months, I have become very interested in Quantum Mechanics. My math background is zilch. I started with Brian Greene's \"The Elegant Universe\", found I needed more background to understand it, went to \"The Fabric of the Universe\", still needed something simpler and ended up with John Gribbin's \"In Search of Schrodinger's Cat\".  I am now reading \"Schrodinger's Kittens\". Somewhere along the line I purchased \"Q is for Quantum\". I have found it immensely helpful in explaining concepts or terms that I was confused about, plus explaining new concepts. If I don't understand something I have read in any of the other books, I go to \"Q is for Quantum\". John Gribbin's explanations are clear and easy to understand. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in Quantum Mechanics. I am not sure how useful it would be for a \"real\" physicist with all the math needed to understand Quantum Mechanics, but for this layperson, it is a terrifically helpful book. It is truely an encyclopedia."

What makes this such a great book is that it doesn't matter much what the actual topics are, so many of the  concepts become universal with a proper understanding of the principles  involved that this kind of thing begins to seem like a real education.  I  am in favor of the definition of a charmonium on page 77, \"any system  in which a charmed quark and an anticharmed quark are held together by the  strong interaction, in a sense 'in orbit' around one another.\"  With  great comic timing, this stuff could be material for a great routine."
