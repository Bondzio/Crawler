                "Text": "This is a must read for everyone interested in science or philosophy. Nicolaides traces the birth of science in ancient Greece and describes it in easy to understand language. He explains how it developed through observation, reasoning and deduction. He provides excellent analysis of the scientific theories and philosophies and compares them with modern science and theories. Have you heard of the theory of everything in the news or  modern science? When you read the book, you will find out that it is an ancient concept. Great book for the casual readers, students, and teachers who may want to use it as text."

                "Text": "I enjoyed this book. Most other books on the history of science that I\u2019ve read look at ancient history in the context of what was known then. In this book, author Demetris Nicolaides looks at ancient science in the light of what we know now. He draws connections between ancient and modern thinking on relativity and quantum mechanics. Actually, his explanations of both these areas are good. It makes for interesting reading but sometimes the book gets bogged down in excess philosophy. Nonetheless I recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of science."
