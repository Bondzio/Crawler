                "Text": "Written by Stephen M. Barr (Professor of Physics, Bartol Research Institute, University of Delaware), Modern Physics And Ancient Faith offers the fascinating postulate that the great discoveries of modern science are closer to the central teachings of Christianity and Judaism about God, than is the atheistic viewpoint of scientific materialism. Using five great discoveries ranging from the Big Bang Theory to Godel's Theorem to cast doubt on the materialist view and emphasize faith in the Judeo-Christian perception of God, Modern Physics And Ancient Faith is a thoughtful and thought-provoking read which is especially recommended for the philosophically inclined who are struggling with Faith/Science issues."

                "Text": "Modern Physics and Ancient Faith is another new Intelligent Design (ID) book that focuses on the evidence for ID in the physical creation instead of the biological creation as is common in ID books. As my area is biology, I feel ID is stronger in this area, but this book was very convincing to me, a non-physicist. My main concern is most of the arguments that Barr uses have already been covered in some detail in the ID literature, thus I was familiar with many of the arguments. Nonetheless, Barr covers them in more detail than most ID books and his work is better documented. If one wants to learn about ID, this is an excellent book that presents the arguments in a very readable and convincing way. I learned about it from my ID friends who recommended it highly. Also, a concern is Barr is not a biologist and tends to repeat some common misinformation about those who have problems with Darwinism. It must be added that he often adds the cravat \"Dawkins says\" or Dennett calls\" or related. Barr does a good job showing the \"age old argument from design\" has historically been by far one of the most compelling arguments for Gods existence and then shows why this argument is still very compelling (see chapters 9 and 10). He also explains in an excellent, but short, discussion why abiogenesis as required by Darwinism and most orthodox evolutionists today is not supported by science (page 74). The first link in evolution is a missing link and \"decades of attempts to solve this problem have borne little fruit\" (page 74). Barr adds the fact is the \"origin of life problem is made very hard by the fact that that first form 'primitive' life form was probably already enormously completed.\" I would add not \"probably', but, from all that is known today, the first life must have been \"enormously completed.\" Highly recommended for anyone wanting to learn more about ID."
