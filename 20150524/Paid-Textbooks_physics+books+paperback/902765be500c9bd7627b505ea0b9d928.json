The only difference is that this one is \"slightly\" more advanced, and addresses different topics. It is a shame is it not as popular as the latter."

                "Text": "This book has some wrong numbers and a few typos, but the content and the way the author explains things more than makes up for the errors. He makes you think about things in different ways than you normally would on a lot of the subjects. I hope all of his books will be made available for the Kindle. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Physics."
