                "Text": "I was curious about the author after watching a documentary about the coral castle he made and they mentioned books he had written. At first I couldn't believe this was for real, but upon reflection, that is probably why he never married and had children. It is sad to think that his life could have turned out differently, but then we probably wouldn't have the coral castle. I actually got mad part way though when he talked about not letting your children laugh with their mouths open and what it would do to their faces, but again, it just made me sad to think there might me other people out there that think this way, and how distorted and skewed their outlook on life is. It was a quick read, and I'm not sure it was worth the money spent on it, but it is curiosity that killed the cat, and satisfaction that brought him back...."

The author is definitely opinionated in his views of how girls should behave and be kept away from boys; I happen to agree fully with these views although it doesn't seem realistic in modern times. I also believe there is some kind of a code or something in this book as someone in another review mentioned. The printing in this book is only on the left pages and all the right pages are blank. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this book to people who like off the wall kinds of things. This book will definitely throw your head for a spin."
