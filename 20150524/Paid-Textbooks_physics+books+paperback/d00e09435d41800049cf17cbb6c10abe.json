                "Text": "I bought this book a few years ago when I was studying physics in University, I've now switched to engineering and I still use this book regularly.  I wouldn't think it a very good book for a text, but it is a wonderful reference book.  The entries are short(generally a couple of pages) but in depth with references to other sections to lean more.  The book is full of examples and uses straight-forward explanations of techniques and their physical interpretation.  I highly recommend this title for anyone looking for a good quick math reference."
