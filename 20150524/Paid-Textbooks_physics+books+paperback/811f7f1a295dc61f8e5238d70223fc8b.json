                "Text": "Born and Wolf is a classic, but tough sledding at times. If it is a common topic in optics, you probably will prefer reading about it here instead. This book has a nice conversational tone, gives insight, and is reasonably detailed (but not exhaustive). It includes a lot of practical advice in small-type paragraphs in margins throughout the book (for example, the chapter on thin films notes that the refractive index can often vary with deposition method, etc.)."
