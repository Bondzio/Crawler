                "Text": "I give this book five stars because it succeeds brilliantly at what it sets out to do - to introduce the field of information theory in an accessible non-mathematical way to the completely uninitiated. Information theory is that branch of mathematics that deals with the information content of messages. The theory addresses two aspects of communication: \"How can we define and measure information?\" and \"What is the maximum information that can be sent through a communications channel?\". No other book I know of can explain these concepts of information, bits, entropy, and data encoding without getting bogged down in proofs and mathematics. The book even manages to equate the concept of language with the information it inherently transmits in a conversational and accessible style. The book rounds out its discussion with chapters on information theory from the perspectives of physics, psychology, and art. The only math necessary to understand what's going on in this book is high school algebra and the concept of logarithms. If you are an engineer or engineering student who knows anything about information theory, you probably will not find this book helpful. Instead you would do better to start off with a more advanced book like \"An Introduction To Information Theory\" by Reza, which introduces concepts from a more mathematical perspective."

                "Text": "Pierce's book is an excellent introduction to the subject of information theory.  It is not a text on the subject, although it does have some limited mathematical content which is more than the casual reader can handle.  The beauty of this book is that unlike most engineers and scientists turned authors, Pierce not only relates much of the history of the subject (from first hand knowledge), but does so with incredible conciseness and clarity.  The non-technical approach allows that, and Pierce takes full advantage of his chosen format.  It is better to say a non-textual approach really since this isn't a text.  Yet, like Feynman, Pierce is able to explain a great amount of the fundamental details of information theory without the rigor of difficult equations and derivations.  Any student truly interested in the subject should keep this volume as a companion to their textbook."

There is some light math throughout, mostly discussing probabilities, but not enough to ward off a reader not well versed in science or math. The examples of the theories can at times seem a little obtuse at first, I had to reread some sections, but in the end I found that I had a decent understanding of the overall intent of the field. The main narrative of this book is how binary signals have been used from telegraphy up through voice and then television signals, and how their coding has evolved. That and the concept of entropy - of choice or determining what you don't know with each transmission of information. I think more dedicated scholars of this field might find this a \"survey\" type book - especially those last 3 or 4 chapters - but for us laymen I would recommend it."

He introduces you to those that studied and theorized in all walks of the field. He encourages extended learning and explains the levels of involvement in related work.

It is not only extremely tedious but also almost completely fails to get to the point. You can view some of the pages on the Amazon preview. Have a good read and notice that there is a complete lack of information about information theory. Think that the book might get better in the pages which are hidden? Be assured that it doesn't."
