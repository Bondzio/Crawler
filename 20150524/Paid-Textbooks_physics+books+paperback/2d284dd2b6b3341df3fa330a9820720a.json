                "Text": "This is an inspiring book. I know quite a bunch of people who decided to become physicists after reading it. Two interesting aspects should be mentioned. First, it was really written by Infeld, though thoroughly  discussed, in a daily basis, with Einstein.(Infeld was a refugee under  Einstein's protection, and thought he had to justify his temporary shelter  at Princeton by writing something, which would also provide some income!).  Another book by Infeld, \"Quest\", an autobiography, is the source  of this and of many other interesting things about that period. Second,  this book introduces very clearly a revolutionary contribution of  Einstein's which is rarely recognized: a new method in physics which  consists in obtaining knowledge from the comparison of observations of the  same physical system obtained by two different observers. Though this had  been done before (by Mach, for instance), it was Einstein who transformed  it into a new tool for science. Physics was transformed by that, and  quantum mechanics could then go even further, in the role given to the  observer. This story is wonderfully told in this book."

                "Text": "This book provides a still useful account, from 'the horses' mouths', of what Alfred Korzybski called the Newtonian and non-Newtonian views in physics. As Korzybski noted, all human beings form a view of so-called 'reality'. Understanding how scientists do this can have value for the rest of us. In this excellent book, the authors emphasize general formulations and a non-mathematical approach: \"Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone\" (29). The book includes chapters on \"The Rise of the Mechanical View,\" \"The Decline of the Mechanical View,\" \"Field, Relativity,\" and \"Quanta.\" Readers will be rewarded with clear explanations of some potentially forbidding notions. These are interspersed with useful comments on physico-mathematical method, theory and the goals of science. Einstein's and Infeld's discussion demonstrates their view that \"Science is not just a collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated facts. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented ideas and concepts. Physical theories try to form a picture of reality and to establish its connection with the wide world of sense impressions. Thus the only justification for our mental structures is whether and in what way our theories form such a link\" (310)."

                "Text": "Written by Albet Einstein you would expect this book to be too complecated and boring, think agian. He makes a point of simplifying concepts. If you aren't familiar with Einstein's work, it is really interesting. One thing  he gets into that I find interesting is the question of what light is. Is  it a substance, a wave, both? Another thing, is that the speed of light is  a \"universal speed limit\". As matter moves it shrinks and at the  speed of light it disappears. He goes over relativity and quanta too. Read  this book. Don't look at it and think it is too complicated. I am 14 and it  makes perfect sense. Thank you an happy reading!"

This book is definitely a masterpiece for a beginner who is learning physics. As Einstein himself followed the science of deduction so has he approaced the same in the presentation of the physical facts in this book. You will see a glimpse of it as you read through this book. The book would turn out to be not so gripping if you're already familiar with some of the physical facts. But I would defintely recommend this book to others."

It uses clear text and simple but essential diagrams to explain how physics  evolved from Newton's work through to Einstein's.  Only very basic  mathematics is used (Can you add,subtract, multiply, and divide?) so the  book is approachable by any reader who has at least a vague rememberance of  physics.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this book, written for the curious non-physicist, is that special relativity, then general relativity, is unfolded for the lay reader in such a way that the reaction is, \"Of course!\", as if the universe could not be any other way. I now understand better Einstein's purported statement to a journalist when asked how he would have felt if the bending of starlight around the sun during a solar eclipse had NOT confirmed predictions of the General Theory. Einstein purportedly said, \"Then I would have felt sorry for God.\" Amazing book."
