                "Text": "Excellent treatment of the variables that affect the flight of a thrown or batted ball. Reveals facts that explain why the ball does, or doesn't do what people think it does.  For example, most players, coaches and  spectators are not aware that a fastball decelerates on its' flight from  the pitcher to the catcher at a rate of about one mile per hour for every  seven feet of travel.  Thus the ball speed, as it reaches the batter, 60  feet six inches away, is about 8-9 MPH slower than the speed when it leaves  the pitcher's hand.  The Professor also explains the dynamics of the curve  ball; and why a ball hit at Coor's Field travels farther than those hit at  most other ballparks. His theories are interesting, enlightening, and  provocative.  I strongly recommend the book to any baseball fan who wants  to understand why a thrown or batted ball does what it does."

                "Text": "Ever wondered why a curve ball curves? Why major leaguers stretching for third often take a wide turn between first and second? Why bats seem to break much more often than they used to? This wonderful book contains the  answers. Written by a Yale physicist, it contains well-documented but  sometimes densely worded explanations of why and how a baseball, a bat and  even the players behave as they do. Any serious fan of baseball will finish  this book with an enhanced appreciation for the game. Not to mention the  ability to speak intelligently about how grip and mechanics differ between  pitchers throwing curves and sliders. The author has wisely chosen to  address the questions posed most frequently by baseball lovers who aspire  to higher knowledge. His only failure is his heavy reliance on technical  academic language and somewhat mysterious graphs. It makes for a very  enlightening but slow read."

                "Text": "Before my wife and I married, she had to pass the \"basketball\"  test by sitting through a University of Illinois game in a crowded bar and  at least feigning interest.  The first nights of our honeymoon were taken  up with the World Series (luckily for her, the winning team swept the  series).  I thus consider myself a sports fan (I am obviously a reader).  Accordingly, I was delighted to receive for a recent birthday Robert K.  Adair's The Physics of Baseball.  The book itself, however, did not quite  meet expectations.  I encountered two key problems.  First, Adair writes in  the dry, passive-voice-laden prose of the scientist lacking a good editor.  Second, much of the scientific analysis was simply beyond me.  What I  enjoyed -- and found useful -- were the qualitative discriptions of the  game: how and why curveballs curve; how far a batted ball can be hit; the  differences between metal and wood bats.  While I could not follow each  step of his scientific description, the general, non-technical account  which he also gave was clear and persuasive.  From henceforth, I will watch  the game somewhat differently."

                "Text": "The author does a very good job of explaining the basic physics behind national pastime for those who are willing to understand and do a bit of their homework (you just need to be able to read figures and graphs). The various aspects of the game such as the flight of baseball, breaking balls, batting the ball, and the effect of the properties of bats are discussed concisely, without being bogged down into the details of physics. Since the book is targeted for the mass audience (though not including casual baseball fans), readers who studied physics and math at high school or first-year college level should find it very manageable to read and understand. The use of equations is kept at minimum (the author does not use much of mathematical argument anyway), so mathematically challenged readers can also enjoy and extract the most important part of discussions fully. It somewhat reads like a textbook, and will turn away those who have no fond memories in school. The otherwise fine book has its own place in the library of baseball books, since it is the only book in its class for over a decade. This is a very unique baseball book."

                "Text": "I found The Physics of Baseball, by Robert K. Adair, to be a very fascinating book.  I play softball so the information in the book is very interesting to me.  I can use the information that I learning in the book to apply it to my playing and improve.  I have truly found myself wandering about most of the information I learned in this book.  Mr. Adair found a way to intertwine players within the information to give examples that I could remember and relate to.  I would definitely go further and read any other information on baseball that he has published because he demonstrated a very clear and working knowledge of baseball.  Adair managed to take something that can be dull, physics, and give it life by putting it with the livelihood of America, baseball.  Adair acknowledged the American love of baseball and used it to his advantage by mentioning players that everyone knows and loves, such as Babe Ruth.  Robert K. Adair brought a new way of seeing baseball by putting names and equations to concepts that every tee-ball and Major League player use.  He described how outfielders find trajectory in their minds in a split second before reacting and made models of the physics behind those trajectories.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with a passion for baseball and knowledge"

This is a book about baseball, with physical principles incorporated\u2014not the other way around. As first a fan, not a physicist, I felt that this book was very readable for the lay person. Adair discusses various physical topics including drag forces, trajectories, velocities, etc and their effects on aspects of America\u2019s pastime. To the fan with a long time love of the game, this is a fun way to look at the game and consider elements that may have previously been overlooked. This isn\u2019t, however, a book that\u2019s going to get a non-baseball fan to become one\u2014so don\u2019t give it to your ten your old. This also isn\u2019t a perfect physical discussion of the game. Adair has a fair amount of loosely calculated values and assumptions, leading to broad and perhaps flawed results. To his credit, however, Adair looks at countless elements of the game and gives an otherwise quiet discussion on baseball and physics some attention. Worth reading by the avid fan or budding physics student."

From stealing to hitting, pitching to fielding, this book covers it all.  It is backed up with in depth stats and a lot of research.  It is a fascinating book with page after page of facts written by someone who obviously knows a lot about both physics and baseball.  While he may bore some readers with a good amount of math, it is not the focus of the book, as most of it sticks to the science part of baseball.  Great for any baseball fan who wants to deepen their knowledge of the game they love.  The detail of each subject is amazing and will fascinate a physics major, while not totally boring and losing interest of a casual fan.  Adair did a good job of not overwhelming readers with intellectual physics but still getting his point across.  Very informative and interesting overall.  Anyone who loves baseball, physics, or both should read this book."

                "Text": "Robert Adair did a fantastic job writing The Physics of Baseball. I just read this book and loved it. I play baseball at Milton High School and this book not only helped me better understand the game of baseball but will also help me excel in the sport.  The physical evidence resulting from the tests performed and the various charts and graphs made all of the information easy to understand.  Coaches always say that \"the little things\" win and lose ballgames.  In the novel, \"the little things\", such as laying bunts down and many more are covered and can help teams win games.  I recommend this book to all players of the sport and definitely to all coaches of teams.  It may change the style of coaching but for the better by making the coach pay more attention to small things and winning games.  I also recommend this book to any people that do not play or coach anymore or have kids or grandkids playing anymore.  The information is can be helpful but can also be interesting to the average person. This book is great for anyone that just loves the game of baseball or any physics geek that is curious how things work in America's past time. I hope that Robert Adair will continue this \"Series\" and write a couple more books regarding the great sport of baseball.  I would also like to see other authors write similar novels about different sports, such as basketball and football. This book was a GREAT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!"

You got him right here in \"The Physics of Baseball.\"  What could have been an engaging study for physicists and ordinary fans alike is a highly technical and terribly dull look at the forces that affect balls, bats, and the game itself.  Adair makes no effort to explain technical terms, uses no anecdotes, and leaves ordinary readers far behind.  Just be glad you're not in his class, or sitting next to him at a game."

It is SOOOO detailed in its explanation of the various physical forces at work in a baseball game that the book takes way too long to get anywhere.  Worse still, the book isn't organized very well, so if you want to just skip to the \"punchline\" to figure out what the author's trying to tell you (e.g. curveballs really do curve, fastballs don't really rise, corked bats don't help), it's very difficult to do.  I love physics, and I love baseball, so I thought I'd love this book, but I'm sorry to say that it left me cold."
