This book, however, only contains a SMALL FRACTION of solutions... This is just a way for the publisher to suck another $70 out of you...as if the price of the actual textbook wasn't high enough already!  Don't bother...it's not worth the money."

                "Text": "Do not buy this solution manual. As the previous reviewer said, this book is very small and contain answers to VERY few questions. Usually, solution manual contain all the answers in details to odd-numbered questions. However, this book only answer few questions in detail. For example, chapter two in the textbook have +100 problem. This solution manual starts answering question 3, 5, than jumps to 19, than jumps to 23, jumps to 33, jumps to 45!!!"
