                "Text": "I've used the entire University Physics series in my college courses and am very impressed. The chapters are laid out in a very clear manner with each chapter having an overarching concept, and then that concept is broken down into more basic ideas with a few worked out examples for each. Every important equation is highlighted. Pictures are useful and diagrams are nearly always clear and useful. At the end of each chapter is a very handy summary with all the equations as well. Then, there are more practice problems than you could ever hope to finish to truly hone your skills. I was not a fan of lecture, so I mostly used the textbook in order to teach myself physics, and found that I was very successful in doing so. My only complaint is that some concepts that are explained in the text are not as clear as they could be and I had to turn to external sources to clarify any confusion I had. 4 stars for being an excellent book with the only flaw being some unclear topics. Might I recommend Schaum's Outline for Physics if you are struggling with any of the concepts that don't seem clear in this text."

                "Text": "Well after finishing my first semester in calculus based physics I have to say this is the best book for it. It was a long semester, and I was really struggling in the beginning. In one semester I've tried, Knight, Resnick and Halliday, and the Physics Problem solver. They're all great and help a lot. In the beginning I was frustrated by how long the examples are. Now I realize how important that is. I purchased this so I wouldn't have to carry a 5 ton book around every day to class. It's perfect. I will definitely be purchasing volume 2 & 3 this way."

It is also helpful to have another physics book handy."
