HUGE waste of money and I can assure you if you're professor isn't miraculously good (which most aren't) you are not going to learn anything in the class and the textbook is not going to help at all, if any thing it will harm."

The sections that my instructor covered and focused on for two weeks probably only took a paragraph of explanation in the book and maybe a few examples. And while I understand the importance of examples for math-based courses, it would still be nice to have some background knowledge of the problem you're about to do (besides, the examples still moved too quickly in my opinion)."
