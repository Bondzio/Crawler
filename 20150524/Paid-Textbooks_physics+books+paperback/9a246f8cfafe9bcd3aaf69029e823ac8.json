                "Text": "Moore manages to make the laws of conservation unintuitive. The writing is overly wordy and convoluted.  The only reason I was able to pass a class with this textbook is because I was relying on my high school physics.  Those who had never taken a physics course were lost and lacking the necessary fundamental understanding in physics."

                "Text": "I HATED all of Moore's books. They're too wordy and he just straight up tries too hard. Professors at my university like this book and try having us teach ourselves using this book as a guide. It sucks, and makes everything more complicated than it needs to be I feel like any other university physics text book would be better than this one. He also comes up with these stupid variable names for everything which further complicates things. I'm a math, Comp.Sci, Physics major and if there's an easier way to do something, I would be the one to find it. These books are NOT easy. If I could give 0/5 stars, I would."

It's confusing and unintuitive; there are no answers to the questions or any other assistance with problems.

It's a great book, but sometimes depends on the teaching style of the professor. Some part of the book is somewhat confusing, and using 14 lecture time to get through conservation law and interaction seems a bit tedious than usual."
