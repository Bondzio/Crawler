                "Text": "Good and reasonably priced book to learn QM from on your own.  Nothing fancy and no thrilling unusual insights, just standard Quantum Mechanics presented in a systematic, structured manner.  You need the discipline to go systematically through it and do the problems,  it's not intended just for reading through.  After wearing out a few pens and filled more than a few legal pads with calculations you will be well prepared for advanced graduate-level courses.  Like with any serious QM text,  you should be familiar already with basic sophomore level math like differential equations and linear algebra before diving in."

The large number of worked out example problems are a real boon to the student, and the topics are covered in a logical order.

Although I ran away from being a physics major I still read it from time to time. It is very informative and actually is useful.
