                "Text": "This book is great. It did improve my overall understanding of thermodynamics. In fact, it goes really in details and made me question the subtle things that I did in my thermodynamics course. The mathematical proves are detailed and clear and do not require any advanced mathematics. In addition, there is a math chapter in the beginning of the book that covers the * non regular* math that the author will use. But, to be honest, the math chapter is not very straight forward, at least not for me. It did make me read from a lot of resources to understand what is going on. However, I can not admit but its use, I learned some mathematics and revised a lot of old math to understand that chapter. This book is not a very easy read, so be prepared for a lot of hard work ! However, it is REALLY worth it."

                "Text": "Did you already take a thermo class? Then this book is for you. It helps reinforce key concepts without focusing too much on the process and mechanics of doing thermo problems. It's an excellent second-time-through book, showing how powerful thermodynamics can be.  Reiss makes thermo seem easy, and I always put the book down feeling a bit smarter for having learned something new."
