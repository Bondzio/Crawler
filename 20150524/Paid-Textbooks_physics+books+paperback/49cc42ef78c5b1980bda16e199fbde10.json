Especially the part on Digital Physics whish is so important to game development today. I highly recommend this book to everyone, particularly game developers."

I havent done any claculus since college many years ago and I was hoping this book would take me step by step on how to do physics for game development.  This book is for people who already have a good understanding of calculus and are already pretty strong in math.  I couldn't make it past the second chapter with the complicated stuff in this book.  I guess I need to refresh my calc skills before going back to this book"
