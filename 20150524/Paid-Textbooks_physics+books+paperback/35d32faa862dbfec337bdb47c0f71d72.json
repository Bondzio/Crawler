Though it stresses physical intuition more than formal definitions. I especially liked discussion of  fiber bundles and  characteristic classes. Highly recommended."

                "Text": "Unlike many physics students, I grant a lot of leeway to books on mathematics for physicists.  I think it's all right for an author to engage in hand-waving arguments if this enhances physical intuition or even to make the occasional statements without proof if this allows more ground to be covered.  However, if a proof actually is presented, I expect this proof to be correct.  In this book, proofs are sometimes only for special cases of theorems stated more generally and often contain logical errors."

Without any exercises, it would be really hard to use this book for self study, and hope to retain the material.  Based on the reviews, it looks like the better books available on the topic are \"Geometry, Topology and Physics\" by Nakahara, and \"The Geometry of Physics: An Introduction\" by Frankel."

Mathematics is the link to comprehending the origin of the conclusions that have been reached. While I lack the expertise to work out rigorous mathematical proof, the mathematical ideas are made tangible and applicable in this text. In a search for meaning in the world of physics one necessarily needs a compass for direction and it rests with having the necessary mathematical tools to do so."
