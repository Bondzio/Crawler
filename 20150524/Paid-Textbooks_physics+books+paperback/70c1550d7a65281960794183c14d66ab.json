Some potential uses are, dropping it and measuring its acceleration, tossing it in a river to observe reference frames, and calculating the angle and velocity you must throw it at to hit its author from 100 meters away while standing 30m above level ground."

I would highly reccommend this book t anyone. The price is way to high for textbooks these days, I feel that $150 for any book is way to expensive."
