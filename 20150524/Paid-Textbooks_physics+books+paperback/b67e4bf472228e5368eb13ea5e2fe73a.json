While I'm confident that the authors probably know what they're talking about, and have tried to bring the material down to the level of a college student working on first-year physics, but trying to read this book is like trying to read the Chinese translation of a Latin text (and for the record, I neither read nor speak Chinese or Latin).  There have been times, even in the first few chapters, that I have only been able to understand what they're trying to explain by drawing myself flowcharts as I read.  Unfortunately, this text was required for my classes.  While I am sure the authors are competent, maybe even brilliant, Physics professors, I might humbly suggest they consider a refresher course in \"Making Textbooks Understandable.\""
