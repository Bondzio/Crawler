                "Text": "A bit too simplistic for the HS physics student. This book, instead, seems more aimed towards pre-HS students seeking a healthy head-start on physics concepts w/o being innundated w/ physics problem sets or mathematical equations and confusion. A small glimpse of the concept w/ emphasis on practical applications clearly present physics in a earnest manner to readers. Serves home-schooled students extremely well."
