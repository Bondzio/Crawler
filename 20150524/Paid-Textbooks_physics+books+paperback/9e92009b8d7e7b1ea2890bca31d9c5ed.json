                "Text": "I simply did the problems in this book and then passed the Caltech physics phd qualifying exam for quantum and statistical mechanics. The difference between this book and the standard Yung-kuo book for practice problems is brevity. Yung-kuo simply has too many problems, many of which are very similar, teaching no new concepts. Cahn, on the other hand, has picked a smaller but more meaningful subset of problems. There are few enough problems that you can do them all in a reasonable amount of time, but enough that you hit all the major concepts. I highly recommend it for anyone studying for physics quals, or for an undergraduate with a couple weeks of time who is about to do the GRE. I realize that the GRE doesn't have in-depth problems, but by doing in-depth problems you master the concepts that the GRE does test on."
