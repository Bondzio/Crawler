The most understandable of them all. Clearly written with the non professional in mind. Michio Kaku presents all the information of what isn't the most easily understood of subjects in a fashion which allows for an enjoyable reading experience of the ever changing and sometimes reinvented theory that comes tantalizingly close to the much sought after Holy Grail Theory of Everything. (wow, wasn't that a long sentence.)"

For me the power of this book (and of the man himself) is its ability to excite the interest of the layman.  As a wannabe teacher, I find Kaku's presentation to be brilliant in terms of his ability to excite his audience and give them 'wow' moments.  Sure, maybe he doesn't present a totally complete and unbiased opinion of the subject matter (although I am not one to judge this), but he may spur the interest of a few of the next generation of comologists and to for me that is what is important - keeping people informed and turned-on to science so that they will pursue the subject and generate the next round of discoveries.  I recommend this to all who love to learn.  I only wish I could attend Kaku's lectures..."

                "Text": "I usually don't bother writing reviews unless I find something particularly noteworthy or lacking.  In this case I have the unfortunate obligation to report that Michio Kaku has completely missed the mark.  I have read most of the available fare that covers theoretical Physics and actually requested this one from my family for a Christmas present.  Because of the author's credentials, the recent copyright date, and the title of the book, I expected to see some presentation in support or against worm holes based on the latest physics and mathematics.  What I found instead can be put into about three categories.  The first part of the book is nothing but a brief history of Cosmology.  The writing is entertaining but there is nothing new in the presentation and there is no indication before hand that this is a work of history.  The second part of the book is an attempt to cover string and M theory.  It is particularly light weight, and although he makes the statement that String Theory is the leading theory of  \"everything\",  he fails to present it in any detail.  Finally, the remainder of the book deteriorates into philosophical and Christian religious ponderings that have nothing to do with the subject of the book.  Will, the author wonders, there be concern over whether a clone has a soul?  He cites the work of numerous Science fiction authors, all of whom I enjoy but have no importance here.  Throughout the book he seems concerned with humanities' need to escape this universe for another as it cools over the next trillions of years, a point worthy of about 1 paragraph.  This anxiety alone raises deep concern over his ability to grasp the true scale and scope of what Cosmology really represents.  And, as far as \"Parallel Worlds\"  is concerned, there is nothing new or convincing.  The author says, \"This may sound like science fiction.\"  Indeed.  Two stars, only because there are probably still many who are looking for a beginning guide to Cosmology and a mixture of science, religion and philosophy.  Not to be considered a work of physics."

Its easy to read and it totally boggles your mind. It gives you definitions where you need them and it explains to you everything you need to know in the most simplist way. I recommend this book to any beginner or even just the typical reader who finds space and comsology interesting. I, myself, never read about cosmology ever in my life before. When I read this book, it was simple, logical, and really made you think. The author doesn't tell you what to think or believe, he opens your mind to a bunch of different possibilities so you can see the whole picture. He names all the theories and ideas and let's you draw your own conclusions. This book is just a source of interesting facts and info about cosmology without any scientific gibberish that is unpronouncable. It's truly great."

In Parallel worlds Kaku revisits many of the same topics he has in his other books, but with updated info from current scientific research, addressing controversies like the \"flatness problem\". He has an excellent chapter on black holes I really enjoyed, plus an excellent chapter on quantum theory and the many worlds interpretation. The end of the book is fascinating speculation on the types of advanced civilizations there could be in the universe. And of course he doesn't steer away from his favorite topic-string theory. Definitely read the book. If you get a chance to see Kaku on TV, don't miss it. One time he was profiled on \"Big Thinkers\" on TechTv and I was blown away by his charasmatic enthusiasm for physics. It would be really nice if there were more physics teachers like Kaku instead of the usual dull variety you find in school."

                "Text": "Michio Kaku presents the world of physics and cosmology in a way that casual science fans can appreciate.  The primary theme of this book is the ultimate fate of the universe and whether intelligent life will be able to escape its fate.  The most interesting theory he proposes is that intelligent beings will be able to escape a dying universe by traveling to a parallel universe which is at a younger stage.  When you read this, you'll be really surprised to see that the world of physics is almost alien to the world of common sense.  To give an example, string theory proposes that all matter in the universe is  nothing but the vibration of strings or cosmic music.  I really recommend this for those who would like to get some insight into the world of physics and cosmology, but don't want to burn too many brain cells with the mathematics of the field."

In college I majored in English Literature; therefore, I need books that explain scientific things to me as a professor would in a lower level course.  Kaku does that - he takes it very slowly and explains history as well as the math so he doesn't lose people like me.  He explains mind bending ideas that a beginner might ask about.  Don't get me wrong, I certainly had to put a good bit of my brain into comprehending; but it was well worth it.  My favorite portion of the book is Part III where Kaku talks about possible science fiction scenarios and merges them with science.  Just be patient with the beginning of the book and before you know it, you will be so engrossed in reading it, it will haunt your thoughts while you are away from it.  If you are interested in string theory, but don't know where to begin, please try this book, it's superb!"

He deftly explains lofty concepts like multiple dimensions, the bending of timespace and wormholes and in a way that can be grasped by those of us without PhDs. Physicists like Kaku are bringing cutting edge science to the masses and that is good for everyone. For me, it's inspiration. I referred to Kaku's work over and over while writing my novel \"The Pink Room,\" the story of a leading physicist who attempts to use the science of string theory to bring his daughter back from the dead."

Though he doesn't always succeed in making abstruse ideas completely intelligible, he does so for the most part.  And where he is less successful -- as PW progresses to M-theory and beyond -- he nonetheless spurs his readers' enthusiasm to read on.  It's hard to imagine 'headier' stuff than one finds between the covers of PW.  My thanks to MK for letting us non-physicists/cosmologists in on all the excitement!"

Despite this, I had to repeatedly go back to the beginning of sections to see where I missed the detailed explanation about the latest subject (spins, worm holes, string theory, parallel universes, etc, etc). But I kept finding that it wasn't me: the author repeatedly failed to elaborate and explain comprehensively many topics; his explanations of complicated subjects were utterly unconvincing (i.e. of their scientific credibility), and failed time & time again to show how they fit into a comprehensive narrative (i.e. how do strings relate to what is standard knowledge in physics?). It was as if it was a \"brief history of\" work written for fellow physicists who wanted to brush up on their history, but, importantly, didn't need too much help understanding complicated material. In addition, the material is jumpy, and many subjects suffer repetition. The \"notes\" section is poorly constructed, as there is no indication of what is extended in this section when you cover it in the main text. For so many topics, 360 pages is clearly far too short. Kaku should have taken more time & care in expanding his explanations of subjects, or written about fewer topics in 360 pages. Perhaps many of the plentiful positive reviewers of this book came from the sciences/scientific journalism, and thus failed to appreciate how the non-expert would perceive this book? Poor."

He is the one who came up with the equation that summarizes the field theory of strings. The heart of the electron is a vibrating string, tinier than a proton. If we were to pluck the string, its vibrations would change it into any one of the known subatomic particles. Did you know that the 5th dimension is light? If Einstein had never discovered relativity, his theory might have been discovered as a by-product of string theory, because the lowest vibration is a quantum of gravity. All 11 parallel dimensions are probably encoded in these strings, and might be revealed sometime in our technological future. This book was published in 2005 but most of it still stands today in 2014. Perhaps some minor updates for the microwave data from the WMAP satellite (after more recent calculations, 26.8% rather than 23% of the universe is made up of dark matter) and there\u2019s probably more updated information on the LISA antenna and the Large Hadron Collider which are mentioned in the book but were not yet built at the time of publication.

The topic is a hard-chew, but Michio Kaku made it so soft you can swallow as easily as milk.  It is not a surprise why so many complete physics lay persons read this book and all of a sudden became in the know about modern physics.  Yes, this book is that great, very easy to read and at the time very thorough!  But, more importantly, perhaps most importantly to me, the book is so much fun to read!!!  I have read many sci-fi books, but this book is probably much more fun than any sci-fi's that I know.  This is why I used to often read this book whenever I got some headache.  It gives very fresh refreshment like rural breeze.  I do not often recommend a book for a read to friends because they are just different from me in many points.  But, for this book I strongly recommend anybody to give it a try.  You will never get disappointed for sure."

The only reason I can't give this work five stars is that it is several years old and not quite current in the research (i.e., the hypothetical medium that may separate multiple universes is referred to as \"the bulk\" in newer work, but is not so named here.) I also was left with a question: Kaku discusses the idea that multiple universes may have physical laws totally alien to our experience, but later speculates about how, perhaps, we could cross the chasm. Would it be prudent even to try entering another universe, not knowing what to expect? Aside from this minor point, I found Kaku's enthusiasm infectious and, as his TV appearances prove, his communicative ability is impressive. Popular science's worthy successor to Asimov, perhaps?"

If you haven't yet heard, we live in a multiverse of infinite universes that exist all around us in hidden dimensions, and are constantly being created and destroyed by mini big bangs. The most entertaining is Kaku's chapter on futurism, where he makes predictions thousands of millennia into the future. He follows the model of categorizing civilizations based on energy use, from Type 0 civilizations which rely on dead plants for energy, to solar civs who harness atomic energy from their sun, to galactic civs who travel by wormholes and are able capture the energy of entire galaxies. This is wild stuff. If you have no background in theoretical physics, it will open a whole new door to understanding the universe and our place in it."

There's not much unnecessary information, coverage is fairly comprehensive, and subjects are mostly treated with great clarity (for which the reader should be very grateful considering some other books in this field) without suffering loss of understanding. In other words, the presentations are correct and self-contained, interesting, and enjoyable to read. There are few seemingly odd tangents that must be tolerated, and the author promotes himself a bit from time to time, but overall this book really stands out. Reading this book is like reading a dozen other longer books about more specific aspects of this subject yet receiving the same key information ... more bang for your buck!

                "Text": "Kaku presents an excellent account of conventional progress toward a unified theory of elementary particles and forces.  The educated reader will note his bias toward string theory and multiple dimensions as the basis for unification.  The author has produced graduate academic texts on string/M-theory which are also available online.  This makes him an expert on the leading edge of the conventional approach.  But the bias and almost religious dogmatic adherence to the probabilistic perspective makes the book mediocre.  For a truly balanced perspective, the author should have included references to works such as Space, Elastic and Impeding which outlines a semi-classical approach toward unification.  The author, in typical conventional style, ignores such attempts in Parallel Worlds - by omission, dismissing them as fringe or quackery.  For instance, Caroline Thompson, a British computer scientist, has basically proven that Aspect's conclusions about EPR are wrong.  The bottom line is that he ignores credible refutations of conventional perspectives.  This tendency in convention will only doom physics to become more and more detached from reality - as exemplified by invention of multiple dimensions to explain unification.  In my estimation, it is this and the concept of virtual particles which have derailed true progress in theoretical physics.  The unfortunate situation is that the physics community has not realized this derailment.  Kaku is brilliant in his treatment of the conventional understanding and its development.  His book is entirely readable by the average science-minded person.  But, be careful as you read to read between the lines - his omissions of contemporary refutations of conventional dogma."

                "Text": "Yo! Michio... Whachu smokin' booooy?  An'...where can we get some?  Okay, seriously:  this does remind me of those wild late night conversations we used to engage in at university back in the day... typically after too many bong hits. These are some mind-stretching ideas, and yes ancient Hindu (Dravidic?) mystics tried to record all this for us in an earlier iteration. But the language they used in their explanations was perhaps too poetic, too mystical and  too symbolic to survive the centuries and  translation (both language and cross-cultural translation).  A good companion to this book would perhaps be Ervin Laszlo's \"Science and the Akashic Field\" or \"The Whispering Pond\" by the same author. Never-the-less we do owe Kaku (and Laszlo, and others:  Fred Alan Wolf, Michael Talbot?) our gratitude for even attempting to make this bizarre subject  accessible to those of us who have not the benefits of  higher education or mystical experience! A fair amount of \"suspension of disbelief\" is required here. Kaku does this particularly well because he tries to employ \"everyday language.\""
