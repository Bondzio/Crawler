                "Text": "Maxwell used to teach working class people physics (as part of his socialist convictions) at the University of London among other places and these elementary books are a product of those lectures. It must have been surreal to be part of those lectures and learn from the grand master of physics. It is such a great pity that he died at 47. Had he lived, he would easily have crafted The Special Theory of Relativity as well."
