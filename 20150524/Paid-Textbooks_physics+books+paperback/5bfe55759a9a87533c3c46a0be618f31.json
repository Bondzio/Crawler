                "Text": "In understanding the language of Tesla, when not well educated in science, it takes a translator to navigate his writings. Here is a wonderful book. Everyone should learn Tesla's Ether Physics and it should come out of the shadows of the occult (meaning secret) and into free energy products! I'd like to give Tesla's spirit what he intended. Peace. Learn his science and start here!"

                "Text": "Vacuum space possesses a underlying grid structure which can be altered by Ether particles that inhabit it to create the effects of spatial curvature and gravitational fields. The Ether carried with the Earth causes the Lense-Thirring effect.  See also \"Detector of aether operating on transverse Doppler effect\", Hasslberger \"Extended Michelson-Morley Interferometer Experiment\".  This book claims that Tesla harnessed the Ether to build his aircraft.  He controlled his craft by altering the field shape. He probably launched it off a tower. His craft displaced about 5 cubic meters and would be float in the air when its overall weight (including the pilot) was less than 29 lbs (air weighs 1.2 kg/m3).  He claimed that matter moves from high to low density ether. Since the density of ether is lower on earth, he had to create lower ether density to move his craft away from earth. High speed space flight is possible when less opposing ether is transferred THRU the particles of the ship when the ship hits the atmospheric matter (p65). Longitudinal Ether displacement causes G forces. Long ether strands form between low and high dense ether.  He projected some form of energy around his craft to disperse ether leaving uncharged massless particles. Its a fact that anyone from CERN who believes in the Higgs particle will reject this concept because they believe that photons, electrons, and protons inherently have charge without mass.  The author believes that over unity generators are possible due to particle absorption of ether (p14/90). Not all the ether is released when a particle stops due to speed of earth relative to space. Petrovoltaics is caused by the earths acceleration and deceleration relative to ether. Ether moves along the lines of force in electric and magnetic fields and light captures this ether and slows down (p14).  These ideas are also opposed by those that believe that Black Holes trap light with dense Ether. It's an great theory and a good book for those interested in mysteries. Tesla developed geothermal power as an environmentally safer alternative for predatory societies, see Patents US20070175217, US 8,499,563. F=1.2 kg/m3 x 5m3 x 2.2 x 9.81 m/s / 4.448 = 129.49N /4.448= 29 pounds (2.2lb=1kg 1lb=4.448N gravity= 9.81 m/s."

                "Text": "This is a very fascinating book that documents the facts about UFOs. The are two basic myths about UFOs - (1) they do not exist, or (2) if they do exist, they are aliens. However, common sense and scientific evidence disprove these phony lies. This big media has been brainwashing the public about UFOs for quiet some time. This book shows that Nikola Tesla was the inventor of flying saucer technology. However, these facts about UFOs have been deliberately concealed by the media and governments of the world. Every person on earth should read this book. It is highly recommended you also read \"Pentagon Aliens\" which is also written by the same author."
