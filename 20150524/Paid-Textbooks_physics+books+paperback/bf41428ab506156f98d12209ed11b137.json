                "Text": "Very little effort seems to have gone into making this book.  As an AP Physics 1 teacher, I bought a copy to help generate questions for my own class, particularly in new sections like rotational dynamics.  The rotation section does not say a word about rotational kinetic energy, nor does it talk about angular momentum, both of which are on the new exam.  There are also no questions in the section review related to the new material.  I mistakenly recommended this book to my students based on the AP Physics B book, but will be retracting that recommendation tomorrow in class.  Very frustrating!"

The practice exams in the book do not seem to be anything like what the AP board has said will be on the test. The \"Table of Information\" on the included practice exams is nothing like the table that the College Board has published. For the multiple choice parts of the test the instructions say \"Calculators may not be used in this part\". but calculators WILL be allowed on the AP Physics 1 exam. The questions contain way too many computational questions and not many of the conceptual questions that the College Board has promised will be on the AP Physics 1 exam. I didn't give it a 1 because I think the concepts will be helpful but I wouldn't count on getting a 5 because of what the techniques in the book."
