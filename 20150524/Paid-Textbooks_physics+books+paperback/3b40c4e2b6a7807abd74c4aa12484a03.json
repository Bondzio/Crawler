                "Text": "The companion study guide to University Physics is so concise, so boiled-down simple that it can act as a replacement to the textbook in courses with a good professor who delivers detailed lectures and to students who take solid notes in those courses. There aren't any tedious derivations here, just a list of key concepts and formulae followed by sample problems. A crucial homework companion, a more crucial test prep companion."

                "Text": "This is an adequate book. It explains things clearly & has numerous problems. I used it for self study as a refresher & found it below the level that I was looking for. Perhaps if you are totally new to the material then it might be a better choice. Not bad, but I would suggest a more rigorous text if you have any prior exposure to physics."
