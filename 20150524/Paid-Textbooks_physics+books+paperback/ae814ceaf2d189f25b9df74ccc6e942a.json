Amazingly, the author manages to meet his goal of covering the material without a lot of math, and yet does it in an understandable manner, and very readably. He combines degrees in both music composition and physics with a sense of humor that makes the book a joy to read. This book is highly recommended to anyone interested in any aspect of music theory, instrument design, or any related topic."

I've always wanted to know more about how music works and it is as if John could read my thoughts about the questions I've had, and anticipate what I was thinking next and wanted an explanation for. I've never truely inderstood decibels, even after many explanations, until I read this book. The physics of how instruments produce sound is so clear and readable that I now appreciate listening to the differences in them even more. His explanations of \"keys\" and \"major and minor\" and how we percieve them was never explained well in so many other books I've read. I could go on and on, but just want to commend John on his ability to explain complex topics in ways that are easily understood. A must read for music lovers with curiosity!"

                "Text": "I learned the piano when I was a kid and started up again recently. Even though I did some music theory back then, this book is a much more enjoyable and understandable approach to the subject than those old exercise books. My favorite parts were learning about why scales are the way they are, key shifts, and explaining the jargon of classical music. Personally I was less interested in the earlier chapters about how musical sounds are physically generated - we've all seen those diagrams of vibrating strings already. The author's style is readable and friendly, and the accompanying CD is at times helpful. It also makes you feel that composing need not be a fantasy. If you've ever wanted an actual explanation of why we play the notes and keys we do, this is a terrific book."

I was hoping for a slightly more in-depth study of the physics of acoustics, soundwaves, etc., but that's not the book's fault.  It does what I suppose it was intended to do, which simply and basically explain what music is, in terms of physics.  It does that in a fun and good-humored way."

The book requires no prior knowledge of music or music theory, or even how to read music, but it is probably only for those seriously interested in \"how music works.\"  Mr. Powell presents in a clear and humorous book an explanation of just about everything you could imagine concerning the topic of music and music perception.  For example, he gives a brief history of the difficulty in designing musical instruments so that not only do they sound good but allow a transposition from key to key known as \"well tempered.\" (think of Bach's \"Well Tempered Clavier.\") Powell also delves into the psychology of music and sound perception showing us for example, that humans don't perceive loudness linearly - the old Weber-Fechner Law from psycho-physics.  Powell explains why some music sounds sad and some happy and always throughout the books he gives examples from popular to classical works.  I loved this book and plan on using it as a supplement in one of my psychology courses on motivation but as I said at the beginning, I think you really should have a burning curiosity about the working of music to stick with the book even as well written as it is.  But if you do love music and want to really learn more about it, this is a 5-star place to learn."

I say this is a great book if you are new to music -- and I mean that you are new to playing music/instruments.  Music is its own language, and this book is the beginning of how to understand the language. The author explains concepts using everyday language and both familiar and unique examples.  I found his discussion on the harp and the glockenspiel very entertaining and enlightening.  Plus the author has a \"laugh out loud\" sense of humor (yeah, I could have said LOL, but I like words...)  Unless you have studied music theory for many years, I believe that anyone who is a musician or a wanna-be musician like myself, will find this book worth the price and the time."

As a non-musician with an interest in using DAWs such as Reason, Cubase, FL Loops etc for largely empirical compositions I found this book gave me a great insight into some of the fundamentals of music that had eluded me up until now. No, it won't make you a musician just by reading it and competent musicians may find the information somewhat basic, but for the rest of us who love music but never really spoke it's language this is a must read. And Mr. Powell's witty prose never allow it to be boring, even when he's discussing \"fiddly details\"."

As one who has had  to work hard to learn Music Theory in  my retirement, I wish I could have had \"How Music Works\" to guide me.  That he is a physicist, as I am, may have contributed to the ease with which I followed his approach, but I believe his very ingenious Ugly Harp model will work for a wide audience trying to come to grips with chords, scales and intervals. It will appeal especially to singers, who often rub along with a very sketchy understanding of these technicalities, and will enhance their singing pleasure with a deeper understanding of how and why certain phrases and note combinations are so effective.  It's not written like a reference book, but I refer to it regularly."

As a classroom music teacher, I know that's not easy.  While I disagree with some of his more subjective claims and how they are stated as fact -- like how a person develops perfect pitch -- his physics and history lessons are genius, a notable example being his explanation of sound on page 21.  I'm totally using that one in my classroom."

True, there are some brief, end-of-chapter interjections by the author. But it would be helpful to hear examples of the musical concepts being discussed as they are being discussed. I lost interest after a couple of chapters and stopped listening."
