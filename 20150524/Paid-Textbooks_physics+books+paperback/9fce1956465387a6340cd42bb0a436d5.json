The problems and answers in this book do not even go with the text book. Please I write reviews because I found reviews to be helpful when I need to buy merchandise on the internet. DON\u2019T WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK."

I would like to see more problems covered or at least, all the \"starred\" problems covered. The textbook wasn't a great physics book so I expected better examples in the solutions manual. And to the publishers; Please remember that this book is what students use every day as their main teaching source. The 1 hr. a day of in class time does not cut it. Students need to SEE examples clearly before they can become critical thinkers and apply that knowledge."
