                "Text": "Gamow has long be revered as one of the original science \"popularizers\"--mostly because of his lucid and well trimmed writing style. This book is no different and it has the added bonus that Gamow actually knew most of the modern physicists--starting with Einstein--personally. It is worth buying for the great \"kayak problem\" in the relativity chapter alone, but has a wide range of different interesting tidbits, biographical information, and of course physics in Gamow's distinctive way. Well worth a read, especially for only $10."

                "Text": "The book does a wonderful job of mixing the narrative of how certain ideas came to prominence in physics, the people behind them, and the concepts that underlie our current (as of 1988) understanding of the world. It was very enjoyable to read. I read it from back to front just because the more recent theories are more interesting. However, I would suggest that someone less familiar with physics (without an intro. college physics background) not do the same since many of the earlier concepts are useful in understanding the material later on."

                "Text": "I absolutely loved this book. I have never had a formal physics class but have read a lot on the subject and this book really helped to tie up loose ends on things I was questioning. I wouldn't use this book to start with but I would definitely keep it for a third or fourth read in learning physics. Gamow's stories of other physicists also brings a sense of personality to the scientists of the 20th century."
