                "Text": "As both a Star Trek (old series) fan and popular science reader, I was greatly intrigued to see Lawrence Krauss' The Physics of Star Trek at my local bookstore.  Often disappointed by past efforts to connect to the  bandwagon of popular culture, I was delighted at how learned, clear, yet  sprightly Krauss' short book was.  In the first part, Krauss attempts  nothing less than an explanation of Newtonian physics, general and special  relativity, and other physics concepts to explain warp drives, tractor  beams, wormholes, and other Star Trek staples that -- under the laws of  physics as we now understand them -- are probably impossible.  Subsequent  chapters address and deconstruct the transporter beam, warp drive, etc. The  clarity and humor of Krauss' writing is just wonderful. Perhaps the most  amusing chapter is the last, in which Krauss lists his \"top ten\"  Star Trek scientific bloopers -- events, plot devices, and the like that  just could not occur.  Because he is a trekker, Krauss does not treat these  foibles with contempt or ridicule; as a scientist and writer, he ably  outlines those errors."

                "Text": "As I looked through my local bookstore for an interesting read, I could not help but notice this interesting title in the Physics science section.  Being a sporatic viewer of Star Trek myself, I picked it up for a closer look.  As I read the first section of the book, I realized that it was more than blatant critique on scientific errors.  Rather, it was an interesting view of future possibilities and also impossibilities in the field of science.  In this book, Krauss explores the existence of things such as wormholes, black holes, and existence of other intelligent life in space.  Krauss is also relentless in his discussion of Einstein and other renowned Physicists.  He often writes about highly esoteric subject matter, but on the whole this book is well rounded and a relatively interesting read.  However, keep in mind that one must have an interest in science, specifically fields such as quantum mechanics and relativity."

Laurence Krauss shows that it is possible to enjoy \"Trek\" while using it as a tool to teach some physics fundamentals (usually to the effect that \"Trek\" physics/technology is impossible or wildly improbable). The foreword is by Stephen Hawking, also a fan, who endorses the imagination-expanding possibilities of science fiction. Remember how many engineers were inspired by the example of the late \"Scotty\" (he was even given an honorary engineering doctorate for it). Read, and enjoy - and learn more about the awesome universe in which we live."

                "Text": "I'm sure some 'true blue' Star Trek fans will be disappointed that this book doesn't agree with all the 'science' used in Star Trek.  Actually 'Star Trek' is only used as a jumping off point to talk about physics and possible advances of physics in the future.  It also presents the other side, and will give the scientific reasons that some form of Star Trek technology (such as transporters) will probably never be possible.  I thought the explanation of various scientific principles (usually related to something in Star Trek) were done well without being either condenscending or obtuse.  I was actually surprised that the author (apparently a Start Trek fan) found that, for the most part, the scientific concepts used in Start Trek were generally more accurate than the usual SF TV show or movie.  Usually the science in these shows is pretty bad.  It appears that the Star Trek technical advisors have been doing their homework.  I recommend this book to those interested in science and physics and are also familiar with Star Trek.  The connection between the two makes the science more palatable and enjoyable."

I assume it is physics in relatively simple terms, given that I could  understand most of it, but I feel like a scientist now (did you know that  quarks come in three colors?).  Its the same idea as A Brief History of  Time but easier to understand.  Recommended for any curious resident of our  universe."

The writer does spend alot of the book on nitpicking about details the Star Trek writers got wrong, but I neither like or dislike this.  To his credit, the author does tell of many of the innovations that the Star Trek show led to, and also tells of the particles/concepts that they somehow got right before researchers discovered them.  The shortcoming is the closedmindedness.  All through the book he tells of the impossible energy requirements to accomplish many things, such as warpspeed, but they're only impossible according to current knowledge.  Go back to BC times and ask their scientists about flying machines: impossible.  But the book is still filled with great technical details that'll keep any avid Hawking readers on their toes, and is still interesting to the \"lay\" reader."

                "Text": "It is not often a cultural phenomenon like Star Trek is responsible for a spurt of growth of interest in the hard sciences that serve as a backdrop for the various television shows and movies in its canon.  Lawrence Krauss in THE PHYSICS OF STAR TREK attempts to confront the unspoken assumptions that go on in the viewer's mind under the helm's countertop when Captain Kirk orders, 'Warp factor three, Mr. Sulu.'  Apparently what goes on in reality is the merging of pseudo-science with some very clever writing that distracts an audience that is not particularly science-literate anyway. Krauss discusses the widespread Star Trek use of holograms, warp travel, matter transportation, phasers, inertial dampers, time travel, and nano-technology.  In each case, he points out with some tongue in cheek the present impossibility of actually developing and using such devices.  Krauss is a physicist who likes to write,or judging by his lengthy list of published books, he is a writer who likes physics.  He has a smooth style of explaining the grotesquely unfamiliar in terms of the beloved familiar world of the Federation.  TPST is a book written for those whose knowledge of basic science is gleaned from watching shows like Star Trek.  He asks many questions, elaborates many details, but provides precious few answers.  In short, he is just like my 10th grade physics teacher.  Perhaps that is the inner lesson of this book: to probe beneath the smoke and mirrors of the writer-magician's blanket to see if the immutable laws of reasonability are being obeyed."

Soliton waves?  I had no idea.  I do have an idea for the Undiscoverable Country chapter, though.  I just got finished watching the Voyager episode \"The Gift\" and I noticed something at the end.  Somehow, Kes propels the ship 9,500 light years in a matter of seconds. I didn't do any calculations-the show just got finished-but I'm pretty sure that that is faster than Warp 10, which the Voyager series already proved was almost impossible in a shuttlecraft, let alone a full-sized starship.  That brings me to something else that Dr. Krauss can add.  It isn't really a physics problem, but more of a continuity error one of my relatives informed me of.  As I have already stated, Voyager has proved the impossibility of travel over Warp 10, but in more than one episode of ST:TOS and ST:TNG, ships have gone over Warp 10.  I believe Dr. Krauss noted one such episode in his book, but I would just like to say that there are many more."

I think it's clear that Krauss loves and knows his Star Trek as much as he does his scientific research, and his purpose in writing this book must have been both to educate and to entertain, and I think he scores big on both counts.  Plus, the forward by Stephen Hawking, and the references to Hawking's poker game with Data, Newton, and Einstein, sets a fun tone right from the start.  I think there is no way you can read this book and not learn something you didn't know before, or think about something you knew in a different way, I don't care how much of a Trek fan you are.  And there is no way you can not have fun reading this book.  A must read for all Trek fans!"

The Physics of Star Trek, brilliantly written by Lawrence M. Krauss, provides an educated look into the reality of concepts Star Trek writers incorporated into the series. Krauss illustrates that vast impossibilities exist due to the constraints of the laws of physics. Krauss takes many advanced ideas that have been developed in physics and explains them so that average people can grasp their complex principles. This is an interesting read for anyone who wants to better understand how our universe operates. I suggest that any Trekker out there, anyone who gazes into the stars at night and wonders if others are out there, or anyone who just loves to have their brain expanded by the intrigue of the vast universe read this book!!"

There is a  lot of explanation for people who are not familiar with the physics topics  covered, like me.  There are two problems though:  1) Warp drive is  discussed without mention of the involvement of subspace.  My impression is  that warp drive could not exist without subspace.  2) Nothing about force  fields, on which the holodeck relies to give its holographic objects more  realism.  So if you know a lot about physics already you will probably be a  little bored, but if not, judging by my experience, you will find it  fascinating.  Just do not treat the author's explanations of Starfleet  technology as necessarily the way it actually works, because this is  definitely not authorized by the makers of Star Trek."

I've found, in my years of nerd and geekdom, and in attending many COMICONS, Star Trek fans seem to be the more scientifically-oriented of the two camps (Star Wars vs Star Trek). So, I think this book will appeal to ST fans perhaps even more than Cavelos' book did to SW fans. Now, both books have been out for some time. In fact, I picked up both of them on Amazon in 2005, but, this is another book that I find myself returning to from time to time as it's truly that fun and interesting a read. Grab a copy today, if you're a Star Trek fan, you definitely will not be disappointed."

The entire time it keeps you intrigued and open-minded about the possibility of space travel,  wormholes, and the like.  Initially I had no idea how in depth the Star Trek writers went when creating the series.  Each possibility was addressed and backed up by facts and theories of some of the smartest minds our current physics world has ever seen.  This book truly gives insight into the physics of Star Trek, as the name portrays.  I would recommend this book to anyone and it is interesting the whole way through.  After reading The Physics of Star Trek, I was truly curious about Newton, Einstein, and Hawking's work toward time travel and all science fiction related to Star Trek.  The examples given by Krauss are very helpful in understanding how all of this was thought out and expertly wrapped up in this book, in a relatable and comical way, as well.  It is easy to read also, anyone can just pick up this book and read it the whole way through.  The Physics of Star Trek really shows how possible the science is or could be in the potentially near future.  This book is a great introduction to physics in general and provides a good foundation for the fundamentals of astrology.  Overall it's a fun and exciting read."

Every iteration of Star Trek from the \"classic\" first series up to Deep Space Nine is addressed in this very readable book.  This is not a snotty ivory-tower \"Comic Book Guy\" treatment:  the author makes very clear his respect for the series, and the fact the shows do get some things right.  Dr. Kraus takes the reader from warp drives, and phasers to the transporter and cloaking devices, with some time travel thrown in.  His explanations of special and general relativity are, I think, some of the best in print.  (They even drove me to dig out my copy of \"The Meaning of Relativity\" by Einstein-which I quickly put back on the shelf realizing there was a time I actually could follow the equations...)  The bottom line is while some of the technology is theoretically possible i.e. warp drives, just ain't no way Scotty's ever going to/did? Beam anybody anywhere.  The material is written in such an approachable way, that this would make a great supplement text for a high-school physics or calculus class.  Highly recommended-even if you're not a Star Trek fan."

Whether you are a fan of Star Trek or have no idea what Star Trek is, whether you like science or think it is all meaningless and boring. If you are a big fan you will love this book because he goes into great detail about individual episodes all the way from Captain Kirk to Captain Archer. The book talks about certain incidences in some of the episodes that not even I can remember and I have seen every episode. If you have no idea what Star Trek is this book will still be one of the best books I think you will ever read. It is very interesting! Talks about how everything you see on T.V. is different than from real life. How you look at one thing on earth and it will read 2+2=4 but then you look at that same thing in space and it will read 2+2=5 everything in space is completely different and this book has the best examples that I have ever seen. I highly suggest that everyone reads this book. Whether you  are a fan of Star Trek or not."

                "Text": "Fascinating review of how the science and technology of the fictional 24th Century of Star Trek compares to current scientific theory.  From warp engines to wormholes, from teleportation to tractor beam's, Dr. Lawrence Krauss explains how these marvels might and might not(!!) work within the constraints of the universe as we understand them today.  Dr. Krauss credits Star Trek's writers not only with getting much of their science right (at least in theory) but also with frequently making up terminology which is prescience in its accuracy. (Who would have thought that \"anyons\" really exist.)  In addition to pointing out the most egregious of the gaffes like sound waves in space and the subtle problems of quantum theory, Dr. Krauss also enumerates the mind-boggling magnitudes of energy that warping space and beaming folks around would consume.  All in all a quick, fun read, especially for the \"hard\" science fiction fan"

                "Text": "Although the author is great at stating on how impossilbe it is to do  things like warp drive and transporters, according to relativity and  quantum mechanics, the author knows nothing of the physics of star trek.  His interpretation of how warp drive works for instance is not even close  to how it really works.  And all his assumptions on the technology is using  modern day physics, which is portrayed by the author as the absolute truth  to the universe.  500 years ago it was impossible to circumnavigate the  earth, 50 it was the sound barrier, I suprise a scientist would say that  anything(such as warp drive) is impossible no matter what improvement in  physics.  If you want a book on physics, get a brief history of time, if  you want a book on star trek get the tech manual, just don't get this book  for either."
