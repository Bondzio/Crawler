                "Text": "Both books on mechanics of materials by Den Hartog are remarkable. All the  questions have answers, the writing is clear and to the point. In this  book, he gives the method of Myosotis to calculate the deflections of  beams. Although such material is outdated, it does illustrate an elegant  way of solving beam deflection problems. Today, many problems are being  solved by brute-force computer methods. (Just make an FE mesh!!) Read this  book even though it will not teach you anything new, if only like a novel."

                "Text": "This is the best book on mechanics of materials I have come across. Much more mathematical rigor than similar books by Gere and others. I read this book as an undergraduate and it put me at the top of the class. Of particular note is the Myosotis Method in the section on deflection of beams. This extremely useful method is very powerful, and has been abondonded in most new books becuase of computer software now available. Also has the best treatment of Castigliano Theorem. This book is a must have for any engineer concerned with materials. If your looking for a more advanced book, Advanced Strength of Materials, by the same offer is also very good, but outdated. It does have a very good treatment of shell theory. Better than a good amount of the books on theoretical elasticity that I own. Simply; good author; good book."
