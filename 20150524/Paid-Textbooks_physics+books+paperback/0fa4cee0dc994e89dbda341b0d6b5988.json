                "Text": "Do not buy this thinking that you're going to get anywhere near even half of the problems out of the book it pairs with. The problems that it does contain are worked out with some explanation. This will not help you learn how to do problems that are not in the book as each problem is very different from the last. Honestly though, any help is better than none so I probably would still buy this book again even though it's not very useful."
