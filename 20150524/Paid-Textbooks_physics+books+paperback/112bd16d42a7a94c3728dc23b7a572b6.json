                "Text": "I am a high school physics teacher, and I use this very workbook and have for years.  I have a degree in physics, yet when I first saw this book I would flip through it and say, \"oh, so that's what that means!\"  I could do the math, but I didn't really have a deep understanding.  Why?  Because I didn't have to -- tests only required me to remember the steps and equations.  What a shame.  In other words this book and, indeed the entire Concpetual Physics curriculum, helped me form a better and deeper understanding of the laws of physics."
