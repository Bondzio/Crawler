                "Text": "If you have even the slightest interest in theoretical physics, astronomy, or cosmology, READ THIS BOOK.  Michio Kaku continues with \"Beyond Einstein\" in the proud tradition of its predecessor,  \"Hyperspace;\" I read it as a sophomore in high school and  couldn't put it down, and \"Beyond Einstein\" was no different.  No  prior knowledge of physics or mathematics is assumed; all you need is  curiosity about how the world around you works.  It is well-written and  easy to understand, with just enough history to set the reader up for the  science.  This book will absolutely DAZZLE YOU!"

                "Text": "This isn't Kaku's best book-its one of his earlier efforts and his writing skills have gotten quite a bit better since then. However I still recommend this book. At the time I read it, I was studying electrical engineering in college and one day I ran into a friend in the student union. He started talking about all this physics stuff he was reading and how it was blowing his mind. It was like he had been through a religious conversion. He promised to let me borrow the book and it was Kaku's Beyond Einstein. A very easy read, Kaku got me hooked on physics right away, exposing me to ideas like extra dimensions and grand unified theories of particle physics I had never heard of in my engineering studies. He follows the standard historical treatment, talking about Maxwell, Einstein and the development of quantum mechanics. While it is a bit \"breezy\", its thoroughly enjoyable reading filled with historical antecdotes and nice descriptions of Einsteins spacetime warps. Then after the big bang he heads into his favorite topic, talking about extra dimensions and string theory. I was so hooked by this I began buying up every pop physics book I could find and soon changed my major from electrical engineering to math/physics. After reading Kaku engineering actually seemed mundane. Anyway, like I said this isn't Kaku's best book because his writing style has matured and he writes a lot better now. But the book is a gem that I recommend to those interested in science."

                "Text": "Although not as well written as, 'Hyperspace,' Michio Kaku has put complicated aspects and terms of cosmology and quests for unified field theories into a simple, easy to follow book by using many similies and  metaphores.  The book totally avoided explaining the concept of superstring  theory, but instead it gave a lot of information that lead up to it.  Nevertheless,  I thoroughly enjoyed reading Dr. Kaku's new book because it  gave lots of information about different theories that lead to superstring  theory, such as: special relativity, general relativity, Maxwells theories,  Newtons theories etc.  The book also grasped the concept of understanding  the beginning of the universe before and after the big bang, although not  going into it in much scientifical detail.  However, the big bang is  totally theoretical and hard, infact impossible to explain omnisciently.  The book has some diagrams; resultingly, making the comprehension of some  ideas much easier.  Dr. Kaku is indeed capable of better work, (not that  this isn't good) he is by far one of the best autors of the understanding  of space, in my opinion the only better autor is Steven Hawking himself.  Dr. Kaku is an inspirational role model to me and I hope others agree. His  books can be read by anyone from elementary school students to top  physicicists, due to the simplification of the terms of thought.  The only  people that I don't recomend this book to are the people totally interested  in the science and detailed decriptions of superstring theory.  Otherwise a  Must to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

                "Text": "This fascinating book will take you through the realm of cosmology, physics, and the world of mathematics.  However, the book at times can be hard to understand because it uses very hard language and refers to several theories and scientist.  It is necessary to have small background knowledge in physics and in many of the scientists and theories the book mentions.  It mentions scientist such as Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Hawkins, Newton, Maxwell, Feynman, Glashow, Nambu, and many more.  The book mainly talks about the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics; however, it does mention several other theories too.  It talks about Quantum Mechanics and Einstein's theories in detail; therefore, those theories are easy to follow.  Nevertheless, once the book starts talking about all the theories that came in response to Quantum Mechanics and the Grand Unifying Theory the book becomes hard to follow.  This book tells the history of how several theories have evolved and are being developed to create one theory that unites the four fundamental forces of the world.  The four fundamental forces are electromagnetism, gravity, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.  All these forces are very different, however, with the Superstring Theory; all these forces will be unified.  I recommend this book because it will change you perception of the universe all everything that is around us.  It will baffle your mind with new ideas that seem to be science fiction, yet are somewhat true.  This book is also a great book to learn the basis of the theory of Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and many more astonishing theories that have shaped the way we view space, time, and the world."

                "Text": "While I take a profound, almost religious, satisfaction in physics, especially the more exotic concepts of relativity and quantum theory, I have not the math-physics type of mind that my friend Steve Smith has--lucky fellow.  I found this book readable enough, though, because it doesn't belabor the math side of physics, nor is it one long list of arcane physics formulae. It is still a little more advanced in places than I was fully able to appreciate, but I do enjoy the mental exercise that this kind of a challenge provides.  I had heard of the Superstring theory when it first arose, but I did not take the time then to find out much about it.  It took Steve's intervention to bring it again to my attention, and this book seemed a good place to start.  As a person with an interest in history, especially the history of science, I found the background data on the individual physicists responsible for the various components of the Big Bang Theory and of the Superstring theory of especial interest.  It certainly made the acheivements of these people more human to me and therefore more wonderful.  It also helped me put together, at least at my rudimentary level of understanding, the thought processes that went into making each advance, much as the works of Australian physicist Paul Davis' books do.  Both have a facility for taking the average person through the processes in constructing and testing a theory of the universe.  With each step forward presented by the author, the theory made a little more sense.  I thoroughly enjoyed the learning expereince and plan on reading some of the other books by the same author."

                "Text": "I have read a number of books at this point on grand unification and theory of everything.  This book in particular deals with superstrings as a means by which to unify the physical forces.  From a personal standpoint I do not like superstring theory as the answer to grand cosmological problems.  The readability is also poor and the writing is disjointed.  Last, I prefer the works of Martin Rees and Kip Thorne to Kaku.  Again this book is very disjointed and does not even present superstrings all that well.  Spend your money elsewhere, on the afformentioned authors, or check out some Feynman books if it is unified force type of stuff."

                "Text": "As a previous reader of Michio Kaku's work, I admit to coming in with quite high expectations. Mr. Kaku and his co-author, in this work, do not settle on a thesis or an overarching theme to the book and it suffers from a lack of direction. Often the book is fascinating in it's discussion, but the descriptions of physics processes is often weak and hard to connect and the use of much too many acronyms slows the reading by forcing the reader to check back much too often. My joy in reading this book was certainly dampened by the fact that I read it in too many sittings. Mr. Kaku's work, when read at it's optimum, is read in as few sittings as possible. If you have an afternoon to devote to this book you will wean a great deal of knowledge - and I certainly recommend it as an introduction to a study of the history of the search for deeper knowledge in particle physics. If you are, as I am, an avid reader and fan of all types of work on theoretical and particle physics, you may find this book too bogged down and somewhat lifeless."

I was surprised to learn more about the rest of physics than I did about superstrings!  The book does not  throw a bunch of meaningless equations at us that the layperson has no  chance of understanding.  Instead, we are given a breif, concise history of  atomic physics and shown how string theory fits into that as a logical next  step.  While I was a little dissappointed that there wasn't more  information on superstrings, I found this to be an excellent read and a  very quotable book.

This seems the common approach in this tight genre.  Some explanations were dead-on, while others missed the mark.  All these books seem to lack the will to judge the merits of the Copenhagen Canon, which today seems as \"untenable\" as Einstein's \"localism\".  I could not help challenging several key assumptions leading to the \"inevitable\" conclusions in mainstream theory, assumptions which were stated almost as facts in my own college quantum courses.  It is true; those working on the theories are so caught up in the math, they are not equipped to think visually, as did Einstein.  Now that we've gone beyond dear Albert, isn't it time we go back and pay him a visit?"

Many concepts are explored both through diagrams and words which aids all types of learners in getting the full benefit of the piece.
