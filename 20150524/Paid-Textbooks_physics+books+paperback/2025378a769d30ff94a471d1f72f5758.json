My teacher has a very thick accent, so I sit through her lectures pretty unaware of what she's discussing. The set-up of the study guide isn't very helpful at all."

It doesn't cover as much material as I hoped it would, and unfortunately for me some of the finer points I hoped were covered weren't even mentioned, but it gets 2 stars because it does a few questions and shows how to do them step by step."
