                "Text": "Seems like this edition was rushed.  The book leaves out important details - which are always being filled by the instructor.  It does a good job on some of the concepts, but some topics could use more clarification and maybe examples.  The answers in the back of the book are wrong quite a bit of the time as well and simply use answers from older versions with different problems.  Guys, this is a tough class without dealing with book errors.  But with so many I'm often left guessing...not where I need to be in a class like this.  I like that plenty of practice is provided, but with so many wrong book answers, I'm not sure it isn't working against me."
