For $40 I think this is a ripoff. This book wont help the student who need to practice more from exercises, it doesn't really help at all."

Well, this book is just an abbreviated study tool.  Chegg.com is a much better resource for help with the accompanying physics book.  Don't buy this. I have opened it twice all semester.  It is a waste of your money."

No it doesn't, but it does have some of them and more importantly it gives an overview of the chapter concepts in easier to understand laymans terms. Is it easy to understand? No, it's easier. It's still physics so don't expect anything to be easy and don't expect the book to do your homework for you. 5 stars because it did help me pass the class."
