                "Text": "This small paperback is an excellent book for teaching Physics to young children. Filled with simple experiements that exemplify the principles of Physics, it is an easy guide for parents and children through the physical world. I highly recommend it as a very complete course for elementary children who are home schooled or for those who enjoy learning through experimentation."

                "Text": "Too often, physics students learn to rely on mathematical formulae without really understanding what is happening.  Muriel Mandell's little gem offers a set of deceptively simple experiments for helping young students build basic skills and intuition which are so necessary for later studies.  You'll need only household items to do all the experimentation described here.  Use this book as a starting point for discussions of Newton's Laws of Motion; the relationship between pressure, temperature, and volume; states of matter; and more.  Highly recommended."
