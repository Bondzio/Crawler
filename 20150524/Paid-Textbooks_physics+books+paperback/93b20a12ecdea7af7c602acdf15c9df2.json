To be clear this is not a collection of definitive answers but instead ruminations from various academics on how the two mysteries of QM and Mind might be related (or not related as one essay leans toward)."

                "Text": "Written by people who don't know what they are talking about. Couple of articles are OK and present conjectures of physicists and at least are clearly labelled as pure speculations. A few more are written by psychologists and philosophers who totally don't understand quantum physics and abuse seriously looking but irrelevant physics terminology and equations. Majority of the articles are written by mystics who have found confirmation of extrasensory perception, paranormal phenomena and ancient Indian philosophies in what they think is quantum physics. Full of brilliant logic like \"if prayer did not produce some positive results, it is likely that religion would have abandoned it centuries ago\" and deep thoughts like  \"by knowing what it isn't, consciousness may know what it is not\". Total waste of time."
