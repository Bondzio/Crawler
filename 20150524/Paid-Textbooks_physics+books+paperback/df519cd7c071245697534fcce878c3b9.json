These are without a doubt the most helpful books I have ever read on basic electrical theory. Each topic is clearly and concisely explained and forms a building block for further topics in the series. These books form the foundation of knowledge I use in everyday real world applications. The authors explain each principle with reference to real world examples to allow the reader to relate what they have read to what they have seen."

Since it was first published in 1954, you may find the illustrations and graphics (did they have \"graphics\" in 1954?) a bit dated.  On the other hand, I think they help explain the concepts very well."

All I have to say is that the direction of current flow shown in the diagrams is either wrong, or varies widely between conventional and electron theory. For example, on page I-41 they show electron theory current flow from a battery through a lamp in the right direction (negative to positive), but then later in the section discussing Ammeters pages I-95 through I-104 they consistently show current flow going in the WRONG DIRECTION. Obviously the person who did the diagrams was confused and no one did a good job checking their work. This is the kind of thing that is terribly confusing for a person trying to learn \"BASIC ELECTRICITY\" and is just plain sloppy. I want my money back!!!"
