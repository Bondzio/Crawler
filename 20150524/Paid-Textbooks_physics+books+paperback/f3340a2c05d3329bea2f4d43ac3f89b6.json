                "Text": "Carnot's forgotten masterpiece, Clapeyron's memoir that enabled Kelvin and Clausius to rediscover it, and Clausius' milestone work that put thermodynamics on a solid scientific foundation. For those studying classical thermodynamics or the history of science, this is an indispensible book. Carnot's posthumous notes (a fascinating insight into the man's genius) and Eric Mendoza's finely written introduction add further to its timeless appeal."
