                "Text": "This is an interesting introduction  to a wide swath of modern mathematics using the history of astronomy and mechanics (in modern ideas and notation) as the vehicle. I am a bit prejudiced since I was in Taliaferro's last time through the class in 1971-72. His class and his advising had a permanent impact on me, leading me to a PhD in mathematics and years of teaching, as well as sparking my interest in the history of mathematics which became my research interest. I can still hear his voice as I read the book. I wonder if the problem sets and exams can be made available on a website?"
