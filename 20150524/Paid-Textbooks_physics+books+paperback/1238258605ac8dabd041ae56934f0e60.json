                "Text": "This book will cover everything you really need to know. Some chapters probably could do with a little more examples and explaining, but this is the book to get if you're going to get just one. The AP Exam is a whole lot worse than the grade you will probably end up getting in July. Most of my class felt they completely bombed the test but ended up making 4's and 5's. I took this my senior year and constantly found myself getting behind because of laziness and lack of motivation (senior year). I desperately crammed for about a week before the exam and I felt like I was learning a year's worth of information in that time. I did my best on the exam and ended up getting a 5 and a 4. As long as you know the basic concepts and have the ability to do most of the well known examples, you will be competent."

The only problem was that some of the pages were blurred or smeared. It made it difficult to understand some of the topics because of that but overall, it's a great buy if you want a good rundown of mechanics and electricity and magnetism."

Although it could have certainly used a little more explaining/detail on some of the proofs, it definitely reviewed nearly everything that was necessary (specific Gaussian surfaces/Amperian surfaces/charge distributions/magnetic field distributions) for E&M.; The other books barely go into detail for E&M; at all. Mechanics was also sufficiently covered, but I think Tension and Angular Concepts/Rotational Inertia could've went further into detail as most Free Response Questions are on either one or both every year."
