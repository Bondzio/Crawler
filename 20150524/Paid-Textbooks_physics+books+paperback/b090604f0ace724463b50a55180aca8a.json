Physics for Gearheads is such a book. If you ever wanted to get a better understanding of the forces that come into play when driving, turning, braking and racing your Corvette, this is indeed the book for you!"

                "Text": "I am very impressed with this Randy's new book. This is a book that is greatly needed in the automotive industry. I encourage my engineering students to take as many physics courses as they can, but many physics teachers make physics a dull and uninteresting topic. This book could change all that. I would like to see our physics department adopt this book as text. I commend the author for a great book that could really get automotive engineering students interested in physics."
