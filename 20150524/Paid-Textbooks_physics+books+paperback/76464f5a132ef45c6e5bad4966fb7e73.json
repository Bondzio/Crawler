                "Text": "IT basically serves its purpose for my second physics course. What is weird is that the table of contents gives the contents of volume 1 and volume 2, so that is a little confusing, and the page numbers start off where volume 1 left off, but that doesn't bother me. The examples in the book are good, and it's lightweight because of the softcover that I don't break my back going to class."
