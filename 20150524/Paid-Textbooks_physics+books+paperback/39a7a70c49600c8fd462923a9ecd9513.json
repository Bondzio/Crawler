                "Text": "You must have a working understanding of physics to do many of these problems.  I guess that is the idea.  I suppose I expected it to teach as it went but it does not.  If you know physics already you might enjoy this.  If not, you will need a physics reference book to complete these problems.  I really wanted to like this but ended up returning it.  I don't think it will be \"relaxing,\" for the high school student for whom I had intended it."
