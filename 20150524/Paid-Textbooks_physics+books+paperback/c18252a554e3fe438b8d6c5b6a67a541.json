Pass all exams related to the topice accordingly. The book is not very thick, but well printed and is written in clear and consistent language. Bravo!"

                "Text": "I am using these book in a physics class in college and while it is very helpful and good at explaining concepts, there are very few worked out problem which makes it very hard to apply the material. Also, the publisher will not give teachers permission to post the answers in the book so there is no way to check if you did the practice problems right. Overall I would not recommend this as the primary book for a physics course."

However i did feel that the book was kind of basic, and that could have elaborated a bit more on the subject of general relativity. This book is probably better suited for a highschool AP course than a college course. But then again I'm probably too strict when judging course materials..."
