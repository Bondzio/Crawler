                "Text": "I wish I had these books at the start of college! Feynman has an explicit way of making a difficult subject perfectly clear. He uses parallels, meaning he will use common every day objects to explain physics problem. Then, he will apply the actual physics. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves and enjoys physics."

If you can read it before the semester begins I would recommend it, because I haven't been able to read the whole thing but I've loved what I've read so far!"
