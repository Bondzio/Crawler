                "Text": "Enjoyed \u201cThe Physics of Pitching\u2019 and know first-hand the experience (8+ years in Major League Baseball...he's been there!) and scientific knowledge Rusty Meacham puts forth in his instructional sessions. Being a 15+year college instructor myself in the sciences, and former player, I\u2019ve observed Rusty\u2019s baseball/pitching instructional style and content with student players at many local baseball clinics. I can attest to Rusty\u2019s expertise as a pitching instructor and overall baseball mentor to young baseball players\u2026.Sincerely, Frederick F.

If your son or daughter pitch baseball at any level I highly recommend that you get this book and read it to yourself and then have them read it. This man is a wealth of knowledge and he knows how to reach younger pictures as well has older ones."

The information in this book is easily applied to any young pitcher. Many thanks to Rusty for sharing his knowledge to those of us who don`t have his experience or talent."
