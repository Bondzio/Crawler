While this student manual contains actual explanations of the solutions, the actual amount of explanations leaves much to be desired.  Only every 4-6 odd questions are actually given.  For those expecting a consistent homework helper, this is probably not a decent investment.  If all you want are decent examples of how to tackle certain types of problems, this is probably for you."
