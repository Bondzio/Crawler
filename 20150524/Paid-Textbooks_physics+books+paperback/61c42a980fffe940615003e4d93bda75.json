It requires no calculus, and it reviews the laws that you will cover in an introductory physics class. He writes it in a very clear, understandable, and sometimes humorous way. I passed the exam to skip the first (algebra-based) physics class, to go straight into the calculus-based physics. That's what I needed from the book and it delivered."

The exercises were practical and easy for the students to understand. I really like the relationship between the books and the workbook. This has been really useful for my students."

This gave an overview but went far more into the mathematical explanation of vectors than I wanted or needed.

I suppose that was the purpose of this book, but it was just more than I needed. If you want the mathematical equations and explanations, this is fine, but if you just want a basic overview without getting bogged down with the math, you may want to keep looking."
