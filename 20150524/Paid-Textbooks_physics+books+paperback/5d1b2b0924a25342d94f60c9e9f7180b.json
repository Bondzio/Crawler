I think I'm being generous with the stars actually - less than half the solutions are present.  Yeah, more than half the odd numbered solutions are provided, but I'd still like to see more."

More importantly, NONE OF THE CHALLENGE PROBLEMS ARE INCLUDED, making this an absolutely useless volume. The only reason someone would buy a solutions manual would be for a walk-through of the more difficult problems."
