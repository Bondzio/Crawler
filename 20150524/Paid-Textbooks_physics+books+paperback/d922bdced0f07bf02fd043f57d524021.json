                "Text": "It's been over 20 years since I've had any physics, but I still enjoyed the riddles and questions in this book -- sure, some were over my head, but I still could understand lots of the explanations.  Plus, the examples are practical enough to make you the star of your next party:  is it better (which will make it COOL faster) to let black coffee cool first and then put in cold milk or to put cold milk in and let it cool?  Coffee drinkers will be happy to know that black coffee cools faster than white so wait a few minutes before pouring your cold milk in if you want it to cool quickly.  If you like these kinds of brainteasers, you'll love this book.  An appropriate gift for students and pondering adults alike.  The authors also provide interesting quotes in the margins that make for good reading as well.  Some of the explanations are a bit too brief if you really want to understand the physics behind it, but the authors provide the reader with enough information to dig deeper. Fun!"

The problems are presented clearly and the solutions are fairly thoroughly explained if you take the time to read through them.  This book is a fun and great way to review and apply your scientific knowledge or learn new things!  There are entertaining quotations in the columns as fun distractions.  Interspersed among the short problems/scenarios are diagrams if the situation needs to be described graphically."
