                "Text": "Ehh, yeah, it only has select problems from each chapter. I suppose the argument could be made that if it had all the odd problems then students could just use that for their answers. Well, I kind of feel that is the students prerogative to be lazy and not really learn the material. The test will come back to haunt them, or they will be seen as incompetent by future employers. As for me, I'm not innately smart so like a zillion problems. I do them honestly, and I would like to ensure I did them right for my own understanding. So I'm a bit disappointed."
