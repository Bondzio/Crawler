The principles and examples are clearly delineated. There are margin notes from the authors. Suggestions for what math you need for certain sections. Biographies of major players in thermal physics. And suggestions for further reading for some chapters."

                "Text": "I would rate this one of the better undergraduate physics books. Why? Because it most effectively teaches and stresses the important physics behind thermodynamics; this is something that most textbooks don't do. Once the physics are learnt and deeply understood, going up to higher level books is easy. Having said that, the book could be improved by the authors having given more (at least 2x as many) questions as they have in the current book."
