                "Text": "Gene Kranz provides the reader with a remarkably vivid account of what it is like to be behind the scenes of Mission Control.  From the initial procedures he wrote for the Mercury program, to the clipped voices of  controllers working a spacecraft contingency to the sometimes abandoned way  they let off steam off-console, Mr. Kranz brings you an accurate and very  readable account of the MCC.  From my own experiences of 20 years in the  MCC, this book provides a very personal glimpse in how we continue to work.  For the reader who remembers growing up with the highs and lows of the  space race, this book will rekindle all the emotions of the time and fill  in many of the blanks that can only come from an insider such as Mr. Kranz.  \"Failure Is Not An Option\" should be required reading for any  one currently working at the MCC, and for anyone wanting to learn more  about what it took to put a man on the moon."

                "Text": "Failure is not an option is not for your average folk.  I seriously doubt  that the average person on the street could make it from beginning to end.  However, if you are a space-nut, or just are really yearning for the good  'ole days of Apollo, then you can't go wrong with this book.  I've read  just about every book every written on the Apollo program, and while the  astronauts' books are much more interesting than Gene Kranz's,  \"Failure is not an option\" will not disappoint.  Mr. Kranz allows  us into a very private part of the space program.  Most people know the  stories of the astronauts because we've been allowed, through a free  society, to witness every step they have taken.  However, there were never  very many stories told about Mission Control during that era.  After you  finish this book, you'll start to realize that the astronauts had it easy!  Most of the more mundane details are left out of his book, but Mr. Krantz  slows things down during the first lunar landing, describing every detail  he could remember.  The entire book is extremely exciting and you won't  believe the career of Gene when you are done.  He was definitely at the  right place at the right time to have one of the most spectacular careers  possible.  I bet he looks back now-a-days and wishes things had happened a  bit more slowly for him to appreciate it more.  He did so much in such a  little time.  This book is a must-have for any space-enthusiast, but will  probably get a bit slow for anyone else.  Thank you Gene!  Now, when is  Chris Kraft's book coming out?"

                "Text": "A fairly good description of the manned space program up to the end of Apollo from the Mission Control side, this book still leaves the reader wanting greater perspective on the overall effort to reach the Moon.  Yes,  the writing is unpolished, but the style does capture the man who played a  critical role in the early years of the NASA Mission Control--Gene Kranz is  a true American original.  There is little new material here, but there are  a few interesting anecdotes.  More discussion of the post-Apollo era would  have made this book a much better tome.  Furthermore, some of the criticism  of NASA today is a bit off base.  The NASA of today is a much different  place than the one Kranz was a part of in the Cold War era, and warrants a  different vision than the space agency of 30 years ago.  I enjoyed this  book, and recommend it for space buffs.  A better book for the casual  reader, however, is probably \"Moonshot\" by Deke Slayton and Alan  Shepard."

                "Text": "Gene Kranz is one of those people \"who were there\" and helped to write the history. That itself is the reason why to read this book and it is a must for all of you who are interested in history of the space program. The book covers the Mercury to Apollo period of US space program during which Kranz served as a flight director. I expected more of a technical insight into NASA mission control business of that era but - and here comes the important part - the limited portion of technical details is compensated more than sufficently by expression of the passion shared by all people involved in the program at that time. Truth of the matter is, that passion was (due to my opinion) the most important thing on America's ladder to the Moon. It is very inspiring book, sometimes I felt the goosebumps when I realized how much is this passion missing in today's world. Although it is a clich\u00e9, when I was reading this book I had to ask \"where the world could be, if all the people think and work in the same way as those Americans did back in that time\". So, read it. Probably you won't become an expert on 50's and 60's mission control but you will have a lot to think about. For me, it is a mark of a really good book."

                "Text": "I NEVER write in my good books, but while reading this one, I was constantly underlining things that I wanted to remember or revisit. This fascinating book is more than just another view of our space program. It is filled with Mr. Kranz' thoughts on things such as inner courage and outward composure, staying ahead of the curve, never settling for anything but one's best in all things great and small, as well as the many noteworthy technical details of the controller's eye view of one of our nation's most courageous endeavors.  I also got from this book a metaphoric way to look at life's detours, by observation of how the mission control people had to totally rewrite the plans as unexpected things occured along almost every mission: you don't have to let the mistakes or bumps along the road throw you off, just write a new mission plan and procede from there until your goal is reached! Mr. Kranz' book also spoke of humility, thankfulness for the miracles in life, giving credit to talented hardworking people when it is their due, respect for those that you learn from, and allowing conflict, if it arises, to be just another way to hash out the best answer.  His experiences also illustrate how to learn from everything that you do and see, taking various pieces of wisdom from here and there, to make yourself into the person that you want to be, and achieve the goals that you want to achieve. You really can see his ultimate career in NASA unfolding as he gained experience from certain events that took place in his life. As for the writing style of this book, I loved it. As G.Gordon Liddy said, \"He writes like he talks, all heart and no B.S.!\". That says it all. I got very choked up reading Chapter 22 and the Epilogue and fully agree that our country has done some awesome things, but yet now is content to ponder the past and not concentrate on charging boldly into the future and making new dreams happen.  Well, I can't say it better than anyone else who has enjoyed and reviewed this book so I'll just say, thank you Mr. Kranz for writing your book, the wait was definitely worth it! :-)"

I've read other accounts of this time period, including the incredibly in-depth michener novel \"Space\".  What you don't often  see is the view from the controller's booth.  You don't see that often  there was absolutely no data or voice communications between early  spacecraft and the ground.  You don't see the months of drills that Mission  Control would stage, only to encounter problems that they could never have  dreamed.  Consequently, this account is a good read, and I enjoyed it.  You  may occasionally get bogged down by Franz's desire to name almost every  person he can think of, as well as the endless acronyms.  The jacket makes  a big connection with Apollo 13.  It is misleading because the book is far  more comprehensive than that.  Despite these shortcomings, I found it hard  to put down and eye-opening."

To say that Kranz's heart was and always will be in Mission Control is an understatement. After reading this, his whole life, it would  appear, is centered around his role as Flight Director. And what a life it was! Uncommonly unique details of the mission planning, training and performance abound here...reading of the training for Apollo 11, how the 1201 and 1202 computer alarms while performing powered descent were simulated on the last training day prior to the mission were priceless...nowhere would you get this level of detail (unless another Flight Director [other than Chris Kraft] writes his memoirs) and the unique telling of it. Kranz's opinions of his controllers and Flight Director peers are also unique in that no-one else could submit what it was like working with these people and for this program day-to-day like him. This is a quick and easy read with lots of unique information that should be counted with the many existing accounts that are \"required\" manned spaceflight reading."

To me Gene Kranz book  just justifys what goes on in mission control and what happens behind the  kurten.  To me when i read the chapter about Apollo 13 it just told you  that a mission controller will go to any lengths to save the crew even if  he is the Flight director i am almost done with the book but to me if you  go out and buy this book you will be on the edge of your seat the whole  time.  The first time i started to read i didnt want to put book down.  To  me it touched something in my heart that told me this man went from the low  man on the totom pole to what he was and in my mind is still today and that  is the flight director.

Kranz tells his story in such a way, that you don't have to be a mathematical engineer to understand how we really pushed our luck in achieving our ultimate goal...  The Lunar Landing."

He doesn't dive much into personal details except for the occasional note about his growing family and the fact that the white vests were his wife's idea but he does a job of describing the culture of Mission Control in NASA's early days. From his first encounter with the Mercury astronauts (\"Yeeee-haw!\") to Apollo 13 and beyond, he takes us behind the scenes to show us what it was really like."

If you had to choose one, I would go with Kraft's book since he was at the space program from the very start. But both these books give a view of the space program from Mission Control's perspective. While not quite as interesting as the astronauts, it is still very interesting. As an engineer, it makes me yearn for a time when an engineers work was part of something bigger in the nation's consciousness."

This is an autobiography of a person that is a true patriot, a true honest man and a true engineer. This book connects you with the limitations and capabilities of that era, but it has plenty of suggestions that apply to these days on how to build your team, how to select them, how to work with them. They knew the flights and ships were the most complicated things on earth, but they had built around them all the expertise and networking to figure out the problems that they couldn't foresee ahead of time. The experience gained in only a few years, of a person that handled the Apollo 13 crisis in the best possible way, it's a great lesson, you can learn a lot from that. And just to honor those astronauts that gave their lives for the space program, that are truly pictured across the book, I recommend this book."

However, this book by flight director Gene Kranz offers a new  perspective on the missions, as he explains how the dramatic events in the  void of space were handeled by mission control in Houston-Alan Shepard's  Freedom 7 flight, John Glenn's Friendship 7 flight, the first lunar orbit  on Apollo 8, the first lunar landing on Apollo 11, and the \"successful  failure\" of Apollo 13.  The story of these missions have been told  many times, yes, but not in the eyes of a man in mission control.  The book  is not high literature, as the sentences are short and choppy, but that is  not likely to concern a space buff reading this book.  Overall, this book  is a unique and new perspective on the early days of the space program."

Easily half of the text of any paragraph or chapter is a litany of names and people who were part of the team.  The \"story\" -- the successes-failures and near misses seem a minority of the book.  I would estimate that most people want to read about the missions themselves, not the endless training and names and schedules of those in mission control.  The book succeeds but only on the effort of the reader who has to endure all the \"extraneous\" stuff to get to the topics of interest.  This is Kranz' book.  No doubt this is the book he wanted to write.  He's going to fairly significant effort to give credit to others.  He comes across as a humble man who understood the moment in history but has no interest in claiming the spotlight as an individual.  But I grew tired of all the minutia sparingly interspersed between the \"meat\" of the book - at least IMO."

Kranz is about 10 years my senior and Gemini was underway when I graduated from college and began my engineering career in the Propellants Section of Saturn V Launch Operations at KSC. After facility activation and the second unmanned Saturn V (AS502) launch I moved to Houston and worked at JSC as a Space Suit Engineer for ILC Industries through the remainder of the Apollo program. So I saw it first hand from both the launch vehicle and astronaut viewpoints. Many books and articles I have read about this incredible period in American history do not get the facts straight and the exhilarating/dejecting emotions involved but Kranz personnel knowledge and writing skill nails it in this book. As a matter of fact his account so parallels my own that I am using it as a guide to write my memoirs. A great read and historical reference."

It might be hard to imagine action behind  a desk at Mission Control, but I couldn't wait to hear more stories after a  description of the first launch. Although sometimes over-detailed in who  did what between the launches, and sometimes it seemed like a Senior Class  yearbook in it's roll-call lauding, I was really hooked on hearing about  the program.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is even remotely  interested in flight, and to those who like a good book. It's like The  Right Stuff meets Yeager meets Apollo 13."

Well, when people like Gene Kranz were inventing space flight from scratch, they knew men's lives were at stake, not some quartley profit figure. And by the way, just like \"Play it again, Sam\" ... Mr. Kranz never did speak the words you heard in the movie.

Gene Kranz had one of those amazing careers, being there when \"the right stuff\" was required of him, and delivering it with competence and humility.  His narratives of the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo missions are wonderful, in my opinion, but even better, his fine character as a man comes through very clearly.  Giving 110% at all times, trusting in his abilities to inspire and lead his flight controllers, and his bottom-line reliance on God, are traits that should be admired and cultivated in all people.  The only part of the book I felt uncomfortable reading was the last chapter, where he laments the current absence of the pioneering spirit that kept him and his peers going, mission after mission.  I hope his testimony helps inspire a revival!"

There also wasn't a lot of personal stories; it was mostly just a chronology.  At times, this book seemed like a NASA PR piece.  Everybody was great at what they did; they were all geniuses in one way or another.  That got old after a while.  If you're looking for inside dirt, this is not the book for you."

There is NEVER A DULL MOMENT.. somthing always seems to go haywire.. and when it does, The good ol boys at mission control with the skill of the astronaughts do their damnest to fix it. a Truly awe inspireing book not only for space buffs but for any one who needs a good pick er upper. A true tribute to our Space Program. Kranz inspired by Kennedy's words \"ask not what your country can do for you .. ask you can do for your country\" and \"We choose to go to the moon - in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard.\" A true Patriot Kranz is. I wish there were more people like Gene Kranz out there. I salute you Gene Kranz!"

                "Text": "In the book Coffee Will Make You Black, by April Sinclair, the lead character Jean  Stevenson, Stevie to her friends, tells in a narrative perspective of her adolescent years, growing up in Chicago in the 1960's.  The book is like Stevie's diary.  She tells you her experiences with boys,  girls, love, sex, popularity, school and racism in a comical and  to-the-point fashion.  The book is a quick, easy, fun read that hooks you  from the start.  It deals with very realistic issues that are fun and  interesting to read about.  The book makes you feel like you are part of  Stevie's chaotic life.  She gives you the opportunity to share her deepest,  darkest, secrets.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the book an 8.  I enjoyed reading it greatly, and finished it in one day.  I liked reading  it because it dealt with issues that I deal with.  It tells of Stevie's  hard times with boys, other girls, sex, love, popularity, which are all  important to me now as a freshman in high school.  It didn't take very  long to get into the book because the first page is a humorous anecdote  about a boy asking if 12 year old Stevie is a virgin.  Stevie, confused  with the meaning of virgin, goes home and asks her mamma.  The whole book  is little anecdotes like the one above so I liked it from the start.  The  book isn't very short yet the words and vocabulary are very easy and simply  written so stumbling over big words is not a problem.  Nothing very big  happens in the book, it stays rather monotone throughout.  Something I  found a little hard to understand was the slang.  Since Stevie is growing  up in the sixties in Chicago, there are bound to be differences in slang  but overall the read is easy.  It may be hard for younger people to read  this book because they might not get what some of the terms mean.  This book reminded me of many movies about teenage-hood.  Like American Pie  or Election.  I have never read another book by April Sinclair but I  enjoyed this book and will read other works by this author.  In class we  have reading groups where there are four groups of five kids and each group  reads a different book.  To decide which book to read the teacher read the  first pages of every book.  I enjoyed the first page so I signed up to read  this book.  Since the book is written from a females perspective, I think  that girls would relate and enjoy reading it more because it deals with  female issues. I can imagine a guy not understanding the complete intent of  the author.  The book is very funny so I think that the reader should have  a good sense of humor, and maybe someone that grew up in the sixties could  relate to an even greater extent.  \" What does `coffee will make you  black mean mama?'  `The old folks in the South used to tell that to  children so they wouldn't want to drink coffee.  The last thing anybody  wanted to be was black.\"'  This quote is from page 111 in the book.  I  chose this quote not only because it is obviously the line in which the  title of the book comes from, but because it also represents the feelings  about different races at the time.  I don't get why people ever thought  that darker skin made a difference.  Personally I think all racism is  ridiculous and that this quote is very interesting.  To think that back  then the children were told that in order to stay lighter they shouldn't  drink coffee is ridiculous.  It shows that back then they weren't proud of  their skin color and would do anything, like not drink coffee, to stay  lighter.  I wonder if maybe this saying was also to keep kids from just  drinking coffee.  Maybe they didn't want the children to drink too much  caffeine.  In any case being darker was the worst thing imaginable.  I hope  that this quote shows a little bit of how the book is written.  This is a  more serious moment in the book but I thought it was important.  I hope you  enjoy it as much as I did!"
