                "Text": "This is one of the standard monographs on hydrodynamic instabilities, considered a classic.  It was published by Oxford UP in 1961 and is kept in print (at a bargain price) by Dover.  It is still very usable, easy to  read, and an excellent introduction, although on some points it is out of  date.  For Rayleigh-Benard convection, a reader would do well to consult  more recent books like Drazin & Reid, Swinney & Gollub,  Koschmieder, and Getling.  However, nobody covers the linear theory better  than Chandrasekhar."

Chandasekhar's  explanations are clear, easily readable, and complete, and should be a  model for other writers.  Anyone working on fluids should own this."
