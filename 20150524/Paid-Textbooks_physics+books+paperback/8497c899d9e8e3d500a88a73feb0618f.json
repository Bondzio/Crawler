                "Text": "Dr. Krauss uses analogies like Feynman does to create lucid explanations for those who are interested in physics but don't have a degree in math or physics.  It is aptly described as \"A Guide for the Perplexed\".  Having an avid interest in physics I found it ideal. I have a degree in engineering science but am weak in the kind of math required for theoretical physics.  If you want to know more about physics but can't seem to find a book that you can understand, you should read this book!"

If you can get through it and understand 80% of what he is writing, you will be ahead of 95% of your friends. Not written for the person with zero background, nor for the scientist, but those of us in the middle who know a little and want to know more."

Krauss starts out at a welcome, remedial pace -- walking the reader through basic tenets of physics and mathematics. However, by the end of the book, Krauss has equipped the lay reader (like myself) to finally understand bleeding-edge concepts of physics like renormalization and symmetry-breaking. This book is for the enthusiastic learner, not the faint of heart."

However, for those that have a sturdier knowledge on the topic, this book is a fascinating read and a great addition to ones understanding on the mysteries of physics; from a non-scientist perspective. Lawrence Krauss lands a few enlightening points, with a a big emphasis on the ubiquity of symmetry. With his fantastic penmanship the reader will get a deeper glimpse into the workings of physics."
