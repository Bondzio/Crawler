                "Text": "Whoa!  What a book to read if you want a glimpse of where science is taking us in the future!  This highly interesting read does a great job of explaining current and future possiblities of tracking, improving and studying the human brain.  From current research of creating prosthetics which can be controlled from thought to 'helmet' scanners which can read your thoughts to portable body scanners like \"Doc\" from Star Trek used - the future possibilities are amazing.  There is so much work being done in creating ways to actually read one's mind - which would be of enormous benefit for some people stricken with disease...to implants in the brain to stimulate thought, movement, recovery from stroke or traumatic brain injury.  The book lightly touches on the downside of such technology - could police use some of these devices which are currently in development to read your mind? could the government?  What are the ethical implications of this technology?  How could it be controlled once it's on the open market?  The author did a great job of presenting the information in an easy to read, understandable format - I almost read the book in one sitting the concepts were so interesting.  The book touches on the amount of research being done by private companies as well as DARPA, and it left me feeling that  futuristic science fiction movie plots aren't really that far away from becomming a  reality."

                "Text": "Skip this book if you are a psychologist or have a background or training in cognitive science or the study of consciousness. The book will frustrate you, because Kaku gets his facts wrong so often--which is surprising given that Kaku is a scientist. For example, his theory of consciousness is not a theory of consciousness at all. It is sort of a theory of one kind of mental function, but certainly not a theory that has any chance of explaining why we need to have subjective experience (qualia). One could easily argue that Kaku's concept of consciousness, which centers on the mental function of making mental models of the future, could conceivably have nothing to do with conscious experience, since it may well be possible to create such models unconsciously. By the way, Kaku uses the term \"subconscious\" instead of \"unconscious,\" a term that carries its own misleading implications. And Kaku completely misconstrues David Chalmers' \"hard problem,\" among many other errors. Finally, Kaku tends to go on and on with long passages in which he ruminates about issues that he imagines might come up in the future, such as which children robots should be programmed to rescue in a disaster. With all that said, however, if you don't know anything about theories of consciousness or cognitive science, you might enjoy the book."

But having read intense books from Dr. VS Ramachandran and others on mind and consciousness, this book by Dr Kaku was a disappointment. It is a hodgepodge of quotes from various books. What irritated me the most of reference to all sci-fi movies in every page. Liked aspects of categorizing animal and plant kingdom by levels of consciousness, but beyond that you will read quotes from many pchycologists, neurosurgeons, references to movies like avatar and matrix, open questions about religion and god.....for an average reader, you've already heard it all and seen it all!!!"

I'm clear that curiosity moved myself to do it, because others books I've previously read from him that I feel satisfied after complete the reading. However, the issues presented in the book are shallow, and the theory about consciousness is very questionable. Maybe someone could say that is a divulgation book, but anyway in my opinion it is half way. I hope that Micho Kaku will go back to write about Physics that is his core subject."

But I went to hear Dr. Kaku speak recently, and his lecture was stunning in the breadth of ideas (and he's an entertaining guy). So I bought his book as soon as it came out, and I have not been disappointed. He writes in a manner that is easily understood even by those of us who are not scientists. The current brain research being done is amazing in scope, and the hope that ways to fix brain illnesses or irregularities, which affect all of us in some way, will  be found. Startling fact: half of our population over 80 will develop Alzheimer's, a human catastrophe that is slowly unfolding. Then there's Parkinson's, ADHD, depression, autism, and on and on. What scientific research could be more important to the fate of mankind than knowing more about our brains? But the book is about much more than just what's happening now. As the title implies, it's about the future and what is/is not possible. I loved it and intend to read some of the chapters again. I really enjoy a book that opens my mind to other possibilities."

                "Text": "Well informed cognitive scientists recognize that they have no consensual definition of consciousness, that they can't measure the presence of consciousness scientifically, and that the nature of mind-brain correlations remains a mystery. But the author of this book, who has no qualifications as a cognitive scientist, brushes all those concerns aside and simply declares, as if with papal infallibility, that the mind is nothing more than what the brain does. His assertion is treated as a self-evident fact, so no empirical evidence or compelling reasoning is offered in support of this hypothesis. A scientific hypnosis, unlike a philosophical theory or religious belief, must lend itself to empirical validation or refutation, but this reductionist hypothesis does not. Nevertheless, Kaku presents it as a scientific fact. This is pseudoscience at its worst.  As the historian Daniel Boorstin pointed out, the greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance, but the illusion of knowledge. By presenting the illusion of knowledge that the nature of consciousness and it's role in nature is already known scientifically, Kaku obstructs open-minded inquiry into this aspect of reality that has so far eluded scientific discovery."

                "Text": "A Physicist\u2019s take on the human mind, and where the latest science is and future possibilities on consciousness, the possibilities of telepathy, the possibility of telekinesis or just moving things by using your minds.  A chapter on the possibility of implanted memories.  A chapter on talk of enhancing human intelligence, so that we can all be as smart as Einstein.  A chapter on dreams, and creating dreams and thoughts.  The latest on mind control and altered states of consciousness.  Where computer scientists are on with artificial intelligence, and then chapters on existence as just energy and possible alien minds.  Overall a fascinating summary of all things in modern science relating to the human mind.  While I realize most of the information is probably gathered by researchers Dr. Kaku provides his take on all of the subject and brings in his own projections for what is possible for the human mind and civilization as a whole.  Just a fascinating book with tons of information, but still an easy read for the lay person.  Highly recommended, if you have a question feel free to leave a comment below and I will try to answer it."

Kaku often presents complex issues in a way that is easy t understand (but he does expect you to have a rudimentary understanding of the world around you). In this book, Kaku goes beyond physics and explores the human mind with the same style, grace, and presentation that flows throughout all his works. if you are a fan or familiar with Kaku, you are sure to be enthralled by his latest book. Kaku is more than a teacher, he is a guide down a mysterious path that only brings us better understanding of our true selfs and our place in the universe."

                "Text": "I liked everyone of his other books (though even then must say he was out of his comfort zone when speaking of socio economic topics).  With this one though it made me think here is a guy that is extremely smart and well spoken on some topics (technology, cosmology) but left me really wondering on others.  The first was with the definition of consciousness.  Kaku summarizes  consciousness as the ability to perceive the outside world and formulate models of it into the future.  The first few times he uses this definition I thought he may be planning to expand on it but instead he repeats endlessly.  To casually make this assessment on what is a topic that could take up several books was bothersome to say the least.  To add to this he talks of advancements to the mind only in terms of our current socio economic predicaments.  For instance he speaks of  a sort of telepathy that could be used on the battlefield overlooking that 1)future wars may not have human ground troops 2)if we could have telepathy we may find better ways of solving problems than shooting chunks of metal at eachother.  But more frustrating was the lack of discussion of the spiritual aspect of the human brain.  He talks about how we can be smarter and happier but not nicer (ie less psychotic).  This would be a controversial discussion no doubt and I hear you on the fear of a borg/bravenewworld scenario . Yet still with all the fascination of the brain of Einstein why not some mention of the brain of Ghandi, King, Gotama?  On the one hand you have the supposed techie nerds wanting to build HAL or Lawnmower Man and on the other are the supposed hippie granola types that appear to think humanity would be better off plowing fields and destroying all our gadgets. I have been looking for a book that is not aligned in either camp but sees the value in both.  Other than Ray Kurzweil not much out there.  On a personal note I am more bitter with the neo hippies that dont see the value in adding their voice to the AI/Mind Enhancement topic.  I have been a fan of Mr. Kaku from his other books but was disappointed in his ability to step outside of the technerd box."

He continues his high quality output with this new book which captures your interest immediately and keeps it right to the end. I found it to be a quick read that I did not want to put down. The author takes you on a tour of the brain by starting with the physical, moving to the mind, then consciousness, then leaving the body altogether with speculation of how consciousness may exist independently.  Fascinating treatment of current events, and recommended for everyone who has a brain. Science is moving quickly these days -don't get left behind. Read this book!"

As one of the world's leading theoretical physicists it is abundantly clear from his books that the author understands the subjects he writes about extremely well. Reading his books are a joy. The subject of \"consciousness\" is one I have been extremely interested in and have accordingly read several books on over the last few years. This book is by far, the best I have read on the subject. Fascinating and easy to understand."

Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, because I loved Kaku's other books so much. Kaku's books on far-out physics-- superstring theory, wormholes, and other dimensions--are simply extraordinary, but in this new book about the mind, he's not accurately informed about a number of scientific studies in parapsychology, cognitive enhancement, near-death experience research, psychedelic drugs, etc., and simply parrots the mainstream \"scientific\" opinion, sometimes even getting the facts wrong. Nonetheless, the book is filled with lots of wonderful information about the brain, new technologies, and bold speculation about the future that I really enjoyed reading."

He has the amazing gift of taking his significant understanding of complex topics and translating them into easily digestible language for ordinary human beings.  This book is an ever so slight bend from his usual topics (although not as far from them as I originally thought it might be) by focusing on the mind.  He leverages all of his theoretical physics knowledge, coupled with his extensive conversations with neuroscientists, to put a unique perspective to the potential that lies within each one of us - in \"The Future of the Mind.\"  I highly recommend this book to all who are curious about what the future may hold."

                "Text": "This encyclopedic snapshot of a wide range of scientific research relates to just two newly revealed mother lodes of source material: the human brain and outer space. Dr. Michio Kaku, a theoretical physics professor at the City College and City University of New York, describes his boyhood fascination with both subjects and his facility in discussing what would appear to be very distant but some-how related answers to exciting new discoveries that get little mention in the popular press. Bu Kaki and his colleagues have given rise to a plethora of movies and TV series focused on the misuse or outright evil cooked up by the world's bad guys to take advantage of super or telepathic brains, brain networks and intelligent robots. Then Kaku switches over to the vastly more complicated subject of aliens from outer space. Even though we have not yet to find one, Kaku dives in these soon-to-be-charted waters. The professor provides much interesting speculation on the consciousness and intelligence of these creatures who may be trillions of years ahead of us and as interested in us as we are in fruit flies. More than a popularizer, Kaku interviews many of the science protagonists mentioned in his book. And he he seems to know just what questions to ask the not-always-communicative scientists. Definitely worth a read or a listen (14 CDs) to anyone who cares to know what the pointy heads are up to these days. With a strong voice, Feodor Chin, a professional actor, keeps a steady pace, in his reading."

This is a well-organized mixture of scientific summary and basic philosophical speculation that help to integrate even the most non-scientific reader into the central problems hovering around neuroscience today. Because Kaku is a physicist, the work displays some surprising cameos from physicists and their perspective on the human mind, though these ultimately benefit the reader without mystifying the work's biological/chemical center of study. Kaku is a very balanced thinking and remains constantly aware of the need for a scientific defense of his claims. I am interested to read his other works: he is exceptionally gifted as a popular science writer, though I admit that he is also shamelessly self promoting."

I have thoroughly enjoyed Kaku's treatment of physical concepts through his other works, as he does an exceptional job of relating complex physical concepts in an accessible manner.  However, I found that The Future of the Mind was a bit incoherent.  Topics seemed to ramble and bleed together without appropriate segues and the author seems to go off on tangents.  For example, the lengthy section on robotics is an interesting topic, but it's correlation to neurology is so loose that it seems like it would've been better treated in a different book altogether.  Kaku does an extensive amount of research. He visits labs and interviews scientists all over the world, but I didn't get a sense that his notes were well organized in the end product."

In this case, however, Professor Kaku provides a way to understand what the brain may be able to accomplish through technology, based on somewhat of what is being accomplished today. For we laymen who are not particularly familiar with the brain and the way it operates, Future of the Mind provides some insight into the way this complex, powerful, and magnificent structure works.

                "Text": "I think a better title might be \"The Future and the Mind\". In his readable, comprehensive style, Kaku goes somewhat too far with speculation instead of science. It's fine that he has seen so much of the future in sci-fi writing and movies, but linking plot points to \"someday we may, it is possible, perhaps they will ...\" was too frequently an easy way out of the realm of science fact. In addition, he glosses over many important issues of values and ethics raised by the research and hypotheticals he explores. That said, I found this book well worth reading because it weaves knowns in current neurological research with physics and discusses the implications of both these fields on our future as a society and a species."

The book seems to be directed to an audience that is more familiar with psychology, and less familiar with physics (as you might expect from a physics author who is able to write at length about physics principles, but is less familiar with psychology, or neuroscience). Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I would have given it a full five stars had it not been for a few sections that felt repetitive, a few chapters that felt disjointed, and a few glaring grammatical errors. Overall, I would recommend the book to those whose leisure reading includes non-fiction."

Sadly, the professor does not explore the obvious implications of extending the Brain Computer Interface to an external memory and computational device accessible via miniature WiFi antenna, which of course could be installed on a chip.  Imagine a diplomat speaking any foreign language required ...fluently..simply by tapping into a translation device the size of a ring they wear.  Or learning to play piano like a concert master...by slipping on a watch.  The future of the mind extends beyond the limits of biology, and its only a matter of time."

The reason the beginning was bad is because it gives you a basic intro into how the brain works and being that I do research in this area, it was boring for me.  But this guy is a genius, the stuff you learn after the first 110 or 120 pages is incredible.  I can't believe that a theoretical physicist like Michio Kaku can create a book better than that of any neuroscience.  It's like a baseball player coming out and beating the heavy weight boxing champion of the world in his first fight.  Michio Kaku is the greatest ambassador or science or all time, hands down!"

How I would love to know what he knows! Talk about a transcendant experience! Unfortunately, science isn't quite there. Yet. But that hasn't stopped Dr.Kaku from taking us \"one step beyond\" in his exploration of what the present state of physics suggests might be possible in the not too distant future. If you have a literal mind, this is not a book for you. Dr. Kaku's speciality is theoretical physics not material science so he does what theorists are supposed to do: extrapolate from what we know and have the equipment to measure or observe right now to the furthest edge of possibility. It can be argued that we are only in the very early stages of \"brain science\" but the rate of discovery in the field is progressing exponentially. Almost daily researchers publish new - and often unexpected - findings on how the physical brain functions. We are beginning to be able to see the path of a thought as it travels the neuro-circuits of the physical brain. But thought itself cannot be seen, weighed, or measured in any way. It is invisible and leaves only the faintest temporary imprint for us to observe. Dr. Kaku wrestles with the problem of consciousness in his quest to understand the MIND. Our minds use our brains to record and communicate thought. But is Mind identical with Brain? This is the question that must ultimately be asked and answered. What IS consciousness and where does it come from? Is it dependent on the brain or does it exist in the quantum universe and express itself through conscious creatures in the form of thought? And, if so, does that mean that pure consciousness really does exist and that it has intention and will? Dr. Kaku is one of our planet's most enquiring minds and he'd like to know. So would I. I think I'll stick around and wait to see what he does next."

He states that relatively little research has been done on animal consciousness, but then goes on to categorize their neurological complexity based on what I can only assume to be his own chauvinistic conjecture.His callous discussion of experimentation on primates also bothered me. This book serves as an interesting survey for some of the more recent innovations in neuroscience, but little more. Hopefully his books on physics are better."

To be clear the ignorance is not the authors so much as the lack of data in this new field of science, and he certainly does his best to wrap his brilliant mind around the current lack of knowledge about brain and mind. What we get is a book with some rehashed themes from his earlier books, all well grounded in physics mixed with a good overview of the current state of neurologic. Its good but not great."

It examines the brain as an organ without the nonsense promoted by organized religion, yet it provides a corollary of the soul as it might exist in an organic form. Kaku examines concepts such as mind control, hypnotism, brainwashing, and telepathy as they relate to physics, dispelling many of the common myths about the brain. I was disappointed that Kaku didn't narrate the entire book, but the narration was well done."

To really appreciate all the information presented, one must read the book and then begin again and read a second time.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious about science and the astonishing human brain."

The fact that this frustrating individual goes to say there is no cure and people get it wearing pots on their head is insane. And, it is frustrating to see this authors popularity which encourages unsuspecting consumers too have dangerously incorrect knowledge. When the public holds someone who is unknowledgeable at a high state of respect then the masses become stupid. I think it is time for humans to accept that these heavy metals all around us are causing insanity, psychosis, mood swings, halucinations. This is a known fact that doctors refuse to allow you to know (how? they have a high regard in the community)(Why do they not tell you? #1 Money-they can make a lot of money selling drugs from glaxo smith klein who had a 3 billion dollar fine 2 years ago due to corruption. Im so sad that Americans are allowed to get sick, forced to live a low quality of life, forced to stay out of work and rely on big government. As Reagan said \"we are not the solution, we are the problem. Someone needs to let the consumers understand where psychosis comes from and how to get rid of it ie chelation chlorella alfalfa cilantro nac apple pectin onions garlic etc etc vit c. Dont be a victim to corruption all around us."
