                "Text": "I just finished a graduate level quantum mechanics course where Cohen-Tannoudji's \"Quantum Mechanics\" was the primary text.  This work as both strengths and weaknesses.  On the plus side, it is as extremely comprehensive and detailed treatment of non-relativistic quantum mechanics as can be found, and makes an outstanding reference work.  On the down-side, it took me half of the semester to learn how to find things quickly within the text, and I never felt as if it really helped me learn quantum in the intuitive sense.  While the mathematical formalism was there, the language CT used to describe these phenomena seemed lacking.  Fortunately, my copy of Sakurai helped me more with these less formal descriptions, and made a welcome complement to Cohen-Tannoudji.  While CT may be the most comprehensive text I have seen, I would not recommend it being the only text used for a class."

                "Text": "A good, \"deep\" and complete presentation of quantum mechanics. The first chapter is great for basic ideas of QM. This is followed by a chapter on the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics and a very good chapter that lays out the postulates of quantum mechanics. Then it covers spin, the harmonic oscillator, angular momentum, and the hydrogen atom. It seems to me the book is the best around for teaching Dirac notation and matrix mechanics. Each chapter is accompanied by appendices that develop further detail or provide examples of various concepts. For help with problem solving, I recommend Quantum Mechanics Demystified and the Schaum's Outline of Quantum Mechanics. For a good reading companion, I recommend the Griffiths Quantum Mechanics book."

                "Text": "Cohen-Tannoudji writes an excellent QM text for first-year graduate or advanced undergraduate students.  The book is well organized, complete, and contains fundamental concepts and relations as well as some more interesting, advanced topics.  It takes some time to get through, and not a book that you can read at the breakfast table, but the reward is well worth the effort.  A good supplement would probably be Sakurai.  I think it is better than Griffiths, if more didactic.  I have used the book for a first-semester graduate QM course after a one-semester introductory course with Griffiths.  It is a good reference book as well as a main text."

The book is very well organized and gives detailed explanations and examples of key quantum mechanical concepts.  I would suggest that all undergraduates give it a try.  It balances out importance of detail while maintaining clarity to give students a good understanding of the subject.  Though it is a little hard to digest at first, that is just the nature of the subject.  Once you become familiar with the basics of quantum mechanics, postulates, bra-ket etc this is a perfect book to learn from, or to go back as reference"

                "Text": "This is probably the best book on quantum mechanics ever written, from a pedagogical standpoint. It leaves no stones unturned. Cohen works out tons of examples in exquisite details, like no one does. His presentation style is clear and complete. He makes extensive use of perturbation theory, so if you read this book, you will become an expert at it. He covers atoms, molecules, solids, gases, I don't see what else could be included in an introductory text. This book really show his mastery of the topic. My only complaint is that the book is rather long, the discussions are long, and it's not a quick read. But I don't think this was the intent when he wrote it. He meant it as a comprehensive introduction, and he did a great job at it. 5 stars. I would give 6 stars if I could. Another possible complaint is that the book doesn't cover 2nd quantization, but this is almost never done in an introductory book anyways, so this is not a valid complaint either. A 3rd complaint is the book doesn't cover path integrals, but again, this is never considered introductory material and therefore is normally left out of an introductory exposition. For those topics not covered, excellent textbooks already exist (for example, Cohen-Tannoudji's books on quantum electrodynamics, or any of the recent books on condensed matter field theory will cover the above-mentioned topics)"

                "Text": "This seems to be a very typical graduate level text at most universities, but I don't think it is organized very well nor is it very readable.  First of all, the book is translated from French which probably did not help the formating and prose much.  Second the notation used in the text seemed arcane and dated.  I remember spending hours just to figure out what some of the notation was trying to convey.  I think a thorough reading of Griffiths QM book would be much more advised than trying to read this book.  However, all that being said, perhaps the book might be useful as a refrence as it is rather encyclopedic.  In summation, find a better QM book to study from than this one."
