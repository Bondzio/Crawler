                "Text": "We are all conflicted about the traditional portrayals of God and the insights of modern science.  David Nelson has written a thoughtful, complete and enjoyable book that provides a fascinating and inspirational reconciliation of the two. I found my self giggling with delight at the insights David Nelson provides, and fascinated by the easy to understand explanations of such concepts as quantum science and string theory. He starts with a remarkable yet obvious question: what if God were not a third party, but rather and integral part and cause of how things happen?  Not simply the designer, but rather the very operation of the system.  Like Nelson, I'm not a physicist, but he was able to communicate complex concepts in easily understood terms"

                "Text": "Judaism, Physics And God: Searching For Sacred Metaphors In A Post-Ein-stein World strives to answer the question, \"If we can't see it or prove it, how can we believe it?\" Leading the reader on a journey through both the ideas of modern physics and the ancient teachings of rabbinic text, Judaism, Physics and God stresses that faith and scientific insight do not need to be mutually exclusive. Chapters explore cosmology and creation, quantum mechanics, Albert Enstein's theories of special relativity, general relativity and Jewish meaning, string theory, and integrating new metaphors and scientific awareness into traditional Jewish life. As meticulous in its research of sacred Judaic texts and philosophy as it is of modern physics, yet presented to be as accessible as possible to the lay reader striving to better understand complex concepts, Judaism, Physics And God is a welcome addition to religious debate and studies shelves. Highly recommended."

                "Text": "This book ranks in the top five books I have ever read!  The author has taken the most complex ideas and theories and made them understandable to me.  I have no science background, but I could understand what he said.  For the first time in my life, I had an idea of what Einstein's theory of relativity  is all about.  I will refer over and over again to this book.  It is one of the best I have read on such complex things."
