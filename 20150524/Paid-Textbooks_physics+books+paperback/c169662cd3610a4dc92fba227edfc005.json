I was particularly impressed with the \"Watch Out!\" and \"Got the Concept?\" boxes, whose purpose is to address some common physics misconceptions. The examples and problems are well chosen, the text is crisp and the illustrations are great. I recommend it without reservation."

The only difference was the end of chapter problem sets were missing.  They weren't used in my class anyway.  If you want to save $60 to $80 this is the route to go.  I'll there's a preliminary edition of a book i'll always buy that one from now own."
