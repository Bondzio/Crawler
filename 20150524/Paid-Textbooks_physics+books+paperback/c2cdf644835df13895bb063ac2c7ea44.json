                "Text": "My daughter used with study guide to help her with her AP Physics exam.  She loved the examples and the fact that there were prior tests in book to help her study.  The steps and guides were very helpful and she learned a lot that was not covered in her regular AP Physics class.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is taking the AP test, or for your child who will be taking the exam.  Good luck!"

                "Text": "I ran across the first book, 5 Steps to a 5 AP Physics B and C in the library. I thought this was the book recommended for my review of Physics for my Florida Teachers Certification Examination 6-12. It turns out it was not but I am glad I checked it out. Having seen the copyright date, I looked to see if there were a newer edition. There was and it is even better. The new book is specifically for the AP Physics B test. It has been updated to include relevant equations at the beginning of the chapter to guide your learning. It is an excellent review for general physics at the high school and college level and will be a recommendation of mine in the classroom. My only advice would be to place a recommended link section at the end of each chapter for additional study. I read that the author is doing a new book for the AP Physics courses so I look forward to getting a copy when available."
