                "Text": "I agree with those readers who say that the book is very long for what it contains. It is also full with personal life details which are not so important to be reported to the reader. But what has hit me most is the author's claim that the information theory was already there at the end of the XIX century, forgetting Shannon and his paper. Shannon deserves much more than only mentioning him (together with Nyquist and Wiener, clearly minor actors in information theory) in a line! This a very bad book when the author deals with history, written by an amateur, not a professional. In my edition cover it is written: \"I urge you to buy this book\" citing John Gribbin (from whom I took the advice): well you can buy it but do not waste your time in reading it (just scan it)."

You get so busy with the things that you need to remember and deadlines that you need to meet that you don't really get a chance to read scientific books. But, once I heard this book was coming out, I made sure I had it ASAP. It was intriguing to me that someone wanted to try to make sense of our vast universe by using computer science. Well, this book was worth it. Sure, a lot of people might not understand what this book is talking about, but as a computer scientist, I thought the author should be applauded for his unique approach to the science of the Cosmos. Seth really laid it out there, and I thought the explanations that he provided in the book were clear (Well, except some parts that I am still not clear about, but that is probably my fault). Over all, an excellent book and a must have for everybody interested in this field of science."

                "Text": "...and a very interesting book.  SL does a fine job of explaining how classical computers (driven by bits) relate to quantum computers (driven by qubits); how quantum computing works (in theory for the most part, successful experimentation in this area being being quite modest at present); and how quantum computing relates to the quantum world.  By the end of PtU, I had a decent grasp not only of why the universe should itself be thought of as a kind of vast (and ever expanding) computer but of how a universe-as-computer model of physics adds value to pre-existing models.  Really fascinating stuff, and a deceptively 'easy' read."

                "Text": "I think Seth Lloyd does an admirable job with what he set out to do.  His insite into the smallest \"bits' of the universe and how they potentially interact with one another and the implications on our \"macro\" world are solid.  Of course his is only a theory at present, but a realistic theory that is tied to actual experimental physics, and not just idle speculation.  In order to build an understanding of the universe we live in, it is vital that we gain a comprehension of the basic foundation everything else is built on....and of. Dr. lloyd simplifies the explanation of a very challanging subject to make it very understandable to even a non-technical reader. This in itself is no easy task. Judging by the harsh critisisms invoked by several of the other reviewers, it also drives a nail in the coffin of proponents of the current fundemental foolishness such as ID,  and it is a welcomed nail indeed. Considered in conjunction with other books on the subject of modern physics, \"Programming The Universe\" definitely has a spot on my shelf of reference material around which Postmodernist Philosophy is developing."

                "Text": "I had been hearing about Quantum Computing (QC) for a while and finally I decided to get some basic knowledge and purchased this book. There are some interesting ideas here about information and physics that have been proposed by many researchers in both the physical sciences and engineering, but the book spent too much time discussing very fundamental physics concepts that someone with a few semesters of university physics already knows and this was time that could have been better spent discussing other things. It's likely that Lloyd was trying to reach as broad an audience as possible, but realistically, most of his readers are going to be people who have an interest in science and already have some degree of knowledge of it. Another issue with the book is that it lacks sufficient discussion of how a quantum computer may be engineered and made to compute things we are interested in. It's only in Chapter 6, \"Atoms at Work,\" (about half-way through the book) that the author finally starts to write about how a quantum computer might actually be constructed and even then, the discussion is brief."
