Knight is very accurate in his descriptions of student misconceptions. Before I began to teach each unit of study, I consulted this book to gain some fresh ideas and insights. I was never disappointed.  He also provides specific examples of problems that he uses in the classroom, and exam questions."

It lays out inquiry based instruction for all levels of physics and backs its claims with physics education research. This book additionally discusses particular subjects within the physics curriculum and defines the misconceptions that students often bring to the classroom. Prior know of these misconceptions helps the instruction in lesson planning and labs."

                "Text": "I've been aware for a long time that students resist learning physics because they have a hard time letting go of what they think they already know.  I've had some limited success overcoming the students' preconceptions but it is a constant challenge.  This book translates existing research on effective physics teaching into a practical approach.  I found it fascinating and can't wait to start putting it to work.  It is, for the most part, clear and convincing.  I do wish the author gave more thorough examples and explanations of the different types of diagrams he assigns to students.  Nevertheless, even though the book is really written for college professors, I found it very adaptable to my class for ninth graders."
