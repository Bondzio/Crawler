                "Text": "This solutions manual is not like most where the solutions simply cover odd problems. Instead, this book has chosen \"selected\" problems to solve. This means that there are some odd and some even numbered problems. Apparently they are problems which the author of the book thinks best illustrate the concepts in each chapter. While the solutions are thorough, including both a conceptual discussion and the mathematical solution, they include too much information. I prefer a simple solution where I can see the bare-boned mathematics in as many examples as possible. I was disappointed to find only an unpredictable collection of solutions which used precious space in the book at the expense of other problem solutions. As I said, the solutions themselves are decent-I just wish they were all there."

It is indeed helpful for those problems it does have solutions for, which is why I rated it 3 stars, however if you need a hint to a problem with no solution, you're stuck!"
