                "Text": "If you are a grad student in high energy/nuclear/heavy ion physics, experimental or theoretical, do yourself a favour and buy this book. It starts really from the begining (scalar fields, spinors, dirac equation, propagators)  and slowly but steadily reaches the point of gauge field  theory, QCD, partons, electroweak interactions , spontaneous symmetry  breaking and the Weinberg-Salam model. Dont expect to find anything  rigorous about renormalization. Chapter 7 has some calculations about  running coupling constants etc. but most of it is intuitive (describing  rather than proving) in order to give you a glimpse about these matters and  serve as a tool for later chapters. Although I knew the basics of Quantum  Field Theory before I read this book, it helped me understand topics like  deep inelastic scattering, parton distribution functions, scaling, weak  interactions,spontaneous symmetry breaking. Caution: It is not a Quantum  Field Theory book, it is a particle physics book. If you are looking for  gribov anomalies,ward-takahashi identities, and renormalization of the  weinberg-salam model and stuff like that then this is not the place to find  it. The book is about particles and their interactions. Its purpose is to  prepare the serious student for more rigorous Quantum Field Theory books  and give him/her the big picture of the standard model (the forest) rather  than the little details of field theory (the tree). I strongly recommend it  to any student in the field. The language is clear and the concepts are  easy to follow. Its a down to earth approach trying to explain things in a  clear cut manner rather than confusing the student with \"big  words\" and terminology. A nice suplement to this book is the book by  Chris Quigg (...huge number of references). In short, this book is  worth its money ! Buy it !"

                "Text": "This is a very good treatment of particle physics. Unfortunately, its one of those textbooks where exercises are dispersed throughout the text and which form an integral part of the pedagogy. In other words, the reader must work through the problems as they appear in the book as subsequent material is based upon it; not to do the exercies will result in an incomplete and fragmented exposure to the material. Some might like that approach but I personally find it irritating and slows down the reading. As I mentioned its a very well written expose of particle physics but it could have been great if its format had been more traditional."

                "Text": "This book is really a jewel. It was used extensively to support two famouse theoretical courses at Imperial College London, namely, Unification and Advanced Particle Physics. It doesn't have typos, its extremely concise and the mathematics are extremely well presented and explained (without hand-waving anything). It explains very simply and clearly hard-to-grasp concepts (a lot of it as part of the Appendix) such as symmetries and their link to particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking, Feynman diagrams, Abelian and Non Abelian groups, Fermi theory and in general an excellent explanation of the properties of particles. I would recommend buying this book to any Theoretical Physicist taking Advanced Particle Physics courses or interested in knowing the mathematics of High Energy Physics (and not just the theory, because for that there are many other good story-teller books!)."
