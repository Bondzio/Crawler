                "Text": "One of the reasons I bought this physics study aid was because I read Mr. Curran's \"Homework Helpers-Chemistry\" and found it to be an excellent help in my pursuit to learn Chemistry.  The author once again has hit a homerun with his physics book. Concepts from the classical areas of physics (Newtonian mechanics, electricity, magnetism, light, thermodynamics)covered in a first-year course in high school or college are explained in a conversational style while retaining appropriate rigor.  The chapter tests are well-written (with the answers to test questions explained), and the interspersed diagrams help to reinforce topics covered in each chapter. I'm glad I came across both of these books."

I recommend either of these books for anyone taking physics or chemistry at the high school, college level or someone like me preparing for a test. The Homework Helper assists me when I don't quite get the concept from the text book. Great resource. There are some questions that are given to help one understand and then the answers are just a few pages away."

All of these topics are written well and explained clearly; like I said, it's very good on the topics it DOES contain. The only problem I've found with this book is that it doesn't include anything on Relativity or Quantum Mechanics. Yes, it does go in depth about light, photons, and the wave-particle duality of light. Very helpful overall in the basics, but it doesn't go into the really advanced topics. I can't tell if this was meant for College Physics or high-school physics........either way, the explanations were great and it is, really, a great book. If you're taking physics on any level, get this book."

I used it first before reading the textbook allowing me to better understand the textbook. Without it I probably wouldn't have received an A in intro physics. However, it doesn't receive 5 stars from me because a couple of topics were missing (e.g. fluids, sounds and waves). I definitely recommend this book for any intro physics student in college or high school."
