                "Text": "I'm a tutor who just got this book to brush up a little, since I hadn't tutored AP physics in a while and I'm working with a student who's pretty sharp.  This book is a joke, though, in terms of just how few a pages of content there are; overall about a third the thickness of Barron's AP Chem book, which I also have (and like).  This thing is so brief, it's like reading Cliffs Notes of Cliffs Notes -- it's barely an overview of the subjects.  For example, I just tried to go in and review electrostatics before an appointment, and electric potential has exactly one page.  Are you kidding me?  There are multiple equations on the AP equation sheet for potential, yet the book doesn't even mention half of them.  And this is like the fourth topic I've looked up and found way too little explanation of."

                "Text": "This AP Physics resource is technically outdated, but it's like an old textbook, the math doesn't change in physics and is still a good review book. Its not as thick as other Barron's books coming in at roughly an inch. The review material may be for the old AP physics B test, but if you combine AP Physics 1 and 2 it is largely the same as Physics B. This book still has quality material and is a good review before tests and eventually the AP test. This is an old review manual, but that doesn't make it bad. The notes, tests, and strategies are still pretty decent and if you're struggling to find a good AP Physics 1 or 2 resource I'd start with this."

                "Text": "The text part of the book is excellent.  Ofter it details a problem solved with a unique visual solutions.  I am using a much older version of the book and it is also full of errors on the actual test sections.  I was so frustrated that I wanted to purchase a new edition hoping that this problem was corrected.  Based on other reviews, I'll stick to this book for supplement to text only.  I like Schaums Outline of College Physics, which is also non-calculus based.  So far, the books have approached problems differently which one may appreciate based on your learning style."
