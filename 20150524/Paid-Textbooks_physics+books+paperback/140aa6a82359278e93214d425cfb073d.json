                "Text": "The physics vol. 2 continue farther about more physics concept, especially focus on electrical field. The books explain clearly how concept is been applied and shows example how it related to our daily life in physics. It is great book to start at freshman college level and great book to keep for future reference."

                "Text": "This textbook definitely makes physics easier to learn. If you think otherwise, open up a book from twenty years ago and then try to complain. The layout of the chapters is a great way to split up all the details of learning something as relatively complex to grasp as physics. There's lots of colors, images, examples, real world applications, and conceptual questions to help you learn the material in the most mind-friendly environment. I am extremely thankful that I am learning the mathematical and problem-solving aspects of physics in 2012/2013 than in the 80's or 90's. Some of the questions at the end of each chapter can be quite challenging, but mastering those makes mastering the tests an easy feat to accomplish."
