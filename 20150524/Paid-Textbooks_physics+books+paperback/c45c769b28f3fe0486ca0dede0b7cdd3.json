Also, the author references several (a lot) equations from previous chapter rather than just rewriting them.  It makes the book difficult to follow because you have to keep flipping pages to previous chapters for the referenced equations."

The table of contents is really impressive, but reading the book is a horror.  If you've taught a course in statistical mechanics, it is probably okay as a reference, but otherwise stay away!"
