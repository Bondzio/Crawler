These are nice solid books and I expect he'll have them for the rest of his life. They have a feel and a heft that seems to convey the essence of the subject. He's happy and all I can say for myself is the day these books arrived he opened the box took them out and looked at them, then he walked over and without a word gave me a hug. Yes, I love this purchase."

                "Text": "Of all the physics textbooks currently available on the market, this one seems to be the best at explaining phenomena and challenging the reader to think creatively about the material. The only gripe I can possibly give about this series is that there is a distinct lack of problem sets, which can lead to more artistic studying rather than actually putting the legwork into understanding physics. This can be solved by purchasing one of the many books out there that are almost entirely problems, and using them to help you keep up with Feynman's lectures."

I am amazed at how clearly written this book is.  The arguments and equations are simple to follow, and usually you do not need to verify the calculations but if you do, there's plenty of margin space to do so, which I really appreciate.  Feynman does not get bogged down in details.  But he does not omit important points.  And there is no shortage of illustrations.  If you want to get a \"feel\" for quantum theory, then this is the book for you.  Feynman is quoted as having said that no one truly understands quantum mechanics.  That's probably true but Feynman seems to know about it more than most authors.  If I were stuck on a desert island, this would be one of the quantum books I would want to have with me."

                "Text": "Feynman was apart of a committee back in the day where they would review these textbooks for elementary and high schools and recommend which books the school should get. Feynman spent lots of his time reading through 300 hundred pounds of textbooks (first for math, then for science). He realized that these 'new' generation of books aren't good for the students. They lacked how and why. They included fake or useless practical applications. Description was lacking because the textbooks were made by people who know nothing on the subject. Finally this book was created based off his lectures at caltech and it doesn't lack anything that the textbooks he reviewed did. It's still solid with accurate information all these years, although its accurate it necessary isn't updated."

The math prerequisite isn't that much either: calculus, elementary linear algebra, and elementary differential equations. One thing I might add is this would be a very difficult first exposure without the help of a professor. There are some parts that seem a little too wordy at times and others that seem as though he is showing off at how little you need to arrive at a fundamental result. Don't be fooled, this isn't Feynman's first rodeo. Overall a great series of lectures. Bravo prof feynman"

P.S. u have to reread each chapter for at least 2 times even though u think u understand it"
