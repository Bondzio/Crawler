                "Text": "There is no doubt that Albert Einstein has been one of the most brilliant minds of the past century. His major contribution to science was the special and the general theory of relativity, which gave a new dimension to  that we call today \"Modern Physics\". Many people feel frustrated because  when they try to understand relativity, they find some authors that expound  in their books a complex arrangement of equations referring to the  mathematical part of the theory, namely, the books are accessible for  people with certain levels of knowledge (that is the case of engineers,  physicists, mathematicians, among others). Nevertheless, perceiving and  anticipating this situation, Albert Einstein wrote this book (more than  fifty years ago) whit the purpose of exposing the special and the general  theory of relativity in such a way that anyone can understand it. I this  sense, I think, Einstein succeeded because despite the shortness of the  book, the same covers the most important aspects of relativity in a clear  and concise form. Moreover, the book has appendixes where the author makes  reference to some interesting subjects like the problem of space and  relativity, the experimental confirmation of the theory, to name a few. If  you have decided to learn something about relativity, and you do not have  vast knowledge in physics and mathematics, I sincerely recommend you this  book. On the other hand, if you were a reader looking for more technical  information (mathematical foundation of general relativity), I would choose  the book \"Gravitation\" written by Misner, Wheeler y Thorne. This text  represents an encyclopedia about general relativity."

                "Text": "The reviewer of April 13 from Moscow, Idaho says this is not the book to read unless you already understand the theory.  Maybe fair enough.  It was written when Einstein had achieved youthful fame, though, not in his  dotage, if he had such a thing. It may be a little more difficult for the  translation, but not much.  Contrary to some reviewers, it is not that easy  to follow, and if it seems like an easy read, you probably haven't  understood it.  There are many books written since where it is probably  easier to learn about special relativity, to say nothing of the basic ideas  of general relativity.  But once you have started to get the hang of  things, this book is a masterpiece of exposition!  It allows one to follow  Einstein's actual thought process in arriving at these theories -- pretty  much by a process of pure thought -- more or less in the steps he probably  took himself.  There is not a word in the exposition that was not carefully  thought out. So, learn the theory somewhere else and then read this book --  you'll understand the theory better for reading Einstein's book -- or read  this book first, keep going back to it 'til it starts to make sense, and  maybe consult some other, more \"user-friendly\" textbook at the  same time.  Einstein claims his book allows a lay reader with only high  school math to understand relativity.  To which a friend of mine replied  \"Yeah, if you have an IQ of 800\".  To which I say, have patience,  keep thinking about it and going back to it."

                "Text": "While reading the reviews I noticed something.  The special case was considered well written, while the general theory was considered difficult to follow.  There is a simple explanation to this, Leopold Infeld (protege of Einstein's) helped in the rewriting of the Special Case, his English was much more fluent than that of Einstein.  Infeld was also a superb teacher, as such he had a fluency and a rhythm with words that is easy to follow.  I highly recommend any of Einstein's writings but also caution you as to his readability... On the other hand Einstein recognized this and coauthored with Infeld, (or rewrote with him previous writings), as such I highly recommend that you get those books coauthored or written by Leopold Infeld."

This book requires a lot from a reader, in which the reader will probably have to reread passages all over again to grasp the math behind this theory. The math isn't difficult,  it's understanding how it leads to the theory that requires a lot of  thinking.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the theory  of relativity from Einstein's approach. However the reader should have a  minimum of understanding of the theory before attempting to read this book."

Not only did the brilliant Einstein envision the theory of relativity, but he also felt compelled to inform non-scientists by writing this \"less\" technical explanation of his theory. The book's section on Special Relativity is not too difficult to grasp. However, having some basic understanding of algebra and classical mechanics is helpful. On the other hand, the section on General Relativity is quite profound, requiring the reader to imagine new concepts of space and time that are alien to one's sense of reality. Indeed, I had to read this section several times and I'm still not sure if I completely understand it. However, this is more of a function of my imagination skills rather than Einstein's literary abilities. For he uses an abundance of familiar terms and analogies to simplify the understanding of some of the more \"unusual\" implications of General Relativity. I would not recommend this book to someone averse to technical subjects. However, I do recommend it to those wishing to learn the basics of relativity theory."

I was actually looking for a more mathematical exposition on these subjects, especially on General Relativity. There is almost no mathematics in this book. However, I was very pleased with it, because the explanations are so clear and easily understood. Einstein hits the mark on teaching the basics underlying his phenomenal theories, and, according to him, he leads us through this exploration in the same order in which he himself conducted his investigations. If you want to find out more about these subjects, you won't be disappointed in this book."

If you are a student or technical person that wants more of a \"plain text\" supplement to a technical course or presentation, then read this book. I read it many, many years ago when I was 14, and it had a profound effect on my outlook from that point onward. I labored over several topics sometimes for a week, but then, I was 14! When I finally finished it - I read it again! My point is that the text is well written, the concepts are at times a bit difficult to grasp, but the explanations are very understandable, and if you understand basic algebra, then what little math there is - a few equations essentially - will be quite clear. The main reason I even suggest the algebra is to better understand the relationships expressed within those equations. Bottom line - it is an excellent and \"gentle\" introduction to relativity and definitely worth reading! Enjoy."

Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than high-school knowledge of the relevant subjects. Maybe this was true in his time, but nowadays the book demands way more than that. I'm myself a grad student in the field of literature and I simply couldn't follow the presumably basic mathematical demonstrations Einstein relies upon to make his points. Some concepts are also less than obvious for the non-specialist ('galilean coordinates'?). This is not to say that the book itself is not good, but that it is targeted at a readership which is not necessarily trained enough to benefit from it."

But you probably won't get much out of it unless you've got a basic understanding of classic (i.e. Newtonian) physics, e.g. action/reaction, inertia of rest/motion, gravity, etc., and high-school level math (fairly simple algebra, incl square roots but not quadratic equations).  But that's not asking a lot.  With that you'll get through Special Relativity OK.  (Although weeks later you may find yourself thinking, \"Now run it by me again how the Speed of Light relates to billiard balls, and how in heck Mr. Einstein figured that out?  Guess I need to reread it.\")  General Relatively is a trickier kettle of fish, which took A.E. an additional decade to come up with.  YMMV, w/r/to understanding that (having read Hawking's \"Time\" helps).  I highly recommend this book, in any case."

There might have been a plain English explanation that is slightly more crisp, however, would you not want to read it from the master himself?  The special relativity section is especially clear, and detailed.  Almost all the important ideas were explained well there.  The section on general relativity is rather brief, and gives you the sense that it is just a flavor, not the full story.  Yet it gives you enough to be very interested.  The English translation from German could be better, but it really does not make it inexplicable.  Those who complain that the translation could not be understood probably would not understand the book even if it is translated better.  All in all, I would recommend reading it after some other exposition on the subject.  After that, this is an excellent piece of food for thought."

I haven't encountered another one as good as this. Contrary to widespread misconception, Albert Einstein was not an exceptionally expert mathematician. His justly deserved fame rests on the fact that he had an incredible intuition for physics, and a willingness to think the unthinkable whenever that seemed to be where the physics led. So it's not surprising that he could explain both the concepts of special relativity and those of general relativity in clear, simple language suitable for the non-technical reader. The result is a masterpiece, especially the discussion of general relativity."

They thought many of the sparking were stars; but in reality they were whole galaxies. With that view he projected other theories about space travel that were in error.

I will probably go one step further now and read a more contemporary presentation of his theories (facts)."

The theory is pushed so hard in some quarters that any contrary thoughts are simply quashed.  The special theory, especially the thought that their is no such thing as absolute space, is, in my view, simply wrong.  Many have written on this subject, for instance the Australian, Builder, but they are ignored by establishment science, which is not science at all but rather politics, and dirty politics at that.  That is not to say the Einstein was like that, but rather those who support his theory for political reasons."

The concepts I can understand, ONLY because I had other sources to explain them to me before buying this book. The problem is that he uses excessively long sentences which frequently jump around. More often than not, I get completely lost before the end of the sentence. Another problem is the fact that the language is somewhat flowery. (**Imagine for a second, trying to understand the topic of relativity with the indirect, flowery language that Shakespeare used---this book is not that poetic, but it's just as indirect. Physics, in general is simply not the place to be indirect, especially when attempting to explain a complicated subject in a way that's comprehensible.) He doesn't seem to make even remotely simple statements. Instead, the meanings of the sentences are watered down, and because of their excessive length (*I read a single sentence that was 6 lines in length), I get lost. I would not recommend this book to anyone other than Einstein himself, and if it is necessary for you to read this book (for school or personal accomplishment), for your own sake, keep a LARGE bottle of Asprin, and one of those ten-pound unabridged dictionaries near-by. >>Instead of this book, I would recommend \"Black Holes, Wormholes, and Time Machines\" by Jim Al-Khalili (It's very easy to understand, though covers complex topics...and I, personally, could not put it down.)"

                "Text": "Einstein's explanation of special relativity left me feeling warm and fuzzy, but when he moved on to the general theory, things took a turn for the worse. I'll be the first to admit that a failure of information flow from Einstein to me is most likely a problem on the receiving end. However, in this case, Einstein completely left out important parts of the theory. It was as if he tried to explain a bicycle by describing the front wheel. Perhaps he felt that explaining the whole bicycle without leveraging concepts from elsewhere in physics and math was not possible. That may be true, but it doesn't change the fact that reading this book isn't going to give you a very clear understanding of the general theory of relativity."

I thoroughly enjoyed the abridged audio novel and was very happy that I could share it with my 18 month old son who  gets to listen to it to as one of his bedtime stories.  I would like to  encourage Audio Scholar to produce more of these types of edutainment audio  programs on tape or CD. I love listening to scientific books on  my way to work and also love to share them with my 18 month old son as his  bedtime stories.  Actually I initially started buying them for my son and  then got hooked on them myself.  Now we both get to enjoy high quality  educational entertainment!  In addition the high level of clear  announciation in the Audio Scholar work is fantastic, it really helps my  son to learn new words, concepts and the organization of the english  language.  More than he would ever obtain in normal everyday speech. I do not have time in my busy daily schedule to read very much, but do I have five  hours a day to listen and learn. If you make it I will support it. Arnold D  Veness"

He mixed up  [seeing by the observer] with [occurrence at the origin]. Therefore  Einstein had no right to say that the two events did not occur  simultaneously when the observer did not [see] them simultaneously. Let us  say, we saw an explosion(A) of a star in 1998, and it was recorded that  there was another explosion (B) many years ealier. An observer on earth  could only say that he saw B earlier and A later; he could not say B  exploded earlier and A later; nor could he say B and A did not explode  simultaneously. Einstein's demonstration of his relativity of simultaneity  was therefore neither convincing nor fundimentally sound.  Einstein's  language problem could also be seen in his free switch between the words  [clock] and [time]. A clock may and can slow down, but can time slow down?  Unless we get this language problem cleared up I believe Einstein's theory  will remain controversial."
