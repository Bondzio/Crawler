That person seems to have missed the point. As for accuracy, it all makes sense, physical principles applied to humorous situations. Even my non-physics friends laugh at it. Highly recommend."

Crazy right? A potentially in depth and interesting book if you enjoy physics but I imagine annoying for someone who has never taken a physics class."
