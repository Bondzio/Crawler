                "Text": "It is a shame that this nice workbook has so many errors in the solution sets. Unlike the Schaum 3000 problems this workbook can be easily used to teach yourself basic physics.  All that is needed is a basic knowledge of algebra. No calculus needed. It is not expensive to proof a book like this. You find a needy grad student and they will do it for a resonable amount. It should be assumed that even under the best of circumstances that errors will occur. However, this workbook has too many. It is a shame because the author teaches well. It is a shame to mystify a student because the wrong answer is in the solution set. Please redo this workbook."

Also many other typos; for example in one line it reads 2.45 cm in one inch, in the next line it reads 2.54 cm in one inch. It doesnt seem like a big deal until you are wracking your brains wondering if you did something wrong or if it was simply another typo. The content and delivery is good, but considering this is simply a workbook it probably should have been edited better."

Also, I expected it to have a lot more problems, and more problems that were more comprehensive.  I will say, with due credit, if you work the problems diligently, it does help to give you a basic foundation to build on in an introductory physics course.  However, don't rely on your ability to work these problems to enable you to work more complex problems that you're presented with in a college level course.  Overall, the workbooks ok, but it really needs some overhauling--definetely needs proofreading and corrections made."
