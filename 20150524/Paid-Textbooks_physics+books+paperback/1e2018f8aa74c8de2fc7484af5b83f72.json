The author actually makes available for free a big part the book, but if you need all of it, the best thing is to just purchase it."

The progression through topics is intuitive.  It is very helpful that the author has a set of online supplemental materials available (eg sample code).  Concepts are taught so that they can be applied to other programming languages with ease."

                "Text": "Four Stars for the excellent introduction to Python (+NumPy+MatPlotLib).  It loses the 5th star only because loading a working copy of the full library package took a week of intense digging through obscure (to me) Python community developer websites which were less than friendly to the Python newbie.  I'm on a fairly new 64-bit HP EliteBook 8770w running Windows 7.  Finally found a workable combination of beta-test library modules in one place, and an 8-step loading procedure summary buried deeply in a user forum on another site.  In all it took 14 builds to get one fully-functional Python+NumPy+MatPlotLib package.  Guess I learned something from it but it took a lot of dogged determination.  Now with a working software package I'm halfway through the book and learning a lot much less painfully.  This is a fantastic step forward in programming tools for numerical design & analysis.  And it's all free if you can charge your time off to training.  In my toolbox this will be my preferred environment for going beyond MathCAD and controlling threading in modern 4-Core CPU's for 3-D transient magnetohydrodynamic modeling. - Don Cott, Thermal Systems Engineering, Anchorage, AK"

I am only about halfway through this book but feel that it has really helped me learn both Python programming and solid numerical analysis skills. My only warning is that without a strong physics background the examples and problems may be a bit opaque, but with a strong physics background this book does an excellent job of connecting the physics with computational techniques."

My only gripe is that it completely blows off object oriented principles and their benefits which is a crime.  You will want to learn more about OO for larger scale and maintainable applications as you do more.  Aside from that it is very well written and a pleasure to read and work with."
