                "Text": "This book is different. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in creating change in their lives. This book utilizes the latest cutting-edge quantum scientific discoveries to move the reader from a world of unfulfilled dreams to a world where literally anything is possible. The author will take the reader through all the fundamentals of quantum physics, but he does so in a way that anyone with a good grade school education will understand. Then he shows the reader how to use this science to achieve the reader's goals, and he does so in a way that truly stands out from almost all the other books out there that purport to help you to achieve your dreams. This book is well-worth your time and money. Go for it!"

It's clear he researched fields as diverse as physics and brain science but doesn't bore the reader by trying to sound like somebody with multiple PhDs. One does not have to be familiar with all the underlying science to see that the steps he promotes constitute a good strategic plan for reaching goals, even if one does not subscribe to the many worlds theory. However, since I subscribe to that theory, I was very happy to find a book I can share with friends and family to help provide them practical advice on how to achieve their dreams while also giving them an interesting lesson in one of my favorite topics."

Michel touches upon using your subconscious mind to get in touch with the aspect of your spirit that can help you to connect to your inner world either via dreams or other ways  where the answers to what you want to accomplish are already there. The author\u2019s message reminds me of the similar concept of quantum jumping by burt goldman. Anyhow,  there are some unique parallel world methods in this book such as stream of consciousness writing on page 103, guidelines for planting ideas in the subconscious (page 129), and viewing the world through the eyes of the person you will be upon arriving at your ideal parallel world (page 147), the subconscious and the next ideal frames (page 132), and the pathway to genius (page 133)."

This book actually provided an ask and it is given moment, as I was growing tired of reading similar books that all seemed to say the same things only in a different way. Mr. Michel's book introduced a lot of new ideas using quantum physics, metaphysics, and quotes from other teachers. The book repeats itself a bit too much in the middle, and the \"Next Ideal Frame\" portion could be condensed and tightened up a bit, but if you like books regarding metaphysics and would like some new and advanced ideas to chew on, this is a great book! Thank you, Mr. Michel."

Kevin did a good job, and this is a fantastic introductory book to the Many Worlds Theory. I am still intellectually hungry though."

It was getting to that next step that was overwhelming for me, and I suspect most other people.
