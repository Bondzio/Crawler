                "Text": "Professor Bleecker has succeeded in writing a book for  mathematicians and physicists.  And, it's all there.  I would rate this work 5-star, except I fear some physicists might find the mathematical format a bit tough (definition, theorem, lemma, etc.)  As a mathematician studying physics I hope I am wrong.  I find this book user-friendly due to its formality and \"compactness\".  I caution those w/o a fair degree of mathematical acumen that this big, little book is a good deal more formal than, say, Gilmore's \"Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Some of their Applications.\"  But, then we all must bite the bullet. With effort, I think you will find this a chewable bullet."

                "Text": "A useful reference text for gauge theory. While Bleecker includes an introductory chapter to cover prerequisites (tensor analysis, differential forms, Lie groups etc) the text assumes some familiarity with these techniques and gauge theory. The text is in the \"definition, theorem, proof\" format. Bleecker gives fairly detailed proofs which help the reader to follow most steps. The text is short and the price reasonable, so the absence of second quantization gauge potentials, for example, is perhaps understandable. While there are chapters on gauge invariance and Action density I found the material didn't go into the detail I was looking for on invariance problems (discussion of theorems of Noether, Caratheodory's methods, Lie algebras and groups). I rated this text lower because of the complete absence of exercises and the limited references and bibliography (about three pages in total)."
