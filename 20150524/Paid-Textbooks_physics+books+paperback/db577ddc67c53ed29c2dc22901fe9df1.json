I have two engineering degrees from 30 yrs ago, and my son is now taking this stuff, hence my renewed interest so I have help him with homework.  I gave the book 3 stars because I got the Kindle editio.  The only issue is that the formulas are microscopic in size  in the Kindle version.  A major defect in my opinoin.  You can't see them without tapping on them to open a window to enlarge them, and even then, sometimes they are still too small to read. Further, the tapping or double tap to open them frequently failed and merely advanced the pages in the book- mind numbingly frustratiing.  The content is good- buy the paper version."
