Besides the book, the seller I bought from took almost two months to get the book to me, ended up not having it for the first two weeks of my class and fell behind. Will never buy from this seller again."

For example, when presenting problems, they are phrased in order to pretend the physics applies to simple healthcare activities. One problem asks you to calculate the velocity of a falling aspirin tablet. What a useful thing to know in healthcare."
