For those used to a textbook style, this will be a bit of an unpleasant surprise, because writing is somewhat condensed, but that's quite typical for the old Russian school of theoretical physics. However, all the important issues are properly stressed, all derivations are rigorous, and what is most important, the physical reasoning is clear an to the point."

From the perspective of the time when it was written, it is complete and comprehensive, and following in the footsteps of the Russian theoretical school, the reader will need some amount of focus to follow the mathematical line of reasoning. The serious student will nevertheless have to supplement this book with a more modern follow-up - not Fetter/Walecka though, as Abrikosov deals with the formalism much better than F/W."
