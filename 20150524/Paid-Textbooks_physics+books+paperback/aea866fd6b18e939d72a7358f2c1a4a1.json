                "Text": "I used this book for a first year grad course in the calculus of variations some years ago. I found the book to be clear and pretty readable. I found the problem sets to be quite workable  and covered the material well. I liked the fact that there were answers to many of them. The book is more rigourous than the treatments of this subjects found in math methods books like arfken but it is not highly abstract. (a style found in many  math books at this level, and more difficult for me, not a  professional mathematician, but a scientist) In fact I have found this quality to be a characteristic of most of the russian applied mathematics books translated by Richard Silverman, many  of which are now published by Dover. This practical, clear, and rigourous approach of these books is excellent and I think almost all of these books on Dover have found their way onto my shelves."

                "Text": "Readable books on Calculus of Variations are hard to come by, if not non-existent. This is one of the clearest and most readable and self-contained books in the topic. I used it in a fourth year course at Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada. This is an introductory book meant for undergraduates and it is very well suited for this level. I strongly recommend that all serious students in Physics, Chemistry, engineering, and computing science to take a serious look at the book as a starting point in studying this most underated and relevant topic as a necessary mathematical foundation. Virtually all fundamental laws of Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering have their origins from some form of variational prinicples. If anyone is interested in pursuing this topic, this should definitely be the first book one should read. The student should be equipped with at least one introductory course in Real Ananlysis in order to start studying Variational Calculus. Otherwise, the readable may not find this book readable. Just a practical (cook-book) style applied mathematics course in Calculus and Differential Equations is inadequate as preparation to study this topic. I most sincerely congratulate the author in having done such a superbly well organized job in writing such a highly readable book in this challenging and important topic."

I came across this one, and after reading its first 4 chapters in continuation, I kow I don't need any other book. What a treat! Written by a past master, the book costs you next to nothing; yet as it's written by sure hand, it hasn't slightest pretention, just plain and insightful, natural and smoth flow, leads you almost effortlessly fowward. Even though I learned the subject before, I don't know of or even imagine a better exposition. Wow, I started to love Russian mathematicians."

Originally a Russian  textbook, it offers an excellent overview of the theoretical background for  the field without real heavy mathematics. All that is required is knowledge  of calculus  and a little ODE/PDE. Many classical examples, has an  introduction to applications such as analytical mechanics, optimal control  theory and approximate solution methods. The last edition I am aware of is  pretty old, so this book should be tough to come by. A new edition would be  welcome, with more examples and other applications."

The book is also nicely paced, arriving at the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Noether's theorem fairly early on. I also appreciated the final section on variational problems involving multiple integrals. In short, this is a concise, readable book and I believe the best introduction to the subject. The one complaint I have is that the problems (perhaps added by the translator) are not at the level of the text. They are too often just number fiddling instead of real proofs."
