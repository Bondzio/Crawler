                "Text": "This physics textbook by Michael Dickinson is a huge asset when teaching or learning IB physics.  The diagrams are incredibly helpful for conceptual understanding.  Many of the examples are exactly like what the students will see on upcoming IB exams.  I have taught IB physics for 6 years, and have previously spent a great deal of time having students write out definitions and draw diagrams.  Some of that was helpful, but students can also use this book as pre-written notes, and spend more of their time discussing concepts and practicing tough problems.  While the black and white version is good, I would recommend the color version more.  Many diagrams, especially those in the waves unit that relate to light, need the color to get their meaning across more."
