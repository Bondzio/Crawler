                "Text": "Kumar's book on the history of early twentieth century physics and atomic theory skips from page to page, fleshing out scientific expanations with vivid descriptions of the key protagonists. It is a real skill to make sophisticated scientific theories accessible to the lay person, but Kumar's use of metaphor helps bring the most intangible concepts to life.  This is a modern classic, but more important, a really fun read."

                "Text": "Modern Education have been conducted in a way that the philosophical ideas behind the great theories discussed in Physics have been kept away from the standard curriculum at universitats. This book belongs to the few one I have found to be interested (I'm speaking as a Theoretical Physicist) because it not only develops the historical frame in which the theory was created (the base of the theory), but also the debates, the ideas that came first and evolved in the way. All of this discussed in a way that keeps you in the book for hours without you even knowing it. Even if you are an already mastered in the area of the Quantum Physics, or if you are starting it, this book will help you understand many of the \u00a8why\u00a8 we are always asking. This book can make an excellent supplementary lecture for any student in quantum theory, because it fills the gaps that modern textbooks leave to the students that do not understand why is necessary the change in the classical theory, and how it is made. Quantum Theory is not a complete theory, it still have many holes and weak points upon which the theory is develop, for those interested in research the base of the theory, this book can help you refresh your mind from all the heavy reading and give you a clearer perspective."

                "Text": "The practical success of quantum mechanics has enabled today's information-based economy in much the same way as the harnessing of steam did for the industrial revolution. The pioneers for both were few in number and whose long shadows were quickly covered by practitioners' incremental improvements accumulated to far reaching and long lasting impact on society's material culture. But quantum mechanics contains a paradox that is profoundly intellectual and with disturbing metaphysical aspects that are still not resolved to this day. This well written book details quantum mechanic's early history and background, from Max Plank's almost accidental discovery of an analytical method that explained what were then considered minor details in physics, including the birth of theoretical physics that coincided with the collapse of classical physic's explanation of the material universe as then understood, and, not least, the clash of two giants, Einstein and Bohr and their differing worldviews, as the paradox appeared and deepened when evolving analytical and manipulative skills became more powerful. Fast paced and much like a mystery with several levels of narrative. One of the most notable is the fact that the cast of characters and their work was extremely small, unknown and unheralded until Einstein became an international celebrity. Another is the power of imagination, long before science was spelled with a capital S, through the famous thought experiments made famous by Einstein, that brought understanding based on mathematical reasoning and without needing experimental proof. The players' egos, foibles, follies and insightful flashes also are part of the story, and how they sorted themselves into two camps reflecting the two opposing world views that provide the crux of the paradox. Einstein profoundly and deeply believed in the independent existence of the material universe, while Bohr held just as profoundly and deeply that there is no absolute reality beyond what can be conjured by observation. This highly readable book covers not just some physicists' quibbles, but the vista to our understanding of the universe as we comprehend it, from the unimaginably physically small realm of quantum mechanics to the seemingly limitless vastness of the cosmos."

                "Text": "Trying to understand, as a non-physicist, the theories of twentieth century physics is a challenging task, even after high and college physics courses have provided an introduction to the terms and concepts.  This book is not only readable but enjoyable.  The secret to its success is its historical approach, presentation of the principal characters as interesting human beings, and the understandable language.  The subject matter is the non-intuitive quantum physics.  The text requires concentration from the reader, but rewards with a drama that contains the lives of famous and important scientists and the concepts and theories that are part of our lives, whether we want them or not.  If you have the desire to understand what is being debated about the nature of \"reality\" in the scientific and philosophic worlds, this is probably the best single book on the subject.  The author is to be congratulated on the effort and success of this enterprise."

However, after many years that I am not doing science any more, this book brought back happy memories on why I have chosen to study physics in the first place. It is now my favourite book both on the history of discovery of quantum mechanics and on the question of interpretation. The lives nad works of famous scientists are given in vivid detail that greatly helps to understand the scientific developments, and at the same time makes this book a great read!"

A genius approach, beginning with Planck and his creation of the word \"quanta.\" By following the lives and thought of each of the great thinkers in this field, I was able to get a deeper and deeper grasp of the issues. Finally, the unfinished argument between Einstein and Bohr came to the front as the uniting thread. I'm stone dumb on math, but this was a great read, even for a mathaphobe."

                "Text": "\"Does the moon exist only when you look at it ?\" asked Einstein.  This forms the central philosophical battle that Manjit Kumar's book traces through the history of the quantum from 1900 until today.  On one side is Einstein, the cultural icon who also happens to be perhaps the greatest Physicist of all time and on the other side is Bohr, a physics icon who among the inner circle may be of equal stature.  Einstein could not believe in a world without the realism that seems to be true in the macro world but Bohr felt nature is as the quantum describes it - probabilistic, non deterministic and most importantly dependent on an observer.  Joining them in battle are the great physicists of the 20th century whose names live immortalized as constants, measures, principles and equations.  Kumar mixes in equal parts biography making this an interesting read beyond the science.  Although much has been learned since 1900 and so much of our man-made material lives are a result of the understanding these individuals gained from the quantum world we still cannot really answer Einstein's question.  We are all made of quantum stuff and believe in our reality and determinism but all that we are made of does not seem to follow these rules.  A wonderful journey through a mind boggling world."

As I layman, I find this topic deeply engrossing, so I've read 6 or 7 books and will surely read more on this. This is one of the better ones I've come across. The author weaves a fascinating account of the major scientists at quantum's core, and the cooperation and rivalry amongst them: Planck, Bohr, Shrodinger, Einstein, Heisenberg, Pauli, and quite a few others. The genius of these men is awe-inspiring and humbling. Each development in quantum is covered, who worked with whom, the brilliant speeches and symposiums, and the countless one on one talks into the night, which sometimes pitted genius against genius as each seemed to have his own deeply felt inherent insight and direction. Those great years were peppered with amazing breakthroughs. I just love reading the nicely told and exciting stories of  how each important breakthrough came about. And then, of course, the ensuing debates about what the experiments really showed. After all, classical physics can lead one awfully astray in the strange world of the quantum! I highly recommend this book, and can't wait to finish it so I can read it again!"

Manjit goes into account after account relating the discoveries and interactions among the likes of Einstein, Bohr, Born, Pauli, Heisenberg (the real one not the Breaking Bad guy) Planck, Bohm, in short just about anyone who had something to say about physics in the 20th century. At the center of the book's theme is the tension between Bohr and his team's Copenhagen Interpretation where the Quantum is all and Einstein's lingering feelings that there is something more at work that would allow complete understanding of the mechanics of the micro-atomic world. It will leave your head spinning in a good way - but I'm not really sure if the spin is up or down. If only I could measure it with accuracy :-) Thanks for a great book Manjit."

Manit Kumar is a terrific narrator, taking what could be a very dry, pedantic topic and breathing life into it. Much has changed since Einstein and Bohr's time, the foundation laid down by these scientists made it possible to explain phenomenon such as black holes, mesons, quarks, string theory, and more."

I needed a condensed, layman's guide to the theories that shaped the modern world, and this book is it. The science comes alive with clear and understandable descriptions, but even more interesting perhaps are the fascinating personal histories of the brilliant men and women who thought about the nature of matter and reality.  A very enjoyable journey."

This book enunciates how true scientists should behave, where evidence, experimentation (thought  or practical),  intelligent discourse, and most importantly of all peer review (as opposed to journalistic mumblings and political comment) are the stock in trade. Should be compulsory reading for anyone doing undergraduate science as part of their scientific methods and logic subjects."

What I liked about this one is that Kumar shows the development of the idea of quantum physics step by step.  He traces an understandable history of the idea; he gives the reader information about the major players and where each person fits into the historical timeline.  But more than anything else, he makes the debate very clear.  One side (Einstein and Schroedinger) wants to preserve the real world behind the physics that they feel the theory needs to refer to or represent.  The other side in the debate (Bohr and Heisenberg) says that it doesn't matter if there is a reality behind the physics.  This account makes the philosophical question \"what is truth?\" come alive."

Although novice that I am - in the science world - this book sets forth the life and times of a group of the most renowned physicists the world had ever seen before or arguably since, with clarity and precision. In particular, the 1920s - which is primarily the focal point of this revolution - where recent discoveries had caused great debate among the greatest minds of the day, a great number with great minds - who were even popularly embellished with scientific stardom. After all, for example, the fact that light can be considered matter or a wave depending upon whether or not it is measured by an observer, tears at the very fabric of our classical understanding of Newtonian physics and the nature of the universe to shreds. That these physicists were so successful in bravely and tirelessly pursuing scientific truth in the face of newly found increasingly complex obstacles, is testament to their stark brilliance and the power of the human spirit. Of course, I'm referring to Plank, Einstein, Schrodinger, Born, Heisenberg and Bohr, among many other physicists and mathemeticians. A fascinatingly concise and coherent book - highly recommend this one."

I would have taken up physics as my major if I had this book 55 years ago, instead of biochemistry! Although I read this book in my Kindle, I bought a paperback to give to my grandson, who is a high school junior. This book is a must read for anyone with less understanding of physics but an appetite to really understand the fundamental reality of Being. I commend the author for writing this book."

But this book brings a whole new dimension to the topic. So no matter how much I've read or understand about these ideas, Kumar has assembled both public records and private correspondence to paint a picture of the development of the ideas and the personalities of the scientists that turn it into a tour de force of genius. He brings these scientists to life as real people whose life histories and fortuitous events played a role in how and when they had the brilliant insights that led to a revolution in how we understand reality. So no matter that some of the stories and events are familiar to me. So is chocolate. But I keep enjoying it each time."
