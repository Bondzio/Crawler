                "Text": "I normally do not read biographies, and I don't think I have read an autobiography since I was forced to read one in high school.  Most autobiographies are simply exercises in celebrating the successes of a great life.  I chose this one because Derman has always been a fascinating person.  One of the first physicists to make it big on Wall Street, he's best known as co-creator of the Black-Derman-Toy term structure model and the Derman-Kani volatility smile model.  I had read his finance research, some of his lighter reading, and had met him.  I knew he wasn't one to gloat.  This book delivers everything I expected.  Offering fascinating insights into the culture of organizations he has worked for, such as Goldman Sachs, Bell Labs, Salomon Brothers, and the crazy world of academic physics, Derman takes us on an exciting trip through a career that parallels the emergence of finance as a scientific discipline on both Wall Street and in academia.  What fascinated me the most is how he describes his achievements in very modest terms, carefully explaining what he discovered but without trying to make you think that his findings changed all life on earth from that point forward.  And he is remarkably candid about his mistakes, which humanize this book in a way rarely seen when someone is telling their personal story.  If you're interested in finance, physics, academia, or you'd just like to read an autobiography the way it ought to be written, this book is for you."

                "Text": "If you want to get an idea of what Physics PhDs might actually do at an investment bank, life as a physics graduate student, the intinerant life and pressures of the post-doc, this book is fascinating and informative.  The accounts of these variuos lives ring true -- for example, if you have ever been a graduate student in mathematics or physics (and are not absolutely brilliant), you likely will recognize the initial optimism, then creeping doubts, etc. that Derman describes so perceptively.  It is the life of the extremely talented, the very, very smart, but not quite having the Nobel Laureate physicist advisor, not quite Area 10 home of the Nobel Laureate economist at Bell Labs (Derman'smyth-dispelling descripton of life at Bell Labs is eye-opening), and not quite the Meriwether/LTCM group at Salomon.  There are wonderful descriptions of what research is like, both in academia and at investment banks, the difference between bank cultures, and a thought provoking explication of the difference between financial economics and physics and the roles of modelling in each.  And there is a good flavor of how one works a problem, both in physics and finance.  This book would have been useful (though perhaps not helpful in maintaining enthusiasm) and sobering to have read before graduate school.  Together with \"Inventing Money,\" my favorites on options and banking."

While anyone interested in either physics or quantitative finance will find his various thesis/projects quite an interesting read, the book really shines when it talks about his struggle with his Ph.D., shuttling between different cities in his post doc career and his life as a \"quant\" in investment banks.

Starting at Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS ) in 1985, he moved from fixed-income to equity derivatives to risk management, becoming a managing director in 1997. The most challenging part of this book is the author's detailed explanation of trading tools: For example, there's the formula for pricing options on Treasury bonds, which he co-invented with Goldman colleagues Bill Toy and the late Fischer Black. But My Life As a Quant is not all tough sledding: With references that range from Mother Goose to Goethe, it's an amusing tale of one man's unlikely experiences.\""

In about 2/3rd of the book Derman recounts his then boss' outburst on what the job of 'quant' entails - 'This job requires nothing more than addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. And, most of the times, you won't even require division'. Pleasant read, though a bit more leaning towards autobiography than to theory. The explanation on (a) 'Black-Scholes theory' and (b) how forecasting actual value of a Bond (will surely have a promised value) vs. Stocks with crisp graphs was a great takeaway, however."

It's the story that starts with a young emigre who commences on a journey in academia and eventually leads to the paths of programming and finance.  Even when he is speaking of techical terms, he writes with the grace of a story teller.  This finessese allows the reader to easily grasp complex concepts quite easily. Yes, the same theories that other quants (the pedantic ones) flounder to explain, are easily taught in this book.  This man is as great a writer as he is a scientist, as he is a Man.  Anyone can appreciate this book.  I highly recommend that it be added to any finance professional's library."

I think that you can get the same depressing story by talking to the post-doc students at your local university. This book did make me glad that I chose to become an engineer.

Readers without undergrad experience in math or physics will be lost at times as the author gets into his technical discussions.

Due to the imperfect nature of it and the fact that risk sometimes rears its ugly head despite all the efforts, it sometimes makes one wonder \"what's the point\" but at least folks like the author were incredibly well compensated for their efforts."

                "Text": "This excellent autobiography covers the emotional life of a thoughtful man. Emanuel Derman examines his conscience dispassionately and honestly, offering a sometimes poignant account of his descent from the world of pure science to the hustle of Wall Street. His memoir flows like a conversation, albeit with many tangents. You'll learn more than you want about personnel changes at his former firms, but you'll also gain rare insights into how Wall Street makes decisions, plus a few excellent points about the inadequacy of financial theory as science. Derman's descriptions of options theory and financial models sometimes approach clarity, but may be far beyond the lay reader's understanding. We recommend this book to avid students of Wall Street and to any academic contemplating a move there. General readers who would enjoy Derman's reminiscences, and who do not mind tackling some dense scientific and financial material, will find an in-depth life story with moving reflections on the disparity between youthful ideals and mature compromises."

In the second half, he relates how he accommodated himself to the sentiment expressed in Alexander Pope's couplet -- \"I am His Majesty's dog at Kew; pray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?\" -- as an employee in the corporate world.  In the first half he writes openly about his feelings, family, and thoughts about life.  He becomes more circumspect when he gets to the part about his employment with Goldman, Sachs.  I'm not sure why this is.  He passes over 9/11 with hardly a comment about how this event affected him.  He writes well and I enjoyed his descriptions of people.  An example of his style: \"Everyone was disproportionately fearful of Downs.  He seemed to regard social intercourse as a competitive Olympic event, perfecting his own jiu-jitsu style of converstation that aimed to quickly unbalance his opponent.  He accomplished this by making aggressively oracular and cryptic statements on whatever topic was under discussion.\" But most readers are probably interested in his views on quantitative finance.  That was of lesser interest to me and over my head anyway."

It is quite clear that he is a failed physicist and he attempts to make amends throughout the entire reading by creating this illusion of financial brilliance cloaked behind a vale of obscurity.  More precisely, he makes clear the fact that models are virtual meaningless in a world where security valuation is a very esoteric science at best.  Yet, he rambles on through many chapters about his \"talks\", and \"successes\", in creating and presenting his financial models.  At no time in this book did I ever see him create a precise goal and stick to it.  He is unquestionably a dabbler who found that such a life style is not very conducive to physics, so why not try finance.  I am a firm believer that anybody can achieve anything with proper motivation, desire, and most imporatantly a clear goal and a plan for its attainment.  This man lacks all of these coupled with the fact that he is pompous and self-indulgent.  My goal is not to dissuade anyone from reading this book but please be prepared for a what I feel is a very lack luster read."

If your looking for a book with market trading tactics and think this book will provide that, then my score would be a \"1\"  Its not about how to make YOU money and its title implies that.  In fact, its title is a quite honest answer to what is inside, the reflections of this Quant on his life in physics and finance.  While he does not give the reader any CLEAR suggestions on how to make money in the market, he does give a good view of life as a professional in the hard sciences most of them would find it boring, the book would be a good  for some super high school achiever that is contemplating  or announced committment to a life as a PHd in hard science.  He does do a good job of relating all the \"posturing\", the \"idea stealing\", and general BS that is the real world of both science and commerce.  His descriptions of his finance modeling efforts and the difficulties does show why many big firms can go bust.  But other than messing up your own trading, you have to know when a big firm had bad Quant.  So, unless you can think beyond what your reading as to making money in the market and learning to make money is your goal, then pass on this book.  I gave it a \"3\" as it is good at exposing BS. More BS exposure type books may some day help us all.  But you won't find specific maket making money ideas in this book, thus no \"5\""
