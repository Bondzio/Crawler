                "Text": "This book, along with Paul Davies, The Goldilock's Enigma, are part of my rereading diet almost every day.  If I had read these books before I published my book, I would have referred to them because they hit on topics about information and consciousness that I consider to be vital to my personal growth.  I think any one wanting to graduate from materialistic thinking to more spiritual thinking will find this book invaluable.  I found John Haught's chapter, Information, theology, and the universe especially valuable.  He states what it takes to make meaningful information flow, i.e. enough, but not too much redundancy and novelty, consistent with a concept of evil as a bifurcated path of erroneous extremes on either side of the good.  I can see why the reviewers still mentally stuck in the mud of matter find the book hard to understand.  I recommend the book for any one ready to graduate from mind under matter to mind over matter."

I think another book titled \"Decoding the Universe\" by Charles Seife is a better read and more coherent."

Information has some technical meanings which are explored, while at the same time philosophers and physicists (scientists in general for that matter) have tried to make \"information theory\" the magic bullet that explains everything from the origins of the universe to the appearance of life and consciousness. Information theory is the latest fad in these disciplines. Nevertheless, while some of these applications are over-the-top, Davies and Gregersen have managed to snag an excellent stable of authors who are luminaries on the subject and the editing is superb! None of the papers is highly technical, and all make excellent reading if you are interested in the subject."
