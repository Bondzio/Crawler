While I find here and there a few pages that I can understand without too much stress, there are other parts that caused me to abort reading - symbol stack overflow. Why do I get the impression that others here may rate this as a five star book simply to express their (probably well deserved) pride to have understood some of it? It's more than just a little difficult to read this book. They call this an introduction?"
