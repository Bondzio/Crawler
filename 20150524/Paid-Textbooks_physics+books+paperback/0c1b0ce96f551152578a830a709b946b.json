                "Text": "Doing physics homework is rarely truly fun, but a good textbook can at least reduce the stress and confusion/frustration levels associated with working problems and learning material.  This book is basically what I said in the title:  Helpful, clear, and readable, which are three things that are essential in any informational book yet sadly lacking in so many physics textbooks.  Excellent book.  Also, there are amusing footnotes sprinkled throughout the text, including some anecdotes/commentaries on physics pillars such as Niels Bohr."

Nobody, whatever the background, can remain calm and disengaged with professor Griffiths unfolding the spectrum of particles. It is his exceptional talent to word his messages such that they find their way directly to the grey cells of the reader. So far, for my way of thinking, the best written book on topics of physics was \"The Fabric of the Cosmos\" by Brian Green. Now there is a second book on this shelve of \"most pleasure to read\": \"Introduction to Elementary Particles\" by David J. Griffiths"
