Great diagrams, clearly presented concepts, well paced....dirt cheap. It is organized just like a self paced course, with frequent quizzes and end of chapter tests. If you want to start off in astronomy with one excellent book, this would be the one. I just wish I had of discovered it years ago. I'm using the 5th edition. I would presume subsequent editions to be at least as good."
