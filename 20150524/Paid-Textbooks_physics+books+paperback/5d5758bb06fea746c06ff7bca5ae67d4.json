                "Text": "This was NOT the textbook. This was a thin paper back packet of the tests for the physics book. There is nowhere on the advertisement that states that this is a test booklet. It only states that it is a hard cover, which I thought implies a book. My search also included \"Saxon Physics BOOK\". It was not for the test booklet. It was for the text. The picture and the name listed matched the textbooks picture and name. I don't understand. I do not feel I errored. And now the stores wants me to repackage it and send back for a full refund and not for the replacment of the book. I feel that they mislead me. They asked an inexpensive price and I bit. I'm annoyed and unhappy with the misrepresentation."
