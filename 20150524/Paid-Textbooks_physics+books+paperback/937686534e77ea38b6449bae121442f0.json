                "Text": "I purchased this solutions manual with the hopes of practicing all of the problems at the end of each chapter in the College Physics text book--unfortunately, this solutions manual doesn't provide ANY answers to the conceptual or multiple choice problems.  Instead, it only provides answers to SOME of the odd numbered problems, and these answers are already provided in the back of the College Physics text book (although not with as much detail as the solutions manual).  Doesn't this defeat a good portion of the purpose of a solutions manual?"

I am halfway through physics 2 and have used this manual maybe 2 times between both Physics 1 and 2.  It just doesn't have the problems I need and the problems I did need help with (that were included in this manual) were explained  in a way I do not find helpful.  Go to chegg. Your money will be much better spent getting access to the solutions there."

That's sort of the point of a solutions manual, teaching you how to solve the problems you're having difficulty with step-by-step when you can't get to your professor. I'd pay more for a complete manual. What the hell is wrong with you authors?"
