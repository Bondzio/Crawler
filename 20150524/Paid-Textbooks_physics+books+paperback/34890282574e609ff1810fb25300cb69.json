I believe that a solution manual should have 50% of the problems. This book had about 25% of the problems. Example- Chapter One problems: 3, 7, 11, 13, 21, 23, 25, 31, 35, 39, 43, 45, 53, 59, 63, 65 (16/69) = 23%. This is a tough subject, so it may benifit some to buy."

I bought it for my Pysics 1211 or II for my summer classes we have finished 6 chapters 6 - 7 weeks so far, the Professor asign HW about 10 - 20 questions for a chapter all what i got from the manual solution is only one question.
