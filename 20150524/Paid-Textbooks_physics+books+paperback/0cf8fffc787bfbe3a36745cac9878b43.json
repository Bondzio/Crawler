                "Text": "It usually scares the bleep out of me when a physicist attempts history.  Purrington is a  major exception.  PHYSICS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY perfectly fills a void in the history of physics, and the intellectual growth of America and Europe.  It's a compulsive read-read it  straight through without putting it down once.  I know of no better book dealing with the intellectual 'threads' of the growth of physics. Purringtons' writing is clear, crisp, and to the point.  A good book has exactly the right number of words.  This book has exactly the right number."
