My professor doesn't speak English so I'm teaching myself, the problem is the mastering physics homework doesn't explain anything if you get it wrong or show you how to do the problems, and not every problem comes with a hint. You get -3% each time you submit a wrong answer. Take a good professor- this book is Terrible."

The text goes into explaining some of the basic theories/laws/principles etc., and helps explain a few of the ways that you can apply what you've just read, but then these crazy questions come out of nowhere that you end up getting assigned for homework that leave you utterly confused. They're extremely difficult, and you won't even know where to start. If you're anything like me, after buying this book, you're going to spend a significant amount of time on Yahoo answers."
