The only reason I did not give it a five is that it only has a selected number of problems instead of them all.  The ones it has are explained quite well.  If your professor dosen't give you a solution then this is the next best thing to get a answer."

The author may have some master degrees so his solutions are usually complicated and hard to follow :) Most of the time, I just use it to check the answers."

                "Text": "I bought this when I was talking the second course in the physics series, so these comments refer to the chapters of the book referring to electricity and magnetism. I felt like the solutions manual was not helpful in any way. In addition to not having all of the answers (it seems to skip around, answering only those questions that it wants to), it also skips steps here and there, which is enough to make it difficult to keep up. I found looking up the answers online more useful than using this book."

                "Text": "I ordered this book for my daughter for her college course.  I looked it up using the ISBN number.  It looks like the same book in the pic, but the ISBN number on the cover is different.  It also included the \"mastering physics student access kit\" which is necessary for registering for the online materials that go along with this course.  It was shrink wrapped so I know it was new and unused, but the access code inside did not work.  When we tried to enter the code at the site, it said the code was expired.  My daughter was told she could pay another $55 to get an unexpired code!  I ended up having to call the book company.  At first I was told the code was expired and I'd have to return the book to Amazon and get a one with a new unexpired code!  Of course I told them that was totally ridiculous, so after  talking to about 4 different representatives someone reactivated our code so it would work."
