I turned to amazon.com to see more choices and ordered this book.  I am so happy.  I love this book and can hardly put it down.  Things are making sense now.  I just wish I had this book before I started the semester.  Thank you Mr. Lehrman.  If I could hug you, I would!"

I initially checked this book out from my local library as I was interested in gaining a better grasp of basic physics.  While there are many books on physics out there, this goes along the core concepts and math nicely, with each chapter focusing on more specific facets of the big picture.  The copy I ordered was $.01 and listed as \"Acceptable\" condition, which it was.  I'll note that, without a proper definition of \"Acceptable\" it's hard to know what to expect. The one I received had a single crack along the spine, slightly worn corners and notes/highlighted text throughout.  I don't mind it at all, and I kind of enjoy having key info noted already. I believe if you're merely trying to expand your understanding of Physics and not presenting this as a gift, \"Acceptable\" should be just fine."

Another example is \"try me\" #6 in Chapter 2.  6.0 seconds - 2.0 seconds = 4 seconds, but the answer uses 3 elapsed seconds.  The simple presentations are indeed, \"The easy way\".  I bought this because I own \"Calculus, the easy way\", which is excellent 5 stars."
