I will say that the 75 pages that I read so far are excellent, clearly defining the subject matter and follow a comprehensive learning curve. So far I like the course big time."

Feynman had one of the clearest understandings of physics of anyone in the 20th century, and it shows in this book.  This is well worth reading, if you are interested in the subject.  It's like a dessert tray, for me."
