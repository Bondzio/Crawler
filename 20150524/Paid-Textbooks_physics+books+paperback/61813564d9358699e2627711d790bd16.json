                "Text": "I used this text in a tutorial with a distinguished philosopher of science at Queens College, New York. It's outstanding. The mathematical formalism is difficult for non-specialists, but no so much as to be out of reach. Advice: be patient--the understanding will come. The part on the interpretation of QM is exceptionally valuable to anyone interested in understanding modern physics without falling for dishonest notions like \"quantum healing\", \"quantum chi\", and \"quantum dieting\". In short: if you're a serious student, this is probably the best book of its kind."

                "Text": "R.I.G. Hughes'  book is one of the most original introductions to non relativistic quantum mechanics. It gives to us an actual,didactic, and balanced overview of the main foundational problems in the field; in addition, the book offers a personal analysis of the subject. I strongly recommend it to philosophers, physicists, and any person really interested in quantum mechanics. It, in fact, constitutes an important complement to the contents of the usual textbooks on quantum mechanics."

The instant I came across  Hughes' book, I recognized it for the treasure it is. This is not only the  best book ever written, but also the best book that ever will be written."

The contents are balanced and understandable for even a high-school student, which usually is not expected from a great thinker like Hughes.  The book making is good as well -- cover design, editing, binding, etc.  An interesting and decent treatment of quantum physics.  Probability a must for any phys and math thinker.

                "Text": "I bought this text when I was first interested in learning the math behind quantum mechanics. I was attracted to the exposition of the mathematical formalism of spin. That part of the book did not disappoint. But the remainder was almost unreadable: longwinded, pretentious pontifications on the \"meaning\" of quantum mechanics. The author could have saved many pages by substituting the following: \"I really don't know what the \"meaning\" of quantum mechanics is\". No shame there. As Richard Feynman once said: \"Nobody understands quantum mechanics.\" And he should know."
