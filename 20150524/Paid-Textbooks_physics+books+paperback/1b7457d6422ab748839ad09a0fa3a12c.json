If the science is what intrigues you, look elsewhere.  This is not a science-for-the-public book like those written on Evolution by Richard Dawkins or on language by Steven Pinker."

This book also made my head spin and nearly explode, but it's from truly grasping the difficult physics idea of dark energy in a decidedly non-mathematical manner.

                "Text": "This book is written by a skilled, experienced journalist.  It adds a dramatic flair to the developments in cosmology and astrophysics that have led to consensus views about the universe and the nature of reality.  The reader gets an insight into the personas of influential scientists and the political nature of scientific institutions.  The main drawback to this book is that it focuses on the shifting consensus in this field while failing to explore other ideas that challenge the dominant notions.  It ignores scientists who have exposed flaws in beliefs about red shift and the big bang and doesn't examine the ramifications of quantum theory and metaphysical ideas, which could offer better explanations for things that some attempt to address with dark matter and dark energy.  In science it's common for inaccurate assumptions to form the foundation of theorizing and research.  This book offers an engaging look at developments in these areas of investigation but it looks at only a small slice of ideas and evidence pertaining to the subject matter.  It doesn't question assumptions that truly do need to be questioned.  Thus, it may intrigue and stimulate the mind of the reader while leaving the reader still rather ignorant about what is being discovered about \"reality\" via multiple disciplines.  Thus, for style this book is a solid effort and a pleasant read, but I can't recommend it for those seeking a really advanced, more accurate understanding of the universe."

                "Text": "The 4 Percent Universe begins as a very concise description of the problems and discoveries of earlier cosmology (how the cosmic background radiation was discovered, Einstein's cosmological constant, etc.) and then focuses on two teams that used different approaches to end up with the announcement of dark matter/dark energy.  The style is quick-paced and clear, highly informative and easy to follow without feeling overly dumbed down. It's a great example of popularized science.  My only personal quibbles with the book are that sometimes I thought it focused a bit too much on the scientist themselves to the detriment of the science (or if not to the detriment of the science to the detriment of the book's concision and efficiency) and that at times the listing of dueling press releases became a bit of a blur.  In other words, in the latter quarter or so I felt the book lost a bit of its focus on the science and wandered a bit too much in the forest of personalities of those trying to do the science.  I acknowledge, however, that some will find that such a choice humanizes the science more and makes the book more of an entertaining narrative.  But save for that small complaint, I found the book a great science read. It did a nice job of placing discoveries in scientific and historical context, was detailed without overloading the reader, explained issues clearly and concisely, and was nicely up to date.  Strongly recommended for the clarity and concision with a small complaint that it focused a bit too much on individual personalities toward the end."

                "Text": "The 4% universe is part of a host of new books of physics, quantum physics, and the respective specialties that are within each discipline.  There are now many books dedicated to these specialized areas, but most have the typical summary of classical physics, the new physics, and then the author makes finally makes their point.  For example, the book Massive--a fantastic book--is dedicated to the Higgs Boson and Higgs field.  There are also many books, new and old, dedicated to the issues of 'dark matter' and 'dark energy.'  This book does have some of the typical background, which is a good thing which, including many clear examples such as descriptions of \"brane\" universes, the meaning of 'nothing' in physics and measuring cosmic distances.  I would have given this book 3-stars, but for the fact that it is well written, it has a logical flow, and there are many great examples of the new physics.  The problem, however, and this may be due to the fact that a Wikipedia article can summarize both topics in one article, is that the 4% universe is more about the people (or two main teams) behind the discovery that we can only see 4% of \"ordinary matter.  That is to say, given the extensive reviews above, the main complaint is that the book should have been labeled The Race to Discover the Rest of Reality, because there is an overemphasis on the teams involved in the race to reality.  In other words, the books main defect--and I am not the only one to notice--is that there is too much emphasis on what each team is doing, their respective competitions.  If you are a physicist, then you would want this book for your personal library as it deals with many of the people behind the scenes.  I read every page (there is much repetition, which is good for learning), but the emphasis was largely unpacked like a class action biography on many people and their respective teams.  There is enough knowledge to exhaust all there is to know about dark matter and dark energy, so you will not be wasting your money.  But, you could lose focus given the author's focus."

He covers the race to discover reality between a group of physicists and astronomers, which in the process birthed the science of cosmology. Read the epilogue first. In there on page 242 Panek says, \u201cIn early 2010 . . . the results arrived bearing the latest refinements of the numbers that define our universe. It was 13.75 billion years old . . . . it was flat, consisting of 72.8 percent dark energy, 22.7 percent dark mater, and 4.56 percent baryonic matter (the stuff of us) \u2013 an exquisitely precise accounting of the depth of our ignorance. The astronomers who set out to write the final chapter in the history of the universe had to content themselves instead with a more modest conclusion: to be continued.\u201d Isn't it amazing? We don't know what dark energy and dark matter are, and they compose most of our universe. Of course, we now have to think about parallel universes and multi-verses. Brian Greene's new book The Hidden Reality addresses these, and I recommend following up with it."

We are able to infer only 4% of known reality because Dark Matter and Dark Energy are unknowable with our current limits of perception, - - - in other words, with all known extensions of our senses thru telescopes, radio telescopes, the complete gamut of sensory extensions, we cannot know the substances that we now call Dark Matter and Dark Energy by any means currently available except thru reasoned inference about its volume, mass and effect. We know only that it exists -- but we can't perceive its substance. Like trying to explain color to a blind man, or music to a deaf man. It surrounds us, passes thru us and challenges our ingenuity to even sense it - but we're beginning to under special conditions. We are Galileo seeing the vast new realms of the unknown."

The book covers one of the greatest mysteries facing science today, the universe's missing mass. Modern cosmology has two groups of scientist working (the astronomers and the physicists) to solve this puzzle. Both are very different in how they work and how they think. But the answers that they hope to find will change the way we look at the universe forever! The book covers some very complex theories and concepts but Mr. Panek does a good job making the complex simpler to read and understand. I feel the book could have been improved by adding a few illustrations."

I'd say there's as much history/sociology coverage as science writing ... if you're interested in the group dynamics of astronomical researchers, or the balance between cooperation and competition in science, or the \"inner workings\" of how science really gets done in an environment of scarce resources (and when there's a Nobel prize on the line), this book is very interesting. If you're not very interested in delving into the personalities of some of the main actors in this drama, you may find this book a little too much of a character study, but I found it entirely enjoyable."

So he tends to add too much TV drama to the story in an attempt to make it more exciting.  The book ends up being rather boring as a result of this.  Math and graphs are necessary to make a story like this interesting.  And every profession has it's internal quarrels.  The reader can watch \"The Office\" for this sort of entertainment.
