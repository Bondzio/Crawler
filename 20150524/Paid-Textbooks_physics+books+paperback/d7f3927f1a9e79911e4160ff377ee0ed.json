                "Text": "Blatt and Weisskopf is a good, thick compendium of nuclear theory developed from a quantum mechanical point of view. It's become something of a classic it its time, and I think this is well deserved, since it is written with a good flow and clarity and also covers everything a nonspecialist in nuclear physics would ever need to know (and provides a good basis for those who are specialists). The Dover edition is nice and also inexpensive. I would highly recommend it as a reference for all physics and chemistry people."
