                "Text": "This book is very approachable, reasonably comprehensive, and connected to some of the most recent research topics.  Of the three books I have read on the subject of solar cells, this is my favorite.  The book contains discussions on solar cell behavior from a thermodynamic and electrical engineering perspective, which I liked.  I also found it to discuss the topic from a more fundamental perspective. Rather than just skim the surface of the major results of solar cell theory, it builds up the framework in an manner which is reasonably straightforward."

It was a great reference for teaching material and I referenced it in my PhD thesis.  I recommend this book in addition to Martin Green's Solar Cell book (standard undergrad solar cell reference book.)"

The treatment provides mathematical details at a level that will be accessible to science and engineering graduates and upper class undergraduates. Some derivations are not as well explained as others. However, the working relationships are worth knowing and can serve as a lead into other references. The book is well worth its relatively modest cost."

                "Text": "I am a newcomer to the field of photovoltaics and was looking for a book simple to understand but robust in content that would convey the fundamental concepts effectively. So far I am halfway through the book, reading during my coffee breaks and before bedtime and I am thoroughly enjoying it. I came to choose this book not by anyone's recommendation or referral but by the affordability and judging the table of content and few sample pages. Most of the other books in this area are so expensive, you have to sort of gamble a hefty amount of money to gain a very little perspective on the nature and scope of the field of photovoltaics. This book so far seems to be very good except there are some countable number of typos that sort of distract during the reading."
