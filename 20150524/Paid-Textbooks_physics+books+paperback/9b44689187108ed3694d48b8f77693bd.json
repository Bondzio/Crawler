The practice questions and passages were quite helpful and explanations of solutions were insightful and easy to understand.  I highly recommend this book for someone that needs a concise yet comprehensive refresher."

But for those who don't, like myself, Princeton is amazing. I got super frustrated at EK and TPR breaks it down much much better."

                "Text": "This book has some typos. Ex: p218 it says k0 = 9 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2: ^2. Ex2: p289 bottom of the page there is an incorrect explanation. If you solve the units properly, you should get (kg x m^2)/(C x s) is not equal to [s]. The book's solution incorrectly put (kg x m^2)/(C^2 x s) is not equal to [s]. I have not recorded every typo I have come across but TPR's Gchem book, hyperlearning science workbook, bio book, and physics books have some notable typos. Not sure about their ochem book or verbal reasoning book. Havent been able to find any in those yet. They are good study books. But these typos are frustrating to me. I wish there was a forum or something about TPR typos so I can find and correct them all."
