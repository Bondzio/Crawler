                "Text": "Usually, people who have studied extensively in a particular field can only communicate their knowledge in a manner which is incomprehensible to someone who has not.  Brian Greene has a writing style which does not patronise the reader or over-simplify the very complex subject-matter, but which does enable a curious lay person to get a grasp of it.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has heard about \"the big bang\", \"parallel universes\", \"black holes\" and \"string theory\" - perhaps through reading science fiction - and who would like to know what it's really all about."

                "Text": "In the opening pages of this sparkling gem of science writing, Greene emphasizes that he is not convinced that there are other universes and that the reader,even after completing the book, should not be convinced either. His point is that we can only have confidence in the reality of those things for which experiments and observations have provided conclusive evidence. Instead, Greene gives an impassioned argument that mathematics has time and again given us an early glimpse of things (like black holes, the expanding universe, radiation from the big bang, etc) that later observations confirmed. The Hidden Reality is about how various recent mathematical developments in physics are pointing toward the possibility that there are other universes. Greene guides the reader through these fully mathematical explorations without math but with his trademark crystal clarity. By tackling head on the important questions of how we might one day test these ideas--a theme the runs throughout the book but for which two chapters are specifically devoted--the book grounds the journey, and shows that his interest is in educating fully, not blinding with science-razzle-dazzle. And what a wonderful and remarkable journey it is."

Trying to wrap my mind around such theories is not often helped by articles and books on the subject, not that they are written poorly, but possibly the opposite, and my high school educated brain just isn't sophisticated enough to absorb them. But this book is different, and for that reason I am very grateful.  Mr. Greene writes for people like me, he uses words, images and examples that most anyone can understand, at least for the most part. He also suggests a few times that he is going to delve a bit more deeply into a subject and allow those who are less educated on the subject a \"pass\".  He does not insist his views are correct, but lays out all of the possibilities that he believes could exist.  This is great stuff, and I loved it."

                "Text": "What is real? This has been a question of mine for a long time. From a physics perspective Brian Greene explores the question in his new book The Hidden Reality, Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of Cosmos. While he's a physics professor at Colombia University, he writes in layman's language as far as such esoteric concepts can be expressed outside of mathematics. It took me two months to read the book \u2013 not a page turner but a thought provoker. I recommend reading the last chapter first to get an over view of the nine multi-verses Greene systematically explains in the book. Basically, the idea is that there is more than one universe, but there isn't agreement about how many and how they manifest. Of nine multi-verses that may be possible, the one that blew me away (well, all the theories blew me away) is the possibility our world could be someone else's computer simulation. Shades of the move The Matrix. In the beginning of the chapter on\u201d Black Holes and Holograms \u2013 The Holographic Multi-verse,\u201d Greene refers to Plato's allegory of the cave \u2013 that we are people chained facing the back wall of a cave watching shadows of the real world. That our perceptions are but a faint inkling of a far richer reality that flickers beyond reach. Greene has written two other excellent books \u2013 The Fabric of the Cosmos and The Elegant Universe (both PBS NOVA series as well). Take a stab at them."

I found this book, written by string theorist/physicist Brian Greene, to be an eye-opening account of the various (yes, there are SEVEN) multiverse theories.  Greene does a great job explaining these abstract speculations and the hard math that supports some of them very well. The various graphs & drawings help tremendously.  I am not at all a science-head (though I do program databases) but Greene's cogent explanations got me through some very heavy concepts, from the Quilted to the Bubble Universe; and from the cosmological constant to string theory.  I find myself exiting the book with so much more knowledge than when I began!  FYI, there is also an excellent YouTube documentary on the multiverse in which Greene himself stars & is able to illustrate his various examples.  All in all, a tour de force of information!"

Two stars not so much because it is a bad book per se, but more so because it champions the pathetic state the field of theoretical physics has fallen into. Instead of sheeding light on deep questions, the field has progressed to being no better than quack religion with mathematical justification. The real value of this book is that it exposes the rediculously speculative world of modern physics. The closest thing to a parallel universe is the way a blank canvas - perhaps with a random smear of paint on it -  is dubbed \"profound\" by the intellectualy void world of modern art. After reading this book I am convinced physics is at a dead end."

It did drag on a bit but overall I would definitely recommend this book to physics junkies like myself and those just curious on the latest curiosities to come out of theoretical physics."

                "Text": "The idea of parallel universes dates at least to Murray Leinster's famous short story, \"Sidewise in Time.\"  Long used as a device by science fiction writers, it has emerged in recent years as a serious idea in both philosophy and physics.  The late philosopher David Lewis, for example, argued that parallel universes were virtually a logical necessity.  Among physicists, particularly cosmologists, the existence of parallel universes has become a fixture of a wide variety of theories.  In this well written book, Brian Greene provides a tour of several versions of the idea of parallel universes.  These range from the consequence of conventional ideas of an infinite universe to extremely counterintutive ideas that we exist in a series of infinite computer simulations.  All of the parallel universe ideas presented by Greene have important features in common.  There is no direct evidence for any of them.  To varying extents, they are consequences of cosmological or other physical theories.  These theories enjoy varying degrees of support.  Some, like much of quantum theory, are very well supported by experiments.  Others, like the string theories used to reconcile general relativity and quantum theory, are without any real experimental support.  Inflationary cosmological theories occupy something of a middle ground with some empirical support.  Greene does not shy away from pointing out major gaps in knowledge and problems with theories.  In the course of discussing the different ideas of parallel universes, Greene discusses a good deal of modern physics and cosmology.  He is a fine writer and his expositions are good to excellent.  This book leaves the impression that some kind of multiple-parallel universe is a basic feature of reality though which version and whether there will ever be empirical support for their existence is unknownable at this time."

                "Text": "What if the universe as we know it were only one of possibly many? That is the fundamental question behind this latest book by physicist Brian Greene. Greene takes a very simplistic approach to things as he explains how scientists believe that our universe is not alone on its own & also describes the theories behind possible alternate universes & what they might look like. In each subsequent chapter we go further & further in depth into the concepts behind each of these possible variations in the multiverse & experience numbers on both sides of an extraordinary scale. It helps that while you don't have to have a complete understanding of current studies in the world of astronomy, physics or cosmology to make this book make sense. No matter what the thought that there could be other versions of us out there somewhere is still fascinating & proving this will be even more fun. Definitely a read for any of us who've wondered if parallel realities exist."

In this book he explores the ideas behind the main theories of possible parallel universes. Many reviewers have covered the main comments which I would have reviewed so I will not repeat them. In contrast to other reviewers I would like to offer one caveat; bear in mind that many of these ideas, while fascinating, are currently unproven. Therefore, while this is a great book always bear in mind that physics must demand that ideas are subject to experimental verification. Enjoy this book and its exploration of the forefront of modern cosmological ideas but never forget that mathematics, no matter how elegant, are not a proof of reality"

For the most part, Greene shows an adept command of the content, and remains both scientifically and philosophically objective; furthermore, Greene plays devil's advocate when necessary -- even to the point of making the reader wonder whether he should chalk whole thing up to G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem, as in the final chapter on mathematical reality. Having said that, the density of several ideas (e.g. Higgs fields and potential energy curves, the string landscape, probability waves) in relation to parallel universes escapes even Greene's conciseness, and the most tantalizing ideas (i.e. black holes and the holographic universe) are given decidedly less attention. Nonetheless, the book is a profound read for those with an inquisitive nature and a background understanding of string theory and quantum mechanics."

                "Text": "Thought provoking and sometimes downright jaw dropping. Greene presents a case for why modern developments in physics may imply the existence of various different kinds of multiverses. His scientific explanations were difficult, but in my opinion, easier than Stephen Hawkings'. He has a great gift for using familiar analogies to explain concepts impossible to visualize, such as the 9 spatial dimensions of string theory, or quantum tunneling events. It turns out certain conceptions of a multiverse are a natural progression of some well established scientific theories such as quantum mechanics. Even more surprising is that nearly all of Greene's multiverses may someday be supported or contradicted by experimental evidence. Only one proposed multiverse he discusses is forever removed from any potential observation by principle. Before reading this book I had always thought of a multiverse as an obscure and unnecessary concept evoked arbitrarily by scientists for philosophical reasons. Greene managed to really shake my views by explaining that actual scientific principles give rise to various views of a multiverse. Our world is truly an amazing place that seems to become larger and more astounding with every generation of scientific advances."

                "Text": "I enjoyed this much more than the last Brian Greene book I read (The Elegant Universe). I would recommend reading through all of the footnotes as you go. Greene readily admits that much of this is speculative, but that's part of what science is - building and speculating on what we already have, looking for deeper knowledge and explanations, following where the math points to. He presents the different multiverse scenarios in approximate order of plausibility, starting with if our universe is truly infinite then there must be copies of us out there based solely on the possible combinations of particles, and ending with the thought that all mathematical possibilities are manifest. In response to those who would say that scientists, or books like this at least, are going out of their way to look for an atheist explanation of the cosmos, some may be but in general I don't think so. I think the \"I don't know\" point just keeps getting pushed back further."

The Standard Model of the universe has a dozen or so constants of nature that form the \"input\" into the model. There are no succesful explanations of why the constants have their observed values and if one varies these constants even a little bit then the universe would not be compatible with the things that make human life possible (e.g. stars might not form.) This is the little anthropic principle - that the universe is the way it is because otherwise we would not be here to see it. The large anthropic principle is the thought that the universe need not have turned out the way it did, implying an experiment that recurs. This is the jumping off point for the discussion of the hypothetical but well-reasoned thinking by scientists on the possibilities for other universes."

If you like his previous works, you'll probably like this one as well. My only recommendation is to skip Chapter 10, Matrix redux, it is a waste of ink and paper and puts a horrific stain on the rest of an otherwise well written book.  Factually there is nothing wrong with Chapter 10, I pondered all these issues when I was between 10 and 12 years old, but I discovered girls at 13, grew up and put this nonsense back on the sci-fi shelf.  To have Dr. Greene actually give this stuff print space in one of his books is sad and pandering to the conspiracy theory types in our society.  Definitely buy it, read it, enjoy it, just skip Chapter 10."

Don't expect Mr. Greene to write a prescription for serenity or even a hint as to the meaning of reality, for he asks the reader to share the quest for understanding reality through, quite frankly, as yet untestable hypotheses.

The author has an amazing ability to break down very complex concepts in a way that makes them understandable. This book might change your perspective on the universe and your daily interactions with it, however I found I frequently had to go back and re-read certain parts to get a good grasp on the concepts so I could move on to the next chapter. I hope Brian Greene continues to publish books like these, in many ways I see similarities here between the author and Carl Sagan."

Overall it is a fascinating book, as long as one is aware that most (if not all) of these parallel universes are basically theoretical in nature. As expected in a book by Greene, a significant proportion of it is devoted to expounding the soundness of string theory. Good light reading."

I am sure this book will be well accepted by those in their first year at MIT, et al., whose base mathematical education far surpasses mine. At age 82 and far, far beyond formal education years, I still find many works covering quantum physics fascinating. Greene writes very well. I think I can fairly say I understood about 70% of what I read. But that other 30% is a real problem for me."

This book covers tremendously complex theories and their development and supposition by new theories.  It does this in three ways, maybe four.  It uses a lot of analogies that make complex ideas easier to understand, goes into more depth once the concepts are understood and can branch off into higher complexity which I as a non-science guy can get but perhaps not fully understand - but get enough to move on to the next discussion.  At the same time it offers more detailed and informed discussion for the more advanced.  This is very well written by someone who I think sees his personal mission is to  bring science to the masses.  Highly recommend to anyone and especially to the young who might express some interest.  A read like this could forge our next great scientists."

In his book \u201cThe Hidden Reality\" Brian outlines several theoretical models purposing the existence of a vast plurality of universes of which ours is only one. Brian discusses how the science of contemporary theoretical physics arrived at these ideas and details each of the concepts in a way that we can understand. He then offers ideas as to how the science may push forward, in investigating which of these ideas may be most realistic, using experimentation, observation and theoretical work. Brian\u2019s communication skills are amazing in that he is able to describe some very far out ideas using down to earth and easy to understand language. This is a must read for anybody interested in learning where the frontiers of cosmology are in this present age."

They are trying to discover the origins of the universe using mathematics (since experimenting on the origin is a few billion years too late!).

One of the things which constantly bothers me about books like this is that scientists use all these terms that are not themselves understood. There are 11 dimensions. (Fine. What IS a dimension?) Time slows down at high speed and in intense gravitational fields . (Great! What IS time? What is a particle? (A string, maybe?  Ok. What IS a string?) What is a field? (A disturbance in space? Ok.

                "Text": "I found this very hard going and it took me a while to try to understand the concepts even to the extent I am capable. But Professor Greene makes understanding this complex subject as easy as possible through metaphors and well thought out consistent explanations that avoid jargon and that do not require mathematical training. This book opened my mind to concepts and ideas that I had never thought about before. If you want light reading, skip it. But if you want a scholarly explanation of Quantum theory and the multiverse, I have never seen a better explanation. I bought  copies for three of my closest friends so we could have discussions and expand our understanding. All of them have also found the book deep and enlightening and we have had several in depth discussions about these concepts as we all work thru these new ideas. I recommend it very highly if you are ready to do the work."

I was just curious.  I've always wondered what was 'out there'.  About a year ago I watched The Elegant Universe on PBS.  That was my introduction to Brian Greene.  I liked how he explained the universe and string theory.  By that time, also, I was hooked on Fringe, a science-fiction show on Fox, whose plot involved parallel worlds.  Then this book was offered by Amazon Vine and I ordered it.  That's the evolution of how I came to read this book.  However, did I understand it?  Absolutely not!  I didn't expect to.  I did read every word of it though.  It'll probably take me a lifetime to understand half of it, but like I said: I read it for the possibilities.  Now, back to writing my romance novels.  Those, I understand.  :o)"

                "Text": "Brian Greene's latest book on the mysteries of modern physics looks at several models that hypothesize the existence of parallel realities or \"multiverses\" as the author refers to them as.  The book is written in a manner that seeks to present these ideas to readers who may not be versed in math and physics, so many analogies, graphs, and diagrams are used to illustrate what is being presented. Greene acknowledges the limitations of science and the reality that our understanding is always evolving.  The book is well organized and it clearly explains at the outset the author's approach to presenting this subject.  Nine different models of parallel universe cosmologies are described and Greene examines how we might or might not be able to test these theories. This book shares pieces of the history of theoretical physics along the way, weaving tales of persons such as Bohr, Einstein, Schrodinger, & Heisinger into the discussion of what has led up to the theories outlined in this book.  I found this material to be understandable and Greene's approach to be pretty balanced and sensible.  This book is thought-provoking as it invites us to consider the philosophical implications of what physicists are uncovering about the nature of reality. Greene is adept at explaining these subjects in a way that the general public can follow along, so for those interested in these subjects this book would be a good overview."

                "Text": "This is not an easy book to read, even for readers of books in this genre. And the reason is likely that it is filled with so much airy speculation that it's hard to get a grasp of anything substantive. The positive part of the book is that Brian Greene devotes substantial effort to explaining the extremely abtuse and befuddling theories that some people believe suggest our universe is just one of a countless number of other ones. Why the recent attention on the multiverse? Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in The Grand Design are honest about the present dilemma in scientific theory: Natural laws, the constants of natures, the geometry of the universe, and other cosmological factors seem nicely tuned to allow humans to exist.  But this fact suggests a designer, which cannot be tolerated in our current scientific worldview. Thus, in place of a designer (or at least a need to explain the apparent design other than by luck), a growing number of scientists are now joining the multiverse bandwagon: with an infinity of other universes it's easy to explain this one; ours just so happened to have the right configuration of particles and forces to allow life to exist.  But is this an explanation or a cop-out? As Paul J. Steinhardt, one of the leading contributers to the inflationary big bang, recently wrote in Scientific American, \"a theory that predicts everything predicts nothing.\" The unavoidable hole in The Hidden Reality is that Greene never puts science's quest for the multiverse concept in perspective and leads the reader to think that science is merrily on its way to discovering a host of unknown worlds; all it needs is larger particle accelerators, quantum computers and more time. But science does not need the multiverse; what it needs is another approach to explaining the one real world we know about."

Reading this book will not let you understand string theory, branes, multiverses, etc. on a deep level, but you will end up with a very good understanding of what all the effort is about. The book goes to great length to explain that the picture generated by string and M-theory may not be the road to reality, but it does give a feeling for the strangeness of our universe and some of the underlying features that must be present in any final theory. It will only be as some experimental results become available that science will be able to distinguish between some of the many flavors of string theory and hidden reality that appear to underly our simple 3-D appearing universe. I would recommend reading the first half of Greene's \"Elegant Un,iverse\" before tackling this book if you have any previous training in quantum mechanics and relativity. Greene gives an excellent review of these subjects in a way that makes you wish he had taught you the subjects in the first place. More than once, I thought, \"Oh, that's what this was about\". If the current ideas about the underlying mathematics of the universe prove to be wrong or incomplete, then you will still have a good introduction to the road leading the \"theory of everything\"."

And it avoids the \"gee-whiz\", \"isn't this cool?\" approach of many pop-science books. In fact, calling this pop-science is  misleading. This book takes the reader through the myriad steps that explain WHY scientists are considering the possibility that there might be other universes. Which means the reader has to do some brain stretches to grasp how physics got from the old days of Newton to the new vision. The work pays off in spades. Without an equation in sight (well, some are in the endnotes), you climb the mountain of physics and take in a grand vista. Even if physics isn't your thing, you will find yourself swept by Greene's narrative."

Only string theorists *need* recurring to the idea of a landscape of many different universes. But string theorists should better apply the Copernican principle to themselves, too: they should accept that, in physics, we live in a multitheory environment, in which string theory cannot play a uniquely central role any longer."
