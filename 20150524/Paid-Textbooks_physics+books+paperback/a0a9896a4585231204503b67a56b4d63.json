                "Text": "This book not only brings the little-known and amazing discoveries and inventions of T. Henry Moray to the reader's attention, but introduces New Energy developments up to the present day.  Dr. King also shows how the technologies behind  Moray's inventions are resurfacing in the hands of contemporary scientists and validating Moray's findings.  Dr. King also keeps our interest up by exploring the science behind the inventions, weaving the strands into a plausable theory of how all this untapped, \"sea of energy\" can be accessed for an almost cost and pollution free source of electricity and power so badly needed by the world.  My only disappointment was that the book wasn't at least three times the length as there is so much of interest to anyone with a desire to know from where our future supply of energy and possibly the salvation of our planet may appear!"

                "Text": "I have never seen anything like this before.  A slide presentation (with minimal notes) is all this is, folks. Very disappointing.  I wouldn't have minded if there had been some useful information, but I imagine that King supplies the \"missing meat\" when he gives his slide presentation.  As it stands, this book leaves me as in the dark as I began.  I was hoping for some illumination (puns intended) on the workings of the energy machine.  Perhaps the sparse notes included here are sufficient to an electrical engineer.  To a mere lay person, the book is opaque.  Too bad!  I hate to write a negative review like this, since I really do support the man's work and this type of research.  It's just unfortunate that this book does little to advance the cause of free energy research, in my opinion.  I'm returning it."
