                "Text": "One of the best introductions to physics ever written.  Conscise and plain even for the most novice science reader.  Before the \"for Dummies\" series there was the \"Asimov on\" series and this was the best of that series.  Higly recommended especially for the young person who enjoys science but also good for developing a love for physics in the first place."

I have taught High School Physics for 25 years.  I learned from this book what is just skimmed over in physics textbooks.  An enjoyable read, chapter by chapter!!!!!"

This book, though long out of print, is still a great introduction into the type of physics we encountered in our daily lives.  Pulleys, fulcrums, acceleration, mass, energy.  All the stuff of daily life for the past dozen millennia now made more understandable thanks to Asimov."
