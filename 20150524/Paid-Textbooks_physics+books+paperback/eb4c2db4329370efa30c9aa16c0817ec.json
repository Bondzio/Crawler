Some of the questions in each chapter start to diverge from the book some requiring either to look up values online or to have prior knowledge to something relating to this subject that even a major like myself lacked."

One downfall to the text is that some of the analogies chosen to simplify concepts are not very helpful.  Also, I don't believe answer keys are given to the chapter problems.  Overall, however, a good read."

And for those that have to use the book and have no choice because its the class textbook, dont even bother to look for the solutions to the exercises. The book does not come with any solution what so ever to any problem in the book.  And dont try to look for it online beacause its RESTRICTED to professors only!!!!  There is no help from Cambridge in this matter.  They have no sense of helping students achieve better grades or to overcome this difficult course. If you dont have to buy it, DONT, it will not help anyway!!!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!"
