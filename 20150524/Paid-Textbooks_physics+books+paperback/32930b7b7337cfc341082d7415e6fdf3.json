                "Text": "When people think of physics, they often think with horror about its more abstract sub-disciplines such as quantum mechanics, relativity, elementary particles, cosmology, etc. As a result, many people shy away from this most basic of sciences. But one thing that this book makes perfectly clear is that much of what we see in everyday life is easily explainable (or analyzable) using the elementary physics that one learns in late high school and perhaps early university courses. Using this most basic physics, the author has done an absolutely superb job of dissecting the scientific credibility of modern movies using the scalpel of Newtonian physics and the laws of thermodynamics. The movies discussed are action/adventure/science fiction/fantasy-type movies, i.e., movies that are more prone to stretching and outright breaking the basic laws of physics for the benefit of added spectacular effects. Equations are included throughout but in special boxes for those who are more technically inclined. The writing style is very clear, most engaging and very tongue-in-cheek (even hilarious) when discussing matters related to the scientific literacy of Hollywood movie makers. This book can be enjoyed by everyone; however, it will likely be most enjoyed by science buffs and movie aficionados alike. It could also be used as an exciting complement to any basic physics courses."

                "Text": "This book examines many things that happen in movies.  So, you see a guy with an automatic weapon firing for 20 seconds straight.  This book lets you know the firing rate, and capacity so that it would be empty in 1.5 seconds.  Also, the weight of bullets, e.g. Matrix Revolutions, at that firing rate, wheelbarrels of bullets won't do it, you need truckfulls.  Besides the physics - how fast an explosion goes, versus gravity pulling our hero down to water (they always jump away from an explosion), would give him 17 inches down toward water - oops, fried.  Beside the fun physics, what I remember from high school and freshman college physics is in seperate boxes (e.g. Force = Mass x Acceleration) used to give details.  You can skip these if they are too dry for you - but I love the backup info.  What is great about this book is that the author does not just dismiss stuff - e.g. let's say Superman can fly (given), but if he swooped in to save Lois, coming to an immediate stop, all his kinetic energy would be converted to heat - about 6000 degrees.  Or Spiderman, to zip around would need about 1/3 of his body weight to be web creating fluid.  Lots of great stuff covered, Star Trek inertial dampers (without they'd be pancake crew), shields in all space movies, Matrix Revolution firing, bullets knocking someone off his feet (e.g. Lethal Weapon), how much explosive to blast the asteroid in Armageddon (oh, about 1000 of the largest nuclear bombs Russia ever built), the bus jump in Speed (how it could actually happen, versus how they filmed it), etc.  Lots of great movies covered, without ruining them.  Clearly this author loves movies as much as I do, and yet wants to educate readers on physics so you don't try to start a gasoline puddle fire with a cigarette (highly unlikely to work - read the book and see why!).  The end of each chapter has a short list of PLUS and MINUS for movies in the category - e.g. [-][-] planets that explode in a few seconds, [0] terrestrial fireballs traveling great distances at hypersonic speeds (incorrect but forgivable), [+][+] fragmentation grenades detonating without large fireballs.  So each of these plus and minus relate to movies in the prior chapter, and notice the author often 'forgives' some physics because it is good for the movie/story."

I wasn't crazy about the method of presentation, however, and would have preferred a different structure.  He inserts little summaries that are of no interest and don't really contribute to the book.  Perhaps they're meant to be cute.  I was also a bit surprised that he did not have a chapter or section dedicated to miscellaneous misconceptions about various technologies.  (My #1 peeve here is when someone sets off a single fire sprinkler head and water comes out of every other head simultaneously.) Granted, these issues aren't strictly physics, but there are reasons that systems and devices work the way they do and those ARE based in physics."

It makes for much less work on their part if they don't have to research things like the second law of thermodynamics, or even whether a cigarette can really light gasoline (hint: it can't). This book is written for both, the common man who is curious about how things work, and the physics enthusiast. It smashes giant gaping holes through Hollywood's poorly researched attacks on the laws of physics and shows in detail the facts to back up their claims. This is a definate blow against those who thumb their noses saying \"it's just a movie\" as they contribute to the dumbing-down of audiences everywhere. Most importantly, you can impress your friends and family with your newfound wisdom (while hopefully not ruining their favorite movie!)."

Science fiction movies in general are inaccurate when it comes to science. Most people know this, but they just don't care. Movies are all about suspending disbelief. This books seems to prove that people who study physics have no imagination.
