                "Text": "I am a big fan on Lee Smolin. He\u2019s a courageous theoretical physicist who is not afraid to be a pioneer of new ideas and new approaches to physics. I have enjoyed all his books with my favorite being his first \u201cLife of the Cosmos\u201d. In this book, Dr. Smolin argues that time is real and not an illusion as some believe the case may be due to relativity. One of Dr. Smolin\u2019s strongest arguments for the reality of time is that the universe and the world clearly show evidence that evolution has taken place which can only occur if time is real. He believes the universe shows signs of evolution and that black holes are ultimately the seeds to new universes and universes have evolved, through cosmic natural selection, to produce many black holes. He makes some profound statements: \u201cThere are aspects of the real universe that will never be representable in mathematics\u2026 One of them is that in the real world it is always some particular moment\u201d. He makes some statements that seem to go beyond what we can really be sure about: \u201cThe universe has no relation to anything outside it\u201d. Overall, I think this book is a worthwhile read. The only problem I had was that some of the discussions were difficult to tie into the main topic. Keep an open mind when reading this. You will learn a lot about the history of the concept of time from the point of view of theoretical physics."

                "Text": "Dr. Smolin lays out a fascinating case for what he labels \"temporal naturalism,\" a fundamental philosophy that appears to be at odds with what most students are taught as a basic tenet of special relativity: the relativity of sumultaneity, which underpins the concept of spacetime and leads to a no-present \"block universe\" view. The author does a masterful job of presenting complex theoretical arguments in simple, clear terms that make for a highly readable and instructive journey through the mysteries and controversies of contemporary physics. His long personal quest to make sense of apparently paradoxical concepts comes through in the writing, which veers between scientific skepticism and assertions that at times seem passionately strident. As a layperson, I often experienced frustration with arguments that seemed to conflate our intuitive sense of the passage of time with objective universal theoretical constructs, especially in discussions of local versus global phenomena, which often seemed to beg more questions than they resolved. He saves some crucial issues of subjectivity and qualia for the epilogue, and I was left questioning whether the blank-and-white question of time as presented was truly fundamental or tangled in semantic ambiguities and questions beyond the current reach of empirical science. Yet, I would call this a must-read for anyone interested in the philosophy of science and I have tremendous admiration for the brilliance of its author, and appreciation for his devotion to interpreting theoretical physics for an audience of inquisitive amateur philosophers like me."

To most of us may seem obvious that time is real, but actually, according to the current physics viewpoint and Dr. Smolin explanation, time doesn't exist. Today mainstream physicists believe we live in a Universe completely defined in a four dimensional block that goes from Big Bang to the end of time, which in fact, makes time an illusion, as well as many other things, such as free will and choice. Time Reborn argues that time is absolutely real and proposes some theories or ideas as to how handle this in physics. Time is real, but space is not. This is hard to digest and I do hope some other even better theory can explain our reality, which everyday seems to get more and more complex and surreal. We really need now another Einstein!"

Of course, multidimensionality is difficult, but I am reminded of Feynman's line that if you can't explain it, you probably don't know it."

I particularly liked the way he correlated controlled experiments and closed systems, that is the way that hypotheses become theories and then laws. Later in the book, he launches into theories relating to the whole universe even the multiverse. At this stage he prefers Leibniz sufficient reason over the idea that every theory in physics should be testable. Rather obviously theories about the whole universe, let alone the multiverse, derived by an observer from a small planet in a small galaxy are hardly testable. He then concludes that time is real, there is an arrow of time, there is cause and effect but not before Smolin appears to launch into 21st century scholasticism. By the end of the book, I felt that the last few chapters were written with his tongue in his cheek. It is an entertaining read although I would prefer a book that discusses in lay terms the contradictions in modern physics."

There is a high corespondence in his understanding of time and that of process philosophers (Whitehead in particular).  I am surprised he has not explored this connection, or if he has why there is no discussion.  While valuing Leibnitz, most process philosophers have moved to a more nuanced understanding of time while still building on its significance.  Having said that there is still much in this book and I highly recommend it to all those interested in process thought."

I mean, it would probably help if I understood physics better, but that's precisely what I'm saying: it's been easier for me to at least feel like I am understanding what authors like Brian Greene and Michio Kaku are saying when they discuss their ideas about physics than it was for me to understand Lee Smolin.

I think Time Reborn is well worth reading but I got less out of it than the other book he wrote that I mentioned previously. I did however, find some of this book quite fascinating. The author attempts to insert time into physics while at the same time acknowledging that mathematical equations are essentially timeless, and that to place time into physics would be problematic because of this. The author spends a lot of time going over issues such as this; issues that straddle both science and philosophy. He covers aspects of the work of the mathematician/philosopher Leibniz, for example, a part of the book I found quite fascinating. I have no idea whether he is on to something with this book, I don't have the expertise to know. However, if you have already read \"The Trouble with Physics\" or you are in the mood for some a philosophical/scientific/mathematical discussion of a potential solution to the problems in physics that exist today, I recommend reading this book."

I am not a theoretical physicist so I can't really judge the validity of his approach, but unlike some other recent popular books on physics this book left me a little nonplussed. It's still quite good for a historical overview though. Also recommended is Sean Carroll's book, also about time but easier to understand."

Dr. Smolin does a very good job of explaining the present crisis in physics, the increasing disconnect between researchers being trained today and why there needs to be a new paradigm that will include time in the equations.  Some researchers seek Natures\u2018 truths, others seek to find more devices, tools and toys for humanity.  There will be room for both but the first is science the second, technology. The cart should remain behind the horse and in this case, give the horse some more leeway, let\u2018s be curious once again, let\u2018s try something new, it is high time."

This was written by a man who has a personal agenda against certain current popular theories in physics and a chip on his shoulder when it comes to mathematics.  He describes mathematicians and physicists of certain sensibilities to be \"searching for the eternal\" when this idea quite flies in the face of everything which science and mathematics stand for.  He still never described Time to my satisfaction or really explained how it existed at the start of history, and uses a lot of vague terms such as the fact that the internet has essentially given us an extra \"spatial\" dimension or that \"internet-like\" space sprung out of Time.  Pass this one over."

But rather than work within the paradigm of relativity that means time is not real but instead a matter of interpretation and systems used to measure it, there must instead be a new paradigm that respects time as real as well. The arguments are clear and the explanations beautiful (though the diagrams look deliberately homemade and make you feel like you are in class with Lee while he draws on the board). This is an excellent book and should be the next major introduction to time that people read."

And this, so shortly after his last excellent critique of today's physics. He falls prey to what he was denouncing then, dragging the reader in a meander of  fuzzy thoughts about time that really don't connect to the practical and the sensible in us. His intellectual cul-de-sac made a lot of reader including myself drop out of this depressing little trip that really tells nothing of interest. He probably needed the money to send his child to college and I forgive him. But his book will not have the impact on the science of physics comparable to an asteroid hitting the earth. In my humble opinion, it is more like a micro-meteorite impacting  a high-floating cloud when no one is looking."

The content is a mixture of material which is quite easy to understand (and most of which I already knew), interspersed with very high-powered discussions which seemed to require a profound prior knowledge of cosmological theory to understand. Part of the problem may be the absence of equations (it doesn't even include E=mc^2): there are many places where a lot of verbiage can be replaced and often made clearer by an equation or two. Somehow the author seemed to feel that readers would be put off by equations but not put off by sentences like \"These include the approaches called causal set theory, matrix models of string theory, and dynamical triangulations.\" Whew! In fairness, the author does suggest that the reader simply skip things he doesn't understand, and I did find my bearing a few pages later, but the problem I had with the book was that I already knew the things that I could understand, and I was utterly baffled by the rest of it."

He may have valid physical intuition that leads him to think of time as fundamental. But in this book, his arguments come off as naive appeals to the subjective phenomena of the passage of time, which is divorced from scientific models. I guess that's sort of his point, but he hasn't offered any new way to do science. He's just complained that science can't account for his subjective view of time. He seems to have gotten roped up by qualia and other such mystical nonsense. Its sad."
