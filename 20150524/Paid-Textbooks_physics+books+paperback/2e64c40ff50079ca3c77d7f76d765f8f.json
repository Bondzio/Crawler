                "Text": "Essentially what you're going to get from the University Physics Study Guide is roughly 2-3 conceptually worked out problems, about 5 fully worked problems, and then finally a few try it yourself problems per chapter. Also to be noted, each section has a brief summary of concepts and equations for each chapter of the book. Overall, I found the study guide to be extremely helpful, with really no notable errors. If I was short on time before a quiz or test, I just read the study guide, and it really did help. This specific book covers chapters 1-20."

                "Text": "I found this study guide in my library when I was reviewing for the GRE Physics subject test.  It's really good at getting you to understand the conceptual, problem-solving skills that are absolutely essential to any physics problem.  If you're using the associated textbook, and you have fears about understanding such a challenging subject, absolutely get the study guide--and use it!  You're enlightened with every section, and if you work the problems independently after you follow along, you're basically guaranteed an A."
