                "Text": "I have been teaching college physics as my second career for more than a dozen years, and was sorry to see Gerry Wilson's excellent textbook becoming more and more anemic with each edition and new co-authors. In the earlier versions, Gerry conveyed excitement and curiosity in each chapter. It is this aspect that I find so refreshing in Lou's book - his use of \"real world\" examples to introduce topics that can be tried by the reader if they are unfamiliar to them, and his gentle introduction to the subject. His ability to lead the reader deeper and deeper into the physics concepts as the chapter progresses is done masterfully. I had the pleasure of meeting Lou a few years ago when he gave a local seminar, and he was as bright, interesting and gracious as he appears to be in the textbook. Bravo!"

                "Text": "This is the second physics text I have owned and I do not care for it as much as the first. It explains the material with a number of stories, historical references, etc. to aid in retaining the information, but the practice questions are a bit confusing. Also, there is little emphasis on equations and calculations which are a huge component to physics. It would not be my first choice, but it is an okay one."
