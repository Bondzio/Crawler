                "Text": "I found this book extremely well written and an excellent introduction to the physics of wave propogation. In my own work I am concerned with the way a light wave propogates through the optics of a telescope. I read the 1967  edition of this book and was pleasantly surprised by Towne's comprehensive  and well explained coverage of this subject. This book would make an  excellent undergraduate upper level course."
