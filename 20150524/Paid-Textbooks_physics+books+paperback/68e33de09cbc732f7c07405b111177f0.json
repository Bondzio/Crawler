I learned more from this book than from my Solid State class. They also mention practical things that are actually done in industry, which is cool."

Davies only assumes about an undergraduate familiarity with the subject, making the text a great \"bridge\" from core textbooks to research papers. There have been many occasions when, upon not understanding a paper, reading a section in this book made everything clear."
