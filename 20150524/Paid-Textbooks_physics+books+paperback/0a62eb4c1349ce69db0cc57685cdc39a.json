                "Text": "This book has been used by several universities and adopted as the course text for several years by the US Naval Academy. It is written to strengthen student's background in applied math, and has many clever example problems. The degree of difficulty is slightly greater than most other texts on the subject but it is justified in that the aim is to improve student's math prowess."

It organizes well Navier Stokes to other equations such as  Euler's and Bernoulli's. A useful text for undergraduate engineering  students."
