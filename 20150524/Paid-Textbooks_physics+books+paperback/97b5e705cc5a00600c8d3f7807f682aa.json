                "Text": "An earlier edition was my textbook in a community college class named after the book.  A remarkable assembly of basic concepts in physics, unencumbered by endless calculations, but soundly and thoughtfully presented in concepts with supporting equations applied.  There is a reason this book is in at least its 12 edition.  In addition, the book is printed in over 20 languages around the world.  Any student fortunate enough to have a course built around Mr. Hewitt's genius for clarity will come away with a better understanding of how the world works.  His love for the discipline shines through with humor, illustrations and equations which inspire students around the globe.  If you love physics, Conceptual Physics needs to be on your Must Read list."

Excellent. If required for you, compare and save here too plus get it quickly like we did!"
