                "Text": "This book addresses a great many of the problems that one encounters day to day in a beer quality laboratory. The writing is in a style that is easy to understand and I thought that the best part was that the book was written with a great sense of humour. I never thought that I would enjoy reading a chapter on  \"statistics and process control\" and yet the author guides you through it in such a way that he leaves you with a clear understanding of the concepts and you enjoy the journey. The author appears to be  superbly qualified to write the book from his experiences in the brewing industry."

It gives a good introduction into the various tests that can be performed on raw materials, wort, and finished product.  Recommended for brewers."

                "Text": "For beginners only! The content is written for someone who doesn't have any background with quality control in an industrial setting.  Basically one course in statistics and food chemistry will greatly exceed the knowledge presented in this book.  The information that is presented is clear and well written, but lacking in depth or actual applicability.  I was disappointed in the amount of applicable equations, tables and data, especially based on the title of the book and the academic background/experience of the author.  The 200 pages are a result of a very small book size. This book wasn't worth the price."
