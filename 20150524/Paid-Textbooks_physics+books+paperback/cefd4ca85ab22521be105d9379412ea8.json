                "Text": "I think this book is very useful as a practical guide for people involved in experimental studies of thing film optical properties. It provides a lot of general considerations and methods for optical constant measurements and  derivations of basic formulas for the most important  thin-film-on-the-substrate configurations. I defenetely recommend this book  to everyone in thing-film field."
