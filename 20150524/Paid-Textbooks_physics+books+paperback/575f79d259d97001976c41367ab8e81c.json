                "Text": "Of all NASA Mission Reports; the one on APOLLO 11 is the best and most exciting! I'm sure you can figure out why!  Next to the book: FIRST ON THE MOON; I'm using APOLLO 11'S ist volume and volume 2(nasa mission  reports) to represent all the other mission reports! You cannot; for the  money; find more information and hundreds of beautiful; priceless photos  of each mission; each mission report is priceless in itsself!  Robert  Godwin and NASA has really done a tremendous job on these reports; and  thank goodness they have finally came out! To me, a big APOLLO fan, this is  the next best thing , than having each book filled with real Moon rocks,  and the men who went there! P.S.: And the CD that comes with each book on  each mission has hundreds of photos; both in black and white; on lunar  surface, and in Lem as well, including orbiting the Moon, and showing  beautiful pictures of Earth! I simply do not know how you; Mr. Godwin and  NASA did it; but thanks so much for these mission reports!  They are  truly worth the money! Areal bargain for  sure!  I loved the Apollo 11 volumes 1 and  2 so much; that I purchased 4 copies of each; to put back for my son and  relatives, to always remember 1st lunar landing by!  I'm so looking to the future Apollo missions to come; and especially the  x-15 mission reports as well this Fall! They just cant come fast enough:  they're great! Thanks Mr. Godwin and NASA! many thanks indeed!"

                "Text": "Anyone who has an interest in the history of Apollo will want this book.  The QTVR of the landing site on the CD-ROM is absolutely killer.  The QT movies on the CD-ROM remind me of something you'd see in a high-school  science class (all you need is the sound of the projector), but they were  still entertaining."

                "Text": "This is the first of 3 Mission Report volumes for Apollo 11 from Apogee Books.  It is a priceless collection of mission reports, press kits and interviews from both before and after the historic flight.  It also includes a CD ROM.  All reports are reproduced with great care and give the reader an impression of what it must have been like to receive these items when they were first released by NASA in 1969 (although some were declassified a few years later). Apogee Books should be applauded for their efforts to preserve these great documents for present and future generations."

But the CD Rom is a masterpiece of modern technology's ability to show what it was really like at Tranquility  Base. The Quick Time videos of the landing site makes one feel like being  in a movie. Outstanding!!"
