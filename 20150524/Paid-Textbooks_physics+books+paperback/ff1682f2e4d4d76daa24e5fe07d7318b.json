Anyone who wishes to move forward into quantum field theory would be well-advised to master all of these problems before proceeding.  Also, check out Galitskiy Jr.'s course on quantum physics available through [...]!  It's a great introduction to the techniques required in this volume, and oming from one of the author's sons, puts additional authenticity into the learning process!"
