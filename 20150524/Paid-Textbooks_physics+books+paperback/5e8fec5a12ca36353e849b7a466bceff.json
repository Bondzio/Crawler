                "Text": "This is the Volume 7 of the famous Course of Theoretical Physics by L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz. All serious students of theoretical physics must possess the ten volumes of this excellent Course, which cover in detail and rigour practically all the branches of theoretical physics. The Volume 7 treats the subject of the mechanics of deformable bodies. Unlike the major part of other similar books, the Volume 7 is concise and very elegant, and is at the same time detailed in the exposition of the basic elasticity theory. Moreover, it contains certain topics not usually found in other similar books, such as the theory of thermal conduction and viscosity of solids, and a detailed exposition of the fundamentals of the mechanics of liquid crystals. A highly recommended book!"

Dans ce qui \u00e9tait l'union sovi\u00e9tique, cette entreprise a conduit \u00e0 mettre dans les mains de nombreux \u00e9tudiants dont j'\u00e9tais, des livres sur des sujets vari\u00e9s sans comparaison avec la litt\u00e9rature scientifique ni anglosaxonne ni fran\u00e7aise. Bien s\u00fbr il y avait dans la collection MIR quelques insuffisances mais beaucoup de ces livres alliaient l'orignalit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9marche avec la pertinence des propos. Il a parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 reproch\u00e9 l'abondance des math\u00e9matiques mais c'est en cela m\u00eame que ces livres sont pr\u00e9cieux. En effet il faut quelques efforts pour comprendre. L'elasticit\u00e9 est un petit bijou qui malheureusement avait disparu , on ne peut qu'encourager les \u00e9diteurs \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9diter toute la collection."

Timoshenko writes for engineers while Landau writes for theoretical physicists so either one of them sucks from the other's perspective. That being said I recomend this book for anyone interested in the subject because it is always enlightening to see Landau's insight"

Landau is a great physics educator in general but not an expert of elasticity.  If you compare any  elasticity book with Timoshenko's you will sure be very disappointed.  Anyway I think this book is still fairly well written."
