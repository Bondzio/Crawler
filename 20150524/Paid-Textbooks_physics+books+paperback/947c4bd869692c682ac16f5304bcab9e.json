                "Text": "Too bad this is out of print - it is perhaps the most readable introduction there is to fluid mechanics (& its limitations).Starting from the simplest cases & from the physical descriptions, Shinbrot  derives the mathematical models & describes what is known (or was known  20 years ago) about solving these models.After exhausting the classical  approach, he gives a pellucid description of the modern function theoretic  approach to solving PDEs. Along with anything by Alexander Chorin, this  book is highly recommended as a first step to learning fluid mechanics  & as a guide to the frontiers of the field."
