Then he discusses each of the world's major (and minor) religions and how they would react if (and when) extraterrestrials arrive on Earth.  It is a fascinating discussion and well worth reading!"

                "Text": "This spring, 2015, Dr Weintraub taught a course at Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Vanderbilt with this book at its center. He is as witty as he is thought-provoking on the subject. I had long believed, based just on the astronomical numbers, that there likely is life elsewhere in the universe. Dr Weintraub not only encouraged that belief but revealed the science behind how we are today confirming the belief and how the various religions of the world will deal with it when it is confirmed. I highly recommend the book."

A little too scholarly to be an enjoyable read but it documented the facts quite well."
