But when I registered on the website the access code that came with the book was for the wrong book. So not only did I waste money on a book I could've bought used but now I also need to buy a new access code because while I ordered a physics book the access code that came with it was for human biology. waste of money!!"

As a non-mathematician nor physicist, I have found that the ideas were presented in a language that is easy to understand. The explanations were supported by diagrams and photos to reinforce the core ideas. This great book is worth the price."
