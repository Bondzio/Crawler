                "Text": "Although this book contains many topics that are not discussed as extensively elsewhere, the previous reviews of the book have made me very apprehensive about trusting anything I read it in. I too have found errors and consequently only use the book as a supplemental source. As soon I find I don't understand something in this book, I stop reading assuming it's because the text has errors and typos.  Frankly, having no trust in the book makes it almost worthless. So why did I buy it?  Simply, it was so inexpensive, less than $10 including shipping, that even if I get only one or two ideas out of it, I would still feel it was worth the cost. Nevertheless, I make sure not to invest much time in figuring out anything in this book that is not obvious. By the way, the author's affiliations are only given in very vague terms which further increases my mistrust of the content."

                "Text": "This book is even better than I expected in terms of content.  Yes, there may be typos here and there but for a person seeking out a simplified presentation of QM ideas and the math, the book is very clear and useful, loaded with problems AND solutions.  The copy I received was near-new, perfectly clear of any markings and in every respect a bargain. It also was very well wrapped and thus in that respect too the seller deserves this kudos from the buyer."
