                "Text": "This is a review of the pearson physics lab mastering. I hate it. some of the questions that are asked for your homework have the wrong answer. So if you really care about your grade, and the computer says you have the wrong answer you spend hours trying to figure out why your correct answer is correct. I've used pearson for other math related courses and the same problems keep coming up. It wastes my time and infuriates me and because of pearsons mess ups it affects my homework grade. pearson mathlab is the devil... that is all."
