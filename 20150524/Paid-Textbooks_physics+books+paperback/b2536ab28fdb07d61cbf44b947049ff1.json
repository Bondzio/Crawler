Good derivations of equations of motion and their assumptions. This book is a  masterwork and an  awesome referencebook for everything that has to do with  waves!"

Each grad student in my research group learns the fundamentals of elastic wave propagation from this text, and often gets a free copy from me - as my copy is completely worn out of years of usage. I picked up this book for its consistent notation and strong coverage many many years ago when I was a grad student, and  I am still using it regularly."
