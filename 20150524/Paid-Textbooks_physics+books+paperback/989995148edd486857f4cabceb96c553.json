                "Text": "I majored in humanities but I'm interested in math and science, and I find this book both challenging and rewarding. But as I worked through it I found a number of things that looked wrong. Eventually I Googled the book's web site and found an Errata file that I downloaded. It identified 58 errors, most of them in equations and many of them significant enough to thoroughly befuddle a careful reader who trusted the book as written. That's an appalling number of errors. Somebody at Basic Books ought to be looking for a new job. I recommend the book if you are interested and willing to read carefully, but if you can't wait for a second, corrected printing be sure to download the Errata before you dig in!"

And it's a real shame, too, because the content seems quite well put together; unfortunately the issue is so damaging to readability that I had to return the book, despite the fact that I really enjoyed the first few sections I read -- imagine my frustration. I tried to read it on a Samsung Galaxy S3, which I successfully used to read several other books, including books about physics, statistics and maths in general."

Lots of differential, partial differential, and integral calculus, Poisson brackets, as well as vectors/linear algebra. The 'good news' is that readers will receive more than the minimum necessary to understand basic classical physics and the material covers Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetic fields, and basic thermodynamics. The book summarizes a course taught by Susskind to residents living near Stanford - I suspect his attendees are mostly graduate-level engineers."

I really like the mano-e-mano format. Its not daunting and you get the feeling a friend is hand holding you all the way through. Now I hope there will be some follow up maths books to the Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity and Statistical Mechanics online courses as well. It'll then truly become the 21st century equivalent of the Feynman Lectures books of the 20th century. Great job you guys. I am happy to be owning and thank you so very much to put a smile on my wallet as well. Its the cost of two Sandwiches in Manhattan and a bag of chips only this stays fresh and lasts longer. Should we start calling it the little white book you can tuck in your bag with your iPad. I love it. Modern Physics and its mathematical accouterments have truly arrived to the common man through the vision of two men. I think this is re-birth of the cool!"

To think what I behind.  To think that I helped my physics and chemistry major friends with introductory group theory when they had all this fun stuff about how the world works running around in their brains.

The ultimate insight the book tries to tell the reader and prove is: \"The laws of physics involve gauge fields, but objective phenomena are gauge invariant.\" I have always wanted to know what gauge invariance actually means, so this book to me is rewarding. As expected, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations are introduced and explained. With these, the nature of Noether's theorem and ultimately gauge, among other things, are described. There are quite a lot of aha moments. Not necessarily easy to follow fully but unfortunately a must-read if one wants to understand quantum mechanics, which will be dealt with in the next installment."

It claims to introduce the necessary material of a first course in physics, including the relevant mathematics, but it instead seems to cram two years of math into ~200 pages and then go straight to advanced mechanics. While it's supposedly appropriate for a dedicated lay reader, how anyone who doesn't already have a STEM background is expected to make sense of this book is a mystery--I have taken calculus, diff eq, analysis, etc. and I was completely lost after 80 pages or so. Newton's Laws of Gravitation get a passing mention in the appendix. If this is a \"first course,\" I suppose there must be some zeroth course lurking about that they expect you to take first. Either that, or the book is really meant as a textbook to go with the online lectures from which it was originally derived."

On the negative side there is an extensive errata list and I wish there were more problems solved in the text. Difficult problem solutions, which should have been illustrated in the text, are left for the reader to work out. Even highly skilled Physics' majors would have difficulty solving some of the problems, although the book was written for the intelligent layman who just wants a better understanding of difficult concepts in Physics and is not a Physics' major at a top-tier school such as Stanford, where the book was written."

That is, physics is as much (or more) mathematics as it is finding out what angle to shoot a cannon ball at in order to hit a target. This book makes it clear that you must know how to take the partial derivative of a function and at least have a fair understanding of integration. Insofar as the book's title is concerned, it is correct. This is certainly the minimum you must know to start doing physics. The key word here is start, because these concepts must be developed and applied even further in understanding quantum mechanics, and QM is something every physicist must know to get even an undergraduate degree."

It explains many approaches that your typical University Physics textbook leaves out, including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics, Symmetry, and Poisson Brackets. It also reviews the math necessary to carry out the physics problems."

You won't simply \"read\" this book; you'll need to \"work\" your way through it with notes and working on the problems it poses. Hopefully the result will be an expanded understanding of modern physics. I'll update my review when I finish the book."
