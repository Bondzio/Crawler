                "Text": "This book is probably the best resources you can get for IB physics.  It is tailored to the IB syllabus and contains nothing more than what you need for the exam.  This book is especially useful if your teacher does not teach, or somehow decides not to teach according to the syllabus. Also, it is a must for people who want to do well but are not willing to read through 500 pages of their textbook before the exam.  For me, it certainly contributed to my 7 in physics HL, and I know it is probably go to do the same for you."

                "Text": "I liked it because instead of several paragraphs of essay style writing contained in a regular textbook, this book gives a more concise visual approach and uses many diagrams and boxes with text inside to explain concepts. If you are SL or HL Physics, I strongly recomend this book."

                "Text": "This book is the best thing you could buy for the IB Physics test.  It has all the information you need for every single topic.  And it goes in order.  Nothing is left out.  The text looks intimidating at first, but once you start reading and highlighting, it becomes so easy.  I used this book to study for my IB physics SL test, and I got a 7.  Oh yeah, and for one of my options, I studied a topic my teacher never taught in class.  I learned it all myself from the book.  So that just goes to show how good it is.  I higly recommend this book to anyone that wants to score high on this test.  I also bought the IB Biology book, and so far it's helping me a great deal just for tests and quizzes."

                "Text": "This book has basically everything that will appear on the physics papers, either standard or higher level. Study it alongst with your textbook(s), solve plenty of physics problems and you will get at least a four over seven. Of course, if you are willing to work harder, I recommend that you get some more A-level physics books, and with those on your bookshelves you will most likely score a seven."

                "Text": "Ok...let me put this straight...this book is concise...it may not contain everything you learnt...but it does a good job in reviewing the materials for the diploma. It is a good resource if you know the stuff and is just looking for a book to help you revise. I finished my diploma, and got descent good grades by this book, it is concise, and that is what I like...instead of those wordy physics books that can teach you something in less than 1 page...but drags on to 3 with damned terrible confusing english. This is a good book. Buy it. You may even need it if you are studying a course in physics in university."

This book is very well organized and it tells you what you need to know and what you dont need to know. Not only that but it simplifies the topics so you are able to understand them. This book is the only reason why I passed the Physics Exam."

                "Text": "This book was really worth it, especially for those pesky multiple choice exams. I took Physics HL, and this allowed me to get good grades. Before I got this book, I was really struggling with the concepts and I was spending so much time trying to understand them. Once I got this, it made it a lot easier, and saved me a whole lot of time. Only down side is that it needs a little bit more detail for the options. The exercise questions in this aren't the best for practicing, especially compared to the IB question bank. For those reasons I give it a 4/5."
