                "Text": "Lanczos' book is a compelling analysis of the principles of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. It reminds me a bit of Feyman's Lectures on Physics because it focuses on the motivating principles behind advanced mechanics. In an elegant and flowing style, Lanczos guides the reader through a walking tour of the principles of mechanics, peppered with historical footnotes. If you understand how to use mechanics, but want to understand how the underlying principles are developed, this is an excellent choice."

                "Text": "Lanczos makes mechanics feels like art in this superb work. Analytical Mechanics is the foundation of physics and Lanczos has complete command of the theme. The purpose of this book is to make one understand mechanics \"from inside\" and not to stress methods of problem solving. Lanczos says that very clearly in the preface. The beauty of the book is that it's not in the same category as Goldstein, instead feelink more likely to Landau, so the bad criticism of the 2-star guy comes from someone that missed this."

Also, the proof of the Euler Lagrange equation was unique, as I have always seen it proven differently that the way it was done in this book."
