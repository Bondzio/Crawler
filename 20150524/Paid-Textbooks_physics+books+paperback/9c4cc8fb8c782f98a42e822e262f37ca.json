As a book for refreshing, it did a decent job, but I wish it had been calculus based instead of algebra based. Otherwise this is a very useful book, and I'll be using it instead as a reference when I tutor my high school physics student. Fairly thorough, and it did teach me a thing or two I didn't know."
