From a historical and internal perspective, Heisenberg speaks directly to the the reader without the intellectual ego that often accompanies a man of his renowned stature."

But, for someone who has done a great deal of reading on the topic and possesses an advanced degree in a relatively unrelated field (clinical psychology), this is a very readable book on Heisenberg's thinking related to quantum physics.  For those who know anything about quantum physics, however, it cannot be overemphasized that this is, in fact, only one perspective on quantum physics (though, probably, the most accepted).  Heisenberg was one of the originators (along with Wolfgang Pauli and, particulary, Niels Bohr) of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics.  For anyone interested in a more deep analysis of the thought that went along with the development of this incredibly groundbreaking thoery, I recommend this book highly!"

                "Text": "The world paradigm described by physics seemed to have changed with discoveries in the early 20th century, and yet due to the complexity of the science involved society has not been able to fully accompany that change. With that in mind, it's perhaps unfortunate that this book has not been given more prominent publicity since it was first published in 1958. In the book, Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders of quantum theory, gives a broad and insightful overview of relevant discoveries in physics in the first half of the 20th century and discusses their implications for science, philosophy, and everyday life. He relates important discoveries in physics to the history of philosophical and scientific ideas since ancient Greece, Descartes, Kant and Newton. With special insight based on his personal relationship with many great scientists of the last century, including Einstein and Bohr, he introduces the meaning of ideas such as the Theory of Relativity and his own Uncertainty Principle relating to the physical laws governing the behavior of subatomic particles. Despite dealing with complex subjects, he does a great job, in most cases, in translating concepts for the lay reader. Among many subjects, here are some things that he talks about: how \"matter\" is fundamentally composed of energy, how the search for a basic fundamental particle, or building block, of all other materials is influenced by our interference during the process of searching, how common notions about the nature of space and time disseminated among the general public since Newton need additional qualification, how the geometry of the universe, understood since the time of the Greeks may be understood differently in light of recent discoveries in physics. If you are looking for an explanation of 20th century physics in plain language by a top expert in the field, this is it, or probably as close as you will get. I would recommend this book for anyone in the general public who is interested in obtaining a basic understanding of the topics under examination in modern physics, and perhaps also for aspiring scientists who want to gain an understanding of the history of ideas that has led to current research. A great read."

                "Text": "This is an excellent work due in large part to Heisenberg's acumen both as a physicist and a philosopher.  Unfortunately,  even some of the great physicists have been somewhat shallow philosophers.  For whatever reason(probably the fact that his father was a professor of classical studies),  Heisenberg had a very good grasp of many philosophical viewpoints.  He was able to mostly avoid the cartesian bifurcation that traps most physicists even to this day.  He understood that much of the \"trouble\" with Quantum Mechanics was caused by our unwillingness to let go of the bad metaphysical assumptions that became implicit in classical physics.  Overall, this is an excellent book for anyone who wants to understand the beauty of Quantum Mechanics with eyes wide open."

Should be required reading for every student entering grad school in physics, but also suitable for many of us who are curious about the underpinnings of modern science.  No equations, no diagrams, but every concept is laid out so clearly that none are needed.  Writing in the middle '50s, Heisenberg set forth the four great conceptual systems of modern physics (Newtonian mechanics, the theory of heat, electromagnetism and quantum mechanics) and pointed the way to a still-gestating fifth system that would include all of them.  Unfortunately, he left us in 1976, just as physicists were beginning to see the interrelationship between entropy, information theory and the rest of the field.  Who knows how much further along we'd be had we had the help of Heisenberg's genius and continued contributions in this area."
