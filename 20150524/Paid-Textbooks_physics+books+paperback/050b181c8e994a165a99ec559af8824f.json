                "Text": "The books by Slater (one of the great professors at MIT) are known by the low sophistication of formalism combined with a deep physical insight, apparent in the way problems are solved, using analogies, clever simplifications, numerical estimates, etc. It's physics, Fermi style. Though the theory is very sound, it is in the problems that the book excells. If you work through them, you're done with electromagnetism, and you'll love it forever."

                "Text": "This book is worth buying for two good reasons 1) its an excellent treatment of extremely important concepts of electricity, magnetism and interaction of light with matter and 2) because its very affordable and very readable. Its good read for physicists, and its more than useful for material and / or polymer scientists, who use light as a tool to investigate properties of matter. Basic concepts are explained quite well here, and like many other Dover texts, it is terse, cheap and yet masterful."

                "Text": "This is a very good book to follow the study of, say, Haliday. Slater was, in writing it, worried about teaching methods of theoretical physics, as well as of electromagnetism. The text is brief and to the point, with the  elegance typical of the master Slater was. Maybe the strongest point,  however, are the exercises. These are the best you will find in any book on  EM."
