My primary notion is to convince the students that an understanding of the basic ideas of physics will enable you to comprehend more complex principals.  To accomplish this, I am always searching for real life examples which demonstrate physics ideas.  \"The Flying Circus of Physics\" provides a rich mix of these examples that makes the student see physics as part of their day-to-day life and not an abstraction."

                "Text": "This is my favorite book. This is a fantastic collection of hundreds of physics puzzlers, many taken from everyday life. It is full of thought-provoking questions about: superballs, silly putty, tops, and yo-yos; boiling water, dripping faucets, and blowing bubbles; rain, rainbows, snow, lightning, and tornados; bicycles, cars, boats, airplanes, and spaceships; magnets, electricity, radio, and television. It has answers in the back, but it is more fun if you try to figure it out for yourself, and resist looking up the answer. Some of these simple questions are so deep that scientists don't know the answers yet. Literally wonder-full."

This will cultivate your capacity for using physical modeling ideas you are learning from class to think about real world phenomena.  That is, it breeds the kind of concrete, practical thinking which people like Richard Feynman mastered to superlative effect.  Keep some problems in mind to think about it idle moments."

It was recommended to me by a qualified PhD for him. I did spot check a few pages where I felt qualified, and was favorably impressed with Walker's approach. I suppose it is directed at a science-motivated high school student. As I recall, he first selects a narrow topic and then explains it in some detail without trying to snow anyone. Given some free time to study it thoroughly, I would certainly buy a copy for myself to learn about related fields of science, and to update my own specialty field. If there is to be any downside, this light-hearted title is a bit of a misnomer and may put some people off.  My apology to the author."
