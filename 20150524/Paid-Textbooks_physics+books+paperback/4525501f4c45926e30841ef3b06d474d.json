                "Text": "This is a very cool exploration of the world of experimental physicists. Wide and far, high and low. It's a novel way to examine modern physics, linked not by history or theory but by the extreme places where the experiments are being run. It's very readable, as you'd expect from an editor for New Scientist and National Geographic News, and for the same reasons it is a balanced review of current physics theory including dark matter, string theory, quantum gravity, and cosmology. It's a fun romp like a Nova special, but with the added depth and insight was get from a good read. A few more pictures would be good, but otherwise this book meets and exceeds its mission."

The author is astounding in his ability to make the current cutting edge physics projects come to life, and even his historical comments are fascinating to read. This is a book about a subject or subjects that normally might be rather boring, but this is NOT a boring book, and in fact it is remarkably quite the opposite. Wow!"

                "Text": "It's truly rare to find a book that satisfies the reader's intellectual curiosity as well as sense of adventure, and this book does just that.  Fabiola Gianotti, an Italian physicist and spokesperson for ATLAS, a particle physics experiment at the European \"Large Hardon Collider\" prefers physics to philosophy because \"experimental physics is based on facts\", and less about contemplating inventive ideas.  Mr. Ananthaswamy touches on the latest astrophysics theories and fascinating experiment results in the harshest conditions from all corners of the world that explore the origins of the universe, the shape of it, along with its past, present and future states, and then some.  There's something for everyone in this book, including those who are knowledgeable about the subject matter.  For as much as physicists do not yet understand the makeup of our universe (\"nearly 90% of the mass of galaxies seems to be made of matter that is unknown and unseen\"), multiple enthralling experiments with revelations are in the making, and Mr. Ananthaswamy does a magnificent job of explaining it all.  It's been a while since I've come across an intriguing piece of work such as this."

I have a degree in physics (and advanced degrees in math and engineering) yet I found this book to be both challenging and fascinating. It literally kept me up until midnight, I couldn't put it down. The mixture of cutting edge physics and descriptions of experimental locations around the globe is well balanced and, unlike many other popular physics books, genuinely interesting and a pleasure to read. It was a privilege (and also a bit of an adventure!) to share the author's journey. If you're interested in understanding cool stuff like quantum gravity, not the math but rather the significance, this is a highly recommended book."

                "Text": "In this book, Anil Ananthaswamy takes trips to a few select places where physics experiments are ongoing. Along the way he details the history of each place, a history of the science that has led to the current experiments, and he tries to explain what the experiments are trying to reveal. He also does talk a lot about the non-science aspects of each place, going into the details of his trip (which, when you're visiting places like the south pole is not so trivial). As a fan of history and science I enjoyed the book, and consider it to be very similar to books like \"the red limit\", just updated by 20 years. The book also has an accompanying website (you can find it with google), which includes lots of photos, videos, and other information from the author. (Unlike most book websites it's actualyl good and has fun information)."

If you are looking to catch up with what is going on in physics today this is a good book with a simple presentation suitable for high school and beyond.  The author is a science writer, not a scientist, and the book reads very much like a series of articles from most science magazines.  The book jumps around constantly, with a discussion from the 1930's, then something from the 1990's, then back to the 1960's etc and from one unrelated topic to another.  However, his writing is usually entertaining and a worthwhile read.  This review was done from a copy of the book in my local library."

This book contains just enough science to establish a baseline understanding and just enough travelogue to be entertaining.  The author traveled to some of the most inhospitable places on the planet to get first-hand reports on the status of our search for the answers to questions on dark matter, dark energy, and other questions of physics which will help us understand our universe.  I was surprised in some cases at how far (literally) scientists and researchers will go to set up the conditions which allow them to collect the data necessary to move the marker forward.  I expect the author has notes enough to turn this non-fiction book into an excellent novel.  The trials and triumphs of men trapped on a frozen ice lake in Siberia or in deathly frigid Antarctica unravelling the secrets of the universe would make a great action adventure survival story.  At any rate, I'd recommend this book to anyone at all interested digging a little deeper into all the stuff they keep plastering across the Science and Discovery Channels about the search for dark matter and dark energy."

                "Text": "I expected a book on physics that would provide some interesting insights into the latest developments of physics, and while there was some focus on that, the author's whininess tended to take center stage the majority of the time. While some insight into what he was thinking was okay, the result was a pop science book that mostly focused on the complaints the narrator had about the different climates he was in, and his fear of possible death in those climates. Certainly he took some risks, but I would've enjoyed a book that focused less on melodrama and more on science."
