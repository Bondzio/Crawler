                "Text": "This book was extremely well written and covered not only supernova and GRB's but all areas of theoretical astrophysics. It gave a concise coverage for each chapter. It didn't rely on mathematics or equations which makes it good for readers who aren't scientists. The only downside is there are a few unusual words due to the book's translation from French, but this can easily be solved by looking up the words in a dictionary. I would recommend this book to all readers interested in astrophysics and cosmology, only a basic background knowledge is required."
