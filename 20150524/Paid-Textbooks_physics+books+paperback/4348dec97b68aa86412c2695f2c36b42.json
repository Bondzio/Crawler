                "Text": "The manga guide to... series is a great one so far. These books are a great way to get to learn such hard coledge level courses in a fast, easy, and fun way thanks to some cool manga and a professor from japan. Overall the book was very easy to follow and even at times very funny and made the process of learning more fun and enjoyable. I like to think of the fact that as a kid we were taught like this, so why can't those old ways work with such topics as physics? This isn't some sort of little kid comic the jokes and manga itself are for teens and up, and is meant to help out high schoolers or even college students. I really liked this book, and I am even going to try out some of the others, and would highly recommend any of these books to someone who wants to or needs to learn one of the topics of these books."

                "Text": "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand the basics of physics. Not when you can read \"The Manga Guide To Physics\" by Hideo Nitta (Professor of Physics, Tokyo Gakugei University) who takes the novel approach of utilizing the Japanese animation image (called manga) to explaining the concepts that comprise the science of physics including momentum and impulse, the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, Newton's three laws of motion, the movement of objects after collision, vector diagrams, kinetic energy calculations, and more! The readers are educated in the 'real world' applications of physics by Megumi, an all-star athlete who is failing in her physics class. She is distracted in her tennis matches as she worries about the questions she's missed on her physics test. That's when her friend Ryota teaches her about physics using everyday objects ranging from roller skates and slingshots, to braking cars and tennis balls. As entertaining as it is informative, \"The Manga Guide To Physics\" enables ordinary readers to readily grasp the basics of physics and would make an ideal curriculum supplement for a school physics class, and is ideal for anyone seeking to inform themselves about how physics works and is applied to understanding the world in which they live."

                "Text": "The Magna Guide To Physics uses the same format of comics and paragraphs but this time we are reading about Megumi, an all-star athlete that needs a little help with her Physics. The Law of action and reaction, force and motion, momentum, and energy is covered but through story. There are even lab exercises in the book for the reader to put what they are learning into action. This seems like a great book for those students taking physics right now as well as those that just want a refresher course on the basics. Having not taken Physics myself it was kid of fun to dig into the subject right along with Megumi. I don't know that I am a big Magna fan and I think that you should be to fully appreciate these books. While the subject matter is great I think that a familiarity with the comic style would help. If you like Magna already or know someone that does then these are the books for them. They deal with complex subjects in a fun narrative way."

Even some of the stranger ideas are cleverly reiterated through the protagonist's \"everyman\" reasoning. At the end of each section, there is a review of the concepts, but the explanations are pretty in depth! I was able to understand more in those little back pages than whole chapters of my textbook. I highly recommend this book for new physics students."
