                "Text": "As a Feynman fan and layperson with a reasonable understanding of his work I found this book lost me before I was halfway into the first chapter. It looks good coursework material and from what I can tell is packed with  amazing amounts of information. But without a strong fundamental grounding  in basic physics this book will remain on your bookshelf."
