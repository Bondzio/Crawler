                "Text": "Beginning with the \"How To Use This Book\" and \"How To Excel in Your Physics Course\", (especially the latter) and throughout its pages, this is, without a doubt in this readers opinion, the very best book  on the subject I have found to date (And I have many). It puts you through  the paces. If you want to know this subject and excel in it, these authors  have placed before you the practice you will need. I recommend this book  highly for your first experiences in this subject. Starting with the  mathematical background required; then on to Classical through Special  Relativity. It covers each and every topic, in a clear, concise method that  enhances learning and improves retention greatly in each and every area.  It's a great reference to have on the shelf. EXCELLENT! My thanks to the  authors. Your book has helped me much more than I ever expected."

This book gives you how to attack problems in a very organized manner even though the problems are not  so difficult.  I came to be able to solve more challenging problems in a  different book after solving the easy but organized ones in this book. I  recommend this book!"
