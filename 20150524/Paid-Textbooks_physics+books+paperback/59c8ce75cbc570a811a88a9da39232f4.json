                "Text": "Robert H. March is a Proffessor of Physics at the University of Wisconsin.  The text developed out of the course of the same name.  There is not alot  of poetry going on here.  He aims to make the principles of physics as  understandable to a comoner like my self, not initiated into the high  scientific mysteries, understandable.  There are formulas here, but some  things can't be undertood without them.  You don't need much more then a  grasp of highschool algebra to follow along.  Presumably even a poet has  had this.  It is a chronological review of Physics from its inception by  the greeks to the curent edge of partical physics.  Or at least what we can  at least hope to understand.  Clearly writen, and a supurb attempt to  render this very difficult material understandable.  It will take some  effort on the reader's part to understand, but it is well worth doing so.  He really can't make it any simpler without becoming inaccurate."

This book, Physics for Poets by Robert March, is an interesting and well-written survey of physics for the non-specialist.
