                "Text": "Readers should be cautious about buying this misleadingly titled book. I have two reservations. The first is that there are not many \"dummies\" out there who would be comfortable with the heavy amount of abstract algebra and trigonometry thrown at them at the very start of the book (Chapter Two). He expects you to simply have faith that it is somehow relevant to the subject matter to follow. Why not start out with some basic simple facts about lenses and introduce the math and explain it only when it becomes necessary? But then the author even comes up with what appears to be questionable basic science. Example: in Chapter One  the author announces that \"In optics, only the electric field matters in almost all interactions with matter, because the electric field can do work on charged particles and the magnetic field can't.\"  Really? Then how do electromagnetic generators work? And what about electron microscopes? For the real dummies like me, I suggest you consider a book like Chris Ferrie's \"Optical Physics for Babies.\" The optics there is considerably easier and more intuitive to grasp."

                "Text": "I would have given this book five stars for introducing concepts to me with their historical naming scheme and useful mathematic equations, but it's missing some of the equations needed for my project of building my interferometer. It includes Thomas Young double slit experiment, but it is missing equations to determine where basic logic circuits would appear during 'wavefront, light on light interference', . It introduces things like telescopes, prescription glasses , lcds, projectors, diffraction, refraction, reflection, fresnel and fraunhoffer. But is still an excellent source for a beginner in Optics. I could do better while I am in a productive dream state, but this is a great book for beginner's. And I Love It. It's a great introduction and a scientific tease. Basically what I was looking for in a book today."
