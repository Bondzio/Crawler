                "Text": "The companion study guide to University Physics is so concise, so boiled-down simple that it can act as a replacement to the textbook in courses with a good professor who delivers detailed lectures and to students who take solid notes in those courses. There aren't any tedious derivations here (the derivations are easy enough to find online if you need them), just a list of key concepts and formulae followed by sample problems. A crucial homework companion, a more crucial test prep companion. It's helped me organize my understanding of each chapter and allows me to \"preview\" upcoming lectures."
