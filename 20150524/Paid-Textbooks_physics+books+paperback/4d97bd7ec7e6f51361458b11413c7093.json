What a wonderful book, not only for the groundbreaking idea he posits but also for his beautiful prose style of writing.  How refreshing it is to encounter a scientist unafraid to challenge our perceptions and go against the tide bringing us a fresh perspective on old puzzles.  Indeed it answers many conundrums that Physicists have traditionally ignored.  Why indeed are the laws of nature balanced so precisely to afford our existence?  Is biocentrism the answer that has been tugging at the edges of our understanding for so long?  Who can deny that Dr. Lanza may be on to something here?"

                "Text": "I'm a little surprised to see such a variance in ratings for this, but I suspect it may be more from people resisting some of the ideas instead of simply enjoying the discussion. Robert Lanza is obviously very talented and smart, and he is a great person to learn more about - so take the time to expose yourself to all of the work he has published, including other books/articles and his website/twitter feed. I enjoyed this book mainly because it was a great way to open my mind to alternative thoughts and theories about reality and our experience of life. I never approach material like this with any preconceived notions - I just love to see what great thinkers have to say and I try to stay open-minded about things that may seem \"out there\" to others. He mixes science with some personal stories as he explains his theories, and you can tell he relishes his role of challenging the establishment (mainly the physics community as a whole) while he does this. I enjoyed every page and I look forward to keeping up with the future works from a true maverick of thought like Dr. Lanza."

But at least the book, Biocentrism, has put even my limited intellect right smack in the middle of everything.  Why, heck, I might even be integral to the Grand Unified Theory of the Universe.  If I don't look out at the cosmos, it isn't there!  Don't worry; I'll be sure to glance upward every night just so the stars don't blink out. Biocentrism, as expected, provides almost no answers, but the new questions it asks are . . . fascinating."

Quantum Physics is a hobby of mine and I have read several books (as well as taking college courses) on the subject. Much of the theory and experiments described were quite familiar to me but the authors give some a new slant. I found the book mostly to offer a most hopeful explanation of the mysteries of this life that we all find ourselves so involved in. I LOVED this book."

                "Text": "Author Robert Lanza MD has, since childhood, sought out and been mentored by Nobel Laureates and it shows.  His radical presentation of the last 50-70 years of quantum physics research and the significance of that research takes us beyond where The Tao of Physics and others started.  His clear readable text (combined with some amazing personal stories of his colorful and dysfunctional upbringing) brings us face to face with the fact that science, like conventional religion, has an \"edge\" beyond which nothing is understood - like \"why are we here?\" or \"what happened before the Big Bang?\"  A beautiful, hopeful, and brilliant case for consciousness underlying all of Creation, told from the scientific point of view.  Great read!"

                "Text": "This is one of the most important books written in a good long while. For over 100 years quantum physics has sat balanced and unresolved, ready to fall on the side of classical physics and materialism, or to finally embrace to resolve the quantum enigma that life presented. The classical school anachronists, despite unparalleled advances in all other scientific fields, haven\u2019t had the wherewithal \u2013 primarily scientific courage \u2013 to confront the challenge of moving this field forward. Well, Robert Lanza has brilliantly confronted this, to make probably the most significant advance in the last forty years. It would naturally take someone who possesses both scientific acumen and spiritual acuity to pull this off. In retrospect it is clear that the answer couldn\u2019t come from hard science alone, but would require a tremendously high polymath mind to blend in the necessary component of spiritual philosophy - after all, it was the life ingredient they couldn't think with. A scientific centrism bereft of the bio, not only makes us a cosmic joke and a relatively impossible dice throw, but is also pointless. And he presents this tectonic shift of thought with an astonishing form of academic grace. If Einstein had been born again in this new age where such ideas are (barely) acceptable, and written his theorems in a new type of scientific poetry to incorporate life, it would have to be similar to Biocentrism. (Makes you wonder about reincarnation.)"

Some of the ideas in it are very well presented, and some not so well, and yes, it is soft on the science.  I can't fault it for that, however.  There's a lot going on here, and it's up to the reader to follow up on the pieces that catch his/her fancy.  The point of the book, I think, is to get the reader thinking in a new direction.  I, for one, don't have a solid background in hard science, although I am the sort that picks up and reads pretty much anything so I do have a broad background.  Delving too deeply into the science would have made the book unreadable except to those with the right sort of education -- I don't think that is the only intended audience.  I also found the mini-autobiography that is woven into the text interesting.  I kept waiting for it to tie a bit more securely into the theoretical portion of the text, but that never really happened.  It did break up the mind-bending theorizing, humanize the authors, and perhaps make the book more readable, but it also padded the content to make it look more substantial. It's the sort of book I want to give to my friends just so we can discuss it."

And even more, something we can not avoid. He offers a perspective very different from what we've all been taught and challenges us to step outside of the box and dismiss conventional wisdom in order to fully comprehend his central thesis.. That life creates the universe, not the other way around. He insists that Physics will keep falling flat on its head when searching for a unifying theory unless they incorporate consciousness into the equation. Sound far fetched?? Not when he brakes down the basics of his theory with a style and flare that I wish my High School science teacher had. He never fails to be informative while entertaining all at once. Sure to be regarded as a classic, and even more impressive that for once we get an honest explaination of the universe and our role in it.. From the mind of a Biologist, not a Physicist!!"

With brilliant anecdotes, illustrations, and wonderful personal stories, Robert Lanza presents his case beautifully that creation exists because we are here to observe it. Confusing? At the subatomic level particles only exist as potential energy unless being observed. He had me thinking that my refrigerator does not exist if I am upstairs sleeping and not observing it. This theory is given credence by some seemingly convincing scientific experiments. I gave it 4 stars because Lanza promises in the beginning of the book not to intermingle God in his theory and then proceeds to give some explanations on how a star was observed over a certain baby in a manger. Otherwise it is a fascinating read and was certainly written for the layperson."

This is not a new idea and there is absolutely nothing new in this book. Lanza draws on two main sources to back up this idea. The first is that consciousness appears to cause the wave function to collapse in the famous double slit experiment. The second concerns the anthropic principle and how it seems that universe is uncannily just right for life. Both of these 'proofs' are open to various interpretations including the possibility that consciousness does indeed lie at the center of creation. However, that is only one possible conclusion that can be drawn and Lanza adds absolutely zero to the debate. He uses his book to lambaste physics and physicists for such like as not being able to tell us what came before the big bang, whilst at the same time declaring consciousness to be the be all and end all of everything without actually defining what consciousness is or offering any sort of explanation of how it came into existence or how it creates the physical universe. On top of that much of the book contains sections that have absolutely nothing to do with the subject matter and concern nothing more than Lanza's own life experiences. He uses these chapters to butter his own biscuit, blast his own trumpet and bang his own drum interspersed with a bit of name dropping. The worst book I've read all year!"

While I strongly agree with the premise, I don't see how the conclusion follows.  If a tree falls in the woods, just because we aren't around to translate the changes in air pressure into sound doesn't mean that the tree didn't create these changes in air pressure, and it definitely doesn't mean that the tree doesn't exist.  I enjoyed learning about the author's life, but I don't enjoy that he apparently ignored bodies of research from both perception and consciousness studies.  He answers \"consciousness\" without going in to what that might be.  Anyhow, kudos for challenging classical physics with quantum mechanics, but that new age boat left many years ago, making this book nothing new."

I would strongly urge you to first read the book Quantum Enigma by the physicists, Bruce Rosenblum Phd and Fred Kuttner Phd, PRIOR to reading Biocentrism, as it will give you a grounded NO-nonsense description of the \"quantum strangeness\" in physics that Dr. Lanza and Dr. Berman are discribing in their book. I especially want to complement Dr. Lanza for his courage in sharing the \"emotionally difficult\" stories from his personal life. Both Dr. Lanza and Dr. Berman are highly respected scientists which lends great credabilty to their theories expounded in Biocentrism"

                "Text": "Robert Lanza's expert review of the central role of consciousness in shaping not only our understanding of the universe but actually in creating the universe, by making links between the implications of quantum mechanics and biology, returns life and spirit to the centrepoint of our understanding and at the secret heart of the universe.  The implications of this book - that consciousness along with matter is fundamental to properti, ies of the universe, that consciousness is not a mere byproduct or epiphenomenon, is staggering in its implications.  Nevertheless, this view is not quirky but based on a solid foundation of science and has been implied ever since newtonian mechanics began to become rapidly qualified by quantum mechanics in the 20th Century.  Most scientists have been reluctant to face the philosophical implications of their own fundamental findings, but the frontiers of physics have produced an increasing number of scientists who are doing so, and returning consciousness to the centre of the universe.  It is relatively unusual, however, to find a biologist who appreciates the positive implications of this for their own field;  biologists tends to be positivists, witness their strong presence in New Atheism.  Lanza's book is part of a  growing coherence in the new consciousness-centred scientific view of the universe, whose outlook, strengthened by a solid and repeatedly verified corpus of experimental evidence, is likely to supplant the current positivist view over the next century.  As physicist Amit Goswami points out, this altered outlook has profound implications for values and civilisation.  Since tin physicshe nineteenth century, a paradigm based on positivism in physics and neo-darwinism in biology has produced ideologies and outlooks justifying a dominance of the strong over the weak and the elimination of the latter. It has also resulted in a weakening of social values, also linked to the 'death' of God, as Nietschke predicted would happen, since morality no longer looks to a higher authority than ourselves.  The new science does not return us to the biblical God, but rather, in broad resonance with oriental mysticism and shamanism, guides us towards a property of Mind at the heart of nature, and by doing so, provides the tools to review the values and goals of the human racecentred on spirituality, not on materialism, but this time based not on the authority of ancient books but that of science.  Surely, for the modern world, this emergent scientific view will prove to be the soundest guide to a regenerated human civilisation which has understandably discarded the old books but has not found a new  guide to how we should live and what we should believe.  In this regard, I believe Lanza's book is one of the most important and instructive in recent times."

This book revealed a significance to that discovery by incorporating the concept of consciousness and an observer created universe.  Finally, I thought, that makes sense!  I've also delved into some of the 'spirituality' based philosophies which incorporate quantum physics and found them to feel mostly as if grasping at straws to propagate their guru-building machines.  This book brought the concept of spirituality out of the ether and into the real, individual, living realm of perception and experience.  What a fascinating new theory with which to attempt to view life and the universe!  I won't pretend to have grasped every concept here fully, but even with the basic gist, I found myself viewing myself, life and the world around me in a refreshingly new way.  This book I believe will leave the reader who is open to it feeling as if there is a familiarity to its ideas, both in the rejection of a random, dead universe, and in the innate sense that the universe is not only subjective, but subjectively created.  I hope the authors are correct that biocentrism does build momentum into a much needed life-based paradigm shift in attempting to explain the universe.  PS I am no scientist, just a regular guy, and I found this book for the most part to be very clear and understandable without the common talking-down-to language of many science or medical texts.  Highly recommended!"

Consciousness creates everything we sense; life is subjective. There is still the question of why most of us experience the same sensations, like the taste of different foods, the sight of a loved one face, etc. There has to be an agreement of some kind that is in effect that delineates what we're supposed to experience when certain stimuli occurs. I know for certain that God is because of many miracles I've personally experienced and witnessed. I believe that God is the glue that holds everything together. I also believe with the authors that free will is questionable at best. I've experienced finding out about situations years before they actually happened to me. That has led me to believe that everything is predetermined, waiting for us to experience them. Why the absence of free will freaks people out is beyond me; I take comfort in it because if I have a problem the solution is also present already before the problem even occurred. This is an excellent book; it should be required reading by everyone, including scientists."

I can image those friends telling me not to be an idiot. Everybody knows its flat, sits on an elephant that sits on a turtle. The people on the bottom would fall off if it was round. \"What are you thinking?\" Be careful you might get burnt at the stake for talking like this. It has made me speculate what is our current \"flat world\" of this new century. Lanzas wonderful book may well have described it for me. Why cant science explain what was before the big bang? Why did it happen? What exactly is it expanding into? Why hasnt it stopped expanding when their mathematics tells us it should? Why cant science explain consciousness when all of us know it exists. Well written, thought provoking and has given me my \"Flat World\" moment."

We all just assume everything goes on without us for that period of time because people tell us so. Robert Lanza takes that simple concept to an extreme. This is a fascinating book but it will take a person with a wide open mind to be able to sink teeth into. He asserts that time and space are constructs of the mind and do not, cannot, exist without consciousness perceiving them, that if all human and animal life should vanish, so would the universe. It would cease to exist as well. I recommend that you buy this book, read it for yourself and let Dr. Lanza explain it to you. It's a fascinating take on the existence of... everything."

                "Text": "`By striving to see through the veil of our ordinary perceptions, we can come closer to understanding our profound relationship to all created things'. So says acclaimed physician and life researcher Robert Lanza. In his book, Biocentrism, he has perhaps brought the reader a step or two closer to that kind of understanding.  Lanza shows that theoretical physicists, who dominate the grand search for a unified theory of life, may well be overreaching in the wrong direction. Biocentrism makes a compelling case that the consciousness that each of us as humans takes for granted is creating its own reality. While concepts like the quantum wave-particle duality and the Schrodinger's Cat paradox play a part in Lanza's presentation, the elements of his own personal story that are woven through this book help very much to make it accessible and deeply engaging. Lanza sees the ultimate mystery of consciousness as the essence of Biocentrism. Our physical bodies inevitably die away but, perhaps in the form of pure consciousness, we as conscious entities merely move on to a new reality. Lanza's message is heartfelt and life affirming, and also grounded convincingly in science...at least that which is knowable.  Scared of the grim reaper? Biocentrism may be the right antidote."

                "Text": "Lanza follows up implications in the quantum enigma of consciousness debate with some compelling ideas of the \"Of course. Why didn't I think of that?\" variety. The critically fine margins for conditions favoring life in the universe are their own argument for the creative role of consciousness in bringing form and substance to what is otherwise wave function potential. Lanza has an impressive scientific background, but his book is highly accessible to the average reader, generally free of impenetrable scientific jargon and made relevant to the common world of feelings and sentiment. His quotes from Emerson and Thoreau to illustrate points of biocentric theory are revelatory and startling in their aptness in explaining aspects of current quantum thought. I found Biocentrism to be a rich and hopeful book permeated with the consoling perception of an intimately personal universe that is not \"out there\" and to be feared, but within ourselves and tailored to our needs."

What better knowledge is there to possess than that? It may be counter-intuitive, but biocentrism is the best theory there is for explaining how the universe works.

Lanza is an entertaining writer with some clever tongue in cheek scattered throughout, and does well at introducing himself and his own personal history and credentials while focusing on the principles presented.

Of course, we are not in possession of all the answsers to the Universe and Mr Lanza does not pretend to have them all, but as Tim Freke would say, \"The Mystery of it all is so exciting.\"  Robert Lanza confirms this opinion."

But time again, much like the quantum uncertainty it relies on entirely, its quality was in wave form. It never took shape despite this observers continual desire to effect such a state.

He does a good job of deconstructing how we use our senses to define the universe, and ties quantum mechanic conundrums to the role of the conscious observer.  Lanza maintains space, time, and perception are constructs of consciousness.  On the downside he criticizes science for using theories such as string theory,which can not be tested, to build a 'theory of everything', but  proposes a new paradigm which is also beyond proof."

He supports his ideas using quantum based science but doesn't go quite far enough in answering some of the glaring questions associated with his ideas.  What he does put forth entices the reader to reconsider their view of the world by considering reality within rather from outside the world of our own consciousness.  Some concepts are difficult to wrap the mind around but force one to actively read and ponder his conclusions.  What it still does not answer for me is the question of WHY am I ME."

Biocentrism offers a sea change in how we think about consciousness and how this affects everything we see and experience.  The idea that biology and life influence our perception of the world is at the very least a fascinating alternative to  religion or atheism.  The last chapter asks \"Where Do We Go From here?\"  Although no final solution is proposed the hope that a multidisciplinary approach will incorporate biocentrism is upplifting."

Their persuasion is gentle and their analogies are fairly compelling, but the conclusions are far over the heads of laypersons. These ideas are simply too revolutionary and counterintuitive to gain traction at this particular place in \"time\" among the general population. Ultimately, though, it was not written for us, but rather for the small population of thinkers capable of grasping these concepts. That being said,  glad I read it."

This book does a fab job at lucidly illustrating the quantum experiments that defy materalistic assumptions and tie reality to the partcipating minds of the observors. Quantum experiments and quantum mathematics seem to be literally pointing to an Idealistic/Biocentric universe. It seems we no longer live in a cold and dead universe, but rather one that is fundamentally animate and alive! Or as the biologist Rupert Sheldrake would put it, the universe appears to be more like a developing living organism rather than a machine!"

He spent pages after pages writing about his past life (and now he is supposedly a successful professor), and almost made this book a self-help, fiction. Also, he has to remember that some people will pay to read his book. So, please have some respect towards your customers, and let them read a non-fiction as the title seems to suggest (if they wanted to read a self-help or a fiction, they would have picked up a completely different book. Nobody wants to read your past life when talking about science). Also, please don't disregard all the scientists who actually made today's life style possible (they may have made mistakes along the way, but remember you stand on their shoulders). Other than that, it's a great idea (and possibly not yours as other reviewers tell), and your book could have been much better without all the personal stories. Did you meet Darryl Anka (Bashar)? Because a lot of the idea seems to come from his teachings (I'm not in any way related to him. I just like his teachings)."

Because an animal with ears of some kind is not nearby...does that mean there is not compression of air molecules when a tree falls? As people die I have noticed, too that everything goes on. It is logical to say that when I die everything will continue without me, also. The laws of physics has to be a starting point of all observation. This theory takes too many liberties with Quantum Mechanics. We only see what we need to see in order to survive and reproduce, but there is so much more out there and it is driven by the laws of physics. Still, an interesting read."

These two writers cover the material in a way that almost anyone could understand.  These subjects have been described both at length and briefly but I found this writing to be the most complete and imaginative. I have only one complaint, which is a completely unreasonable one, and that is that they refuse to take the information that one more step so many of us are waiting for.  That is that final step off of the cliff of science into the infinite sea of spirituality."

Save your time and money- a sitcom would be \"deeper\" and probably have more meaning.  It's so lost and off the deep end in many ways, I won't even go into details as other one and two stars have pretty much nailed it all down.  There's no \"keys\" to be found inside these pages IMO. Bad musings, ramblings and pontificating by one who believes he's got \"answers\", while seemingly more lost than anyone else I know personally. Kinda reminds me of the research that shows most psychology majors enter that field of study as they find their own personal lives all messed up, lost, confused, etc and thus they \"study\" and get a  psychology \"degree\"  thinking they will fix themselves, while dishing out advice to others on how to supposedly fix their problems too."

                "Text": "From the outset it is clear that Robert Lanza does not understand much of the scientific studies and principals that he claims to support his theory. Furthermore he skews the view of modern physics by claiming that it is caught up in unprovable theories and fantasies and even compares it to religion. He takes shots at attempts at unifying theories like string theory for example, he rants about how theories of extra dimensions are unprovable, which by the way, is untrue. The book is filled with factual errors, wild assumptions and leaps of logic from his examples of established scientific principles to his unrelated and outlandish theories. I recommend  to anyone thinking about reading this book to first read Brian Greenes \"Fabric of the Cosmos\". Had i not read it first perhaps i too would have been impressed by Robert Lanzas seemingly authoritative take on the universe. Furthermore much of the book is comprised of long diatribes of Lanzas childhood that really have nothing to do with his theory. Also the principles of Biocentrism are redundant and erroneous. A good example of how meagre lanzas understanding of physics is, is how he asserts that space is not a physical entity but a mathematical construct used to describe the actions of objects relative to each other. This Machian view has been disproved with the creation of Einsteins general relativity and quantum physics. Another is how he grossly exaggerates the effect of probability waves on the macroscopic scale. The probability waves of the particles that make up any object above the quantum scale are so minuscule that they do not have the slightest effect on the structure of an object between being observed and unobserved. I find it actually quite sickening that such a book could be published without proper fact checking, as if it is read by someone without prior knowledge of physics then it could be quite convincing."

His idea is that we exist \"because we're possible\", in a nutshell - because the universe is one big quantum system, it exists in all physically possible states in a simultaneous superposition. Therefore, we exist simply because the arrangement of atoms that makes us up is a possible arrangement of the universe. The idea can be compounded on greatly, but not the way Lanza did. He takes this interesting idea in quantum physics (which is not as new as he insists), and turns it into his semi-religious \"life created itself\". The book is very repetitive, mostly made up of stories of him \"connecting\" with other life and realizing there must be some bigger picture. This is entirely a quantum-physical idea, yet he devotes just one chapter (more like half) to it. Don't buy."

The idea of light being the fastest anything can travel is disspelled, is one of the many notions that science is trying to wrestle with. Biocentrism says it is because of us that we don't understand it and when we think we do, another notion comes to challenge it. The limitations of homo sapien sapiens is also the limitations of science. The key concepts of science and our misunderstandings of them are well-presented in this book. The biggest bump in reading this, was how Lanza interjected his personel trials into the book. Overall, an unusal concept in science that needs more exploration and better work."

                "Text": "Readers of Owen Barfield's SAVING THE APPEARANCES will be reminded of its opening pages.  Barfield has much more to offer those who are interested in the correlative relationship between consciousness and nature.  Lanza argues that science shows there was never a time when an external, dumb, physical universe existed, or that life sprang from it at a later date; any universe that could have preceded consciousness only existed in a state of probability waves.  His arguments usefully challenge our habits of thought, but he's probably afflicted by what Barfield calls a residue of unresolved positivism (shown, e.g., in his use of \"brain\" and \"mind\" as interchangeables).  I think the best use of this book could be to prepare readers for the challenge of reading SAVING THE APPEARANCES.  There, Barfield deals with implications that Lanza doesn't seem to be aware of, e.g. with regard to the \"prehistory\" of the earth.  Barfield explores language as a way to search into the evolution of consciousness in this book and other writings.  Dale Nelson's essay \"The Troubled Legacy of Owen Barfield,\" published in TOUCHSTONE magazine, is an introduction to the late British thinker.  See Lanza's essay \"Biocentrism\" in Discover magazine May 2009, and Tim Folger's article about John Wheeler (anthropic principle) in Discover for June 2002, for introductions to ideas basic to the present book."

He regularly says nonsensical things based on results which he seems to barely understand from quantum physics. This book is just another new age con game, trying to pretend that eternal life, the soul, etc. all make sense even without a traditional religion and attempting to give them a scientific veneer."

                "Text": "Robert Lanza is a Darwinist in Consciousness clothing. He has hijacked quantum physics to explain away spirituality. Since quantum physics opened up a new world where consciousness played a role, Darwinist's had to regroup to battle against the new data. People like Richard Dawkins and Robert Lanza still feel there is still nothing beyond our experience, even if we learn that the observer plays a role in it. What Mr Lanza avoids, as he did in his interview with Deepak Chopra, is where does consciousness come from. Mr Lanza states from the interview ' Yea well we were actually evolved as monkeys in the forest trees that collect fruit and berries. We were never really designed to understand the universe.' He still pushes the Darwin mantra at the same time hijacking quantum physics. The fact is experiments that proved matter is affected by the observer Darwinist's have avoided for a long time. Only now they've decided they have to get on board to start a new spin to prevent people from opening up their own consciousness and spirituality and convince you SCIENCE has all the answers."
