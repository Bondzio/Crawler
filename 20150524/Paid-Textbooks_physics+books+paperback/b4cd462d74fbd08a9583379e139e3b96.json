                "Text": "This book is for those who for some reason find text books a little abstract and find themselves into trouble because of this. But with this books in your hands you can be sure that you'll have a second source where  to look. It's well organized, and the sample exercises are really great and  will help you all along. It starts with basic Galilean transformations,  wave mechanics, relativity and a glimpse to quantum mechanics. If you're a  student and feel the need for another source of information other than your  text books, look no further, this outline is the best out there."

                "Text": "As a college student taking Modern Physics, I found this book to be very helpful with my homework.  Many of the subjects covered in my course were found to also be in the Schaum's Outline of Modern Physics.  What it does severely lack in is explanation.  For me, I skipped using it to learn anything, and just focused on following the example problems step-by-step (with different numbers, of course!)  For the average student looking for a little help, I'd definitely suggest this book!"

It starts off fairly gently but the problems (worked and otherwise) are good and  challenging (for me at least). This book would be great companion to any  undergraduate modern physics course."

                "Text": "I am working through the book from beginning to end, so far I have found one mistake in a solved problem per chapter (the chapters are only a few pages long with roughly 10 to 12 questions for each section).  I'm a big fan of Schaum's outlines, but this one seems to be lacking in good problems and careful editing.  The answers are correct, they just have typos in the solved problems. I still like the book, but be ready to get frustrated once in a while when that isn't really a negative sign and you waste a bunch of time."
