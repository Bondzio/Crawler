                "Text": "Whether the physics in this book is perfect or not, one thing is certain: the physics is readable. This is not a book for the aspiring physicist, I made that mistake. This is a book for a person curious about some of the major developments in the subject but NOT interested in the minutia and the math behind the theory. Physics is not just for nerds with overpowered calculators, anybody can be fascinated by this stuff."

                "Text": "This is a decent book when it comes to discussing the philosophical  implications of physics, but its discussions of the concrete physics are  lacking.  There are many typos and ambiguous problems, and in some cases  important concepts are actually explained incorrectly.  Only buy this book  if you are already conversant with the physics it discusses  (thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativity) and want to read about  the history and philosophy of them."

I'm glad it was assigned, because it really prepared me for lecture, during which the content was covered too quickly to take hold. Rather, here are explanations with examples catering to the non-physics and non-mathematics major that also doesn't waste too much time on extraneous information. Much appreciated."
