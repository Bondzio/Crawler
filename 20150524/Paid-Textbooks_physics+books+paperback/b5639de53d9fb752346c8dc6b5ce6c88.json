                "Text": "With so many elementary particle physics books written about String Theory and higher dimensions as of late (many of which are excellent books) it's getting harder to find up to date data from a reductionist, or, as author Gordon Kane refers to them in his own book on the topic, \"Phenomenologist\" point of view. While I tend to personally believe the String Theorists, I'm never satisfied until I hear (or read as the case may be) from both sides. And this book does a fine point of explaining things from the reductionist point of view. The science is very thick, and many formulas are just too complex for the layman to grasp, so people who are new to quantum theory and particle physics should perhaps start with more \"softcore\" physics books. I confess that I read this book cover to cover, and put it down before grasping 100% of the concepts presented within. I had purchased the book after reading the String Theory works, and the unavoidable mention of reductionism's many success' motivated me to purchase a few books dedicated to the subject. After following this path of readership, this book answered a lot of the questions I still had, and cleared up other subjects that I didn't believe were so well defined."

                "Text": "Martinus Veltman has a rare gift - to have indepth knowledge of a complex subject, and be able to give the layman a plausible explanation of it. I have almost completed my second reading of the book. Such was the wealth of information, and my eagerness to read, that I could not take it all in on the first reading. The reader must persist with some of Dr Veltman's language quirks , but this is a minor criticism - the effort is handsomely repaid. His character profiles (occasionally caricatures), and personal stories, add a human dimension, and serve to point out that it takes many brilliant and hard working people, not just theorists and not just Nobel Prize winners, to create an edifice as grand (and yet fragile) as the Standard Model. Highly commended - a beautiful legacy for future generations."

                "Text": "I am not a particle physicist but I am aspiring to work in the field. So, I wanted to learn, at least at the undergraduate level some more on the theory of particle physics. Now, this book is almost entirely narrative and you need to start making lists of things like quark transactions in order for it to make logical sense. This subject can't be treated strictly in narrative. After you read it its not likely that you will be able to quantify anything but that defect is offset by the low price of the book. The kindle edition is only 15.00. So if you are the kind of person that just wants a cursory understanding of the subject its good, but if you are a serious student of the subject I would pass it up."

If you really want to learn, then this book would be great. For a beginner non scientist like myself, I really liked \"Particle Physics: A Very Short Introduction\" by Frank Close, and the chapter on the Standard Theory in \"The Particle Garden\" by Gordon Kane. I can't wait to read \"Particle Physics: A Beginner's Guide by Brian Martin\", since it has good reviews."

I have read enough books and looked up info on the net to grasp the sense of quantum theory and it's counterparts, Read \"Parallel Worlds\" By Michio Kaku, He describes things so easily. 4 stars because no book is a five yet for me except the book previously Mentioned because of it's simplicity and wide variety of topics covered.

Brief bios of famous physicists appear throughout the book, but appear to have been severely edited to fit on one page.  I would have enjoyed more of the author's anecdotes.  I am not sure what audience this book was aimed at.  Some technical background could be assumed, but the author belabors obvious points and is often repetitious.  It could have used an edit to tighten some of the material.  The book is printed on glossy, heavy stock."
