                "Text": "I really love this book. It shows you all kinds of cool techniques to solve difficult integrals. Until now there hadn't been many books like this. Maybe Victor Moll's Irresistible integrals was one that I like. Victor Moll is also coming out with a collection of papers where he solves from integrals from gradshteyn and ryzhik. That also is nice. I think with more integration techniques being taught we can make the normal calculus curriculum to not just ponder over mediocre results. It's nice that pure calculus as a research field is still alive. My only gripe about the book is that it seems to be typeset in Mathtype rather than latex. Some of the derivations show too much detail. You can say do this substitution and you arrive at this formula. I like that the style is not abstract math but more down to earth calculations like a physicist might do. It would have been nice to see some things done using mathematica, because Maple is not that great. I definitely encourage you to buy this book there are not many like it."
