                "Text": "I found the title of this book somewhat misleading. It is only the very end of the book that gets into \"before the beginning,\" and most of the book is simply a preparation for this ending. Most of the book is simply a rehash of what is already readily available in a dozen other popular books on cosmology, although it does reference some of the latest discoveries, such as extrasolar planets. If you're really interested in what it might be like \"before the beginning,\" Guth's _The Inflationary Universe_ is far superior. I'm nudging this book above average (6) because the last few chapters do contain some fascinating material on the nature of the cosmological constants that provides food for thought."

                "Text": "Sir Martin Rees is Astronomer Royal. How he managed to obtain this lofty position while maintaining his ability to speak English is beyond me. Like Carl Sagan and Lynn Margulis, Sir Martin is able to explain some rather complicated and complex ideas in small, easily managed chunks. He has the ability to entertain us, like Michio Kaku, while at the same time, imparting us with a lasting understanding of many of life's really big questions. I have read perhaps 3,000 books (mostly science based) in my tenure as resident of this planet and have written several. I have also written dozens of book reviews for various media.  However, the concepts put down in Rees book flow quite eloquently, positively, and manageably---which is indeed rare. The difference between this book's take on such things as life in the universe, black holes, and the beginning of time are easily set part from their Pseudoscientific counterparts---they make perfect sense. I would like to say that \"if you buy one book on cosmology this year--buy this one.\" But I wont. Simply pick up a copy, thumb through a few chapters and it will sell itself. This book is a must read for any high school student who believes physics or science are boring. Or, for the adult non-scientist that has a desire to know. I gave this book \"5 stars\" because \"6\" was not an option. Even I gleaned a bit of education-and that's never a bad thing. A definite MUST own."

It represents a drastic enlarging of our cosmic perspectives - the cosmos is more spectacular by far than we could have imagined. He also believes that the apparent fine-tuning that our existence depends on cannot be a coincidence. What we call the universe is likely to be just one member of an ensemble, but ours may be in an unusual subset that permits complexity and consciousness to develop. Our universe could be an atom in an infinite collection, a cosmic archipelago in which impassable barriers prohibit communication between the islands. Quoting scientists like Hawking, Chandrasekar and others throughout, the author broadens our understanding of cosmology and quantum science while offering unique and interesting new perspectives on our views of consciousness and existence. Highly recommended."

While it is true that only a small portion of the book is devoted to the fascinating  topic of the multiverse one can always use the backdrop of real proven  science in such a vaporous field, and 95% of readers could use a refresher  in the other topics of astronomy anyway. The entire book is excellent and  enjoyable for anyone with a basic grasp of astronomy and cosmology."

                "Text": "Martin J. Rees presents us with a biography of our home, the cosmos.  He shows us the coincidence that has happened for the complexity of our life to evolove on this planet.  He seems also doubtful that it has happened anywhere else, but that this might be explained naturally by the multiverse, (chances are greater with more universes evolving)  rather than the Anthropic Principle.  Well, he thinks that we should properly term it \"Anthropic Reasoning.\"  And this is a theory he seems a bit regretful of.  (doesn't think interface with philosophers and theologians is, in principle, and different from what it was in Newton's day) \"It would be a pity if theoretical physicists took anthropic ideas too seriously, as it might diminish their motivation for seeking unified theories.\"  And he does talk a good deal about these unified theories, the relationship with quantum effects and general relativity, and even briefly introduces the reader to super-strings.  Also educates us on the niche of other empyreal phenomena like dark matter and black holes, and how every one of the things I'm mentioning relates one to another.  He discusses the Big Bang, why we are sure of its validity, and its other implications, which includes the future, our universe's Eschaton.  This book is a decent look at the state of Cosmological studies and some of the methodologies of observing this grand and bizarre place that emerged almost  ex nihilo."

If you are not up on science and math, it can be some pretty slow slogging, though.  There are too many asides in footnotes, which I consider \"speed bumps\" for readers. Why not just put what you want to say in the body of the text?  One problem that I think Rees has is that he forgets who his target audience is.  He'll take the time to explain some simple, and not too relevant, item (e.g.;definition of an isotope) and then launch into a very complex principle of cosmology at breakneck speed as if he were talking to a colleague.  With all that, the ideas Rees presents of how the universe developed and the possibility of multiple universes is fascinating."

                "Text": "This book is a strong introduction to several major astronomical concepts. It covers a lot and is at times a little disorganized but is well written, clear and stimulating. It is accessible to the novice but its preciseness and density enables to acquire more advanced than just basic knowledge.  It could use a 2nd edition by now though, as some of the topics have been the subjects of recent discoveries such as the theory of \"brown dwarves\".  What the reader will definitely not learn is what happened \"before the beginning\". Nobody knows that and the title is deceptive in that way. I believe Rees meant it as opposed to the biblical \"In the beginning...\". In the absence of evidence, Rees seems to refuse to even consider that Humanity might have been planned before or at the big bang. To his credit, he seems perfectly content to study and write books about the multiverse in a world before there was a bible, before there was a \"In the Beginning...\". Hence the title. Rees makes too much of a point of it though, probably to differentiate himself from other popular astronomers."

The writing is brisk and Rees avoids mathematical formulas entirely. He provides some historical context to most of the theories discussed and his personal anecdotes are a nice respite. I was disappointed, however, that the text does not include a single figure or illustration. Not one. Moreover, Rees's clear exposition cannot avoid an inescapable fact: cosmology is really hard, and there are a lot of unanswered, and possibly unanswerable, questions. While the book is carefully edited to appeal to a wide audience, readers without some background in physics and chemistry may be frustrated. The notes are also more maddening than helpful, because they require turning to the back of the book only to discover, in most cases, that the analysis in the main text is a gross oversimplification. Do not get me wrong: I am glad I read the book and it has stimulated further interest in the subject, which I assume is what Rees hoped to accomplish. But I have to wonder if the readership of \"Business Week\" is populated with much smarter folks than I ever imagined."

                "Text": "This book is very well written, but to get the actual Planck time value of 5.3906*10^-44 seconds, I had to do a web search. The formula of Sqrt(G*hbar/c^5) wasn't in the book either... in fact the book almost entirely lacks formulas of any kind. I suppose this is very good if you are writing for 6th graders who have to look up the big words, but that makes this not an adult book at all, no matter how well written and how eminent the scholar that wrote it. Cosmology is a subject where all of science comes together in a \ufffdbig picture\ufffd, but the details are very important as Dr. Rees explains. Just how they are important seems to be beyond our understanding? Only in a world where papers by Cambridge scholars are either totally unreadable with jargon or dumbed down beyond any real use! Dr. Wheeler still includes mathematics in his books, thankfully!"

I read better books on the subject. Moreover, there is nothing in this book that talks about \"before the begining\" of the universe. It should be titled \"before the begining: This is the way I want you to think\"...! I am sorry!"
