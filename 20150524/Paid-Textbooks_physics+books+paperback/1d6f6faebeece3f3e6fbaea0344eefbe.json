                "Text": "As usual, the best physics books are short and to the point, as is this one. The two Dirac lectures may serve as a perfectly good mini physics course all by themselves.  I always enjoy a Feynman lecture, and this is  no exception. He cuts to the chase without sacrificing the plot. But, I  must say, in this case the Wienberg lecture is the better of the two.  Weinberg's style has a particular grace & beauty about it that gently  exposes the aesthetic meaning of the search for a picture of nature."

                "Text": "Feynman's lecture is the simplest and the most intuitive explanation of the connection between spin and statistics that I have ever seen! This is a very readable book, no knowledge of quantum field theory is required, but a good understanding of relativity and quantum mechanics is essential for understanding the book. I think every physicist should read these lectures, although very simple, they add a lot to our understanding and even to our knowledge of fundamental physics."
