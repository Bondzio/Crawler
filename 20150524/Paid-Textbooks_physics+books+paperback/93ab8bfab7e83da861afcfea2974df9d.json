Easy to read, great problems with explanations and overall very high quality. I definitely recommend it to anyone planning on taking the AP Physics C tests."

Though the book is concised in some parts but its compliancy for Indian students especially is corroborate success !! No significant mistake I noticed in my reading through book."

                "Text": "If you are taking C, I strongly suggest picking this up. Mechanics was pretty easy but E&M; could be a struggle at times. Thankfully, this book seems to focus mostly on E&M; and makes daunting concepts easy to understand. In conjunction with Viren's AP Physics review videos (google him, it can be monumentally helpful), Physics C could even be approached as a self study (I did it, so can you)."
