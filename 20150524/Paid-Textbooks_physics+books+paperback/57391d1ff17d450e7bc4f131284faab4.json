                "Text": "This book is for the electricity and magnetism portion of physics.  The way  concepts are explained is very helpful; however, the examples in this book are only reasonably helpful.  Some of the problems that are given at the end of the chapter are super difficult and the caliber of questioning from within the chapter (the examples) to post-chapter (problems at the end of the chapter) is a wide range.  While the examples will help you with the more easier problems, when you get to the more difficult problems you might find yourself stuck and not knowing what to do.  That's just me though.  I didn't consult the book as often as I should have so some concepts I know super well while others, it's fuzzier.  Overall, this book is a helpful tool to have beyond just teacher's lectures. This book explains the concepts well and if you can understand the concepts then you should be golden."
