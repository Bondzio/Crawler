                "Text": "This isn't \"philosophy of physics for dummies\" by any stretch, but for someone who last took physics in 1975 and who only has taken an intro to philosophy course, this was an excellent overview of historical and modern philosophy of the physics of space and time.  The author uses next to no math (thank goodness) and his prose expositions are clear and to the point.  I imagine the book would also appeal to those with more knowledge of both subjects, as the author suggests that some of his positions are controversial.  I'm looking forward to part 2 on matter based upon his exposition of space and time in this volume.  Highly recommended."

                "Text": "As a progressive rock band, Gentle Giant was always a bit different. Avoiding the virtuoso-hero ideals and overblown symphonic textures of their contemporaries, GG blended Elizabethan themes with 20th century music (Stravinsky and Bartok being obvious influences) and out-and-out RAWWK. The result was a sort of rock and roll chamber music, and whatever lyrical weaknesses they had were rendered inconsequential by their incredible sense of adventure and unbelievable contrapuntal jams. They were simply one of the very best instrumental ensembles rock has ever seen. And though they put out a number of amazing albums, \"In a Glass House\" is in my opinion their greatest. The diverse elements that GG showcased on their other seminal albums are all here, but in this album they are synthesized most successfully into a coherent whole that makes philosophical and artistic sense--a true progressive rock model that would make coherent sense even today, at least more so than the mellotron-driven bombast of most of their peers. Some of this stuff sounds downright Alternative--especially the dissonant, polyrhythmic prog-punk of \"Way of Life.\" The production is intimate, driving, and crystal-clear, with John Weathers driving drums (the John Bonham of progrock) right in your face whenever he is playing. The album is emotionally and intellectually gripping throughout. In short, it is a progrock masterpiece. Buy it. P.S. The last bonus live track is rough sledding, but the first one is incredible."
