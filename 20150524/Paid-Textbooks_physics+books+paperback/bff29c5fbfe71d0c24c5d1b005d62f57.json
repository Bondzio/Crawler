                "Text": "Reading these Apogee books is like leafing through a thick stack of mimeographs. Robert Godwin's decision to leave the documents essentially \"as-is\" (leaving spelling and punctuation errors, for example)  and to publish as much relevant material as he could find in the archives  (similar, but not identical reports) allows you, the reader, to process the  information yourself, as if you had gone to the archives to do research. If  as a reader you are uncomfortable with the idea of developing the narrative  on your own out of this raw material, these books may not be for you."

                "Text": "If you're a space enthusiast, then the NASA Mission Reports being collected by Robert Godwin and printed by Apogee Press are for you.  Each book essentially consists of a number of NASA documents printed for the  media that describe details of the flight (e.g., the Press Kit).  Separately, the original documents contained in these books would cost  hundreds of dollars.  Reprints of individual press kits alone would cost as  much as the price of this book.  The only problem is the poor reproduction  of many of the black and white figures.  They were obviously scanned--and  often at low resolution.  The important information is still there,  however, and it shouldn't detract from their value as a reference."

                "Text": "The good point about this book is the technical detail.  For example,  a big cut-away diagram of the first stage rocket showing fuel delivery system and nozzles.  Also,  complete launch sequence.  The biggest disappointment  was the fact that the whole book consists of pre-mission reports,  and only  the very briefest post-mission report.  Where are the post-mission reports?  Also disappointing is the fact that one report is almost identical to  another!  Some of the reports were scanned in,  and so contain frequent  spelling errors.  Overall,  worth it for the detailed technical stuff."

Also, the publisher is reaping a profit using public domain material, repackaging it, throwing in a CD-ROM,etc.  Easy profit margin--you don't have to  generate the material at your expense (the tax payer paid for it, the  publisher repackages it, and sells it back to the tax payer).  Well, I at  least give 'em credit for being smart marketers."
