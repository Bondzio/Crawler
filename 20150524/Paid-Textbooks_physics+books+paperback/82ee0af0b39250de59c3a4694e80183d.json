                "Text": "This study guide was just ok, better than nothing , its pretty much the only one out there. The most important thing to keep in mind is this test in Florida is fast paced. DONT GET BEHIND!!!! The study guide doesn't have much to say in this area but if you want to pass this test first time through have a strategy that keeps you on pace. I used time markers (1.6 minutes per question) at 30 minutes , half way, and 3/4 to make sure I was on pace with 10 minutes reserved to go back to either skipped questions or question that needed double checking. I kept the marked/skipped question limit at 10. I passed but it was an intense 150 minutes. Remember you have plenty of time before you press start on the test to get organized."
