                "Text": "This is a review of the 6th edition, published in 2009. A new edition has come out every 4-5 years since the first edition came out in 1985, so check before you buy to make sure you're getting the latest and greatest. Anyway, this is a super dictionary. Its 596 pages of concise, clearly written definitions are accompanied by helpful illustrations, charts and tables. There are 6-7 definitions per page, on average, which means there are around 4,000 definitions in the book. A 20-page appendix of tables, timelines and lists is on pages 597-616. Typographically, it's a beautiful book. This is a great reference for libraries, college students, and working professionals in a wide range of industries."

That being said I hate the cover art.  Oxford Products usually have a nice plain to the point cover which is great.  I have covered mine with masking tape because I get motion sickness every time I look at it.  If you think it looks bad in the picture wait til you see it in person. I would give five stars for a different cover."
