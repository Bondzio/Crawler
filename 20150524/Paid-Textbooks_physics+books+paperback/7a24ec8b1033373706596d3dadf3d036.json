                "Text": "I immensely enjoyed studying this statistical mechanics book. I think that the author, James Sethna, has a \"Feynman-like\" ability to explore his subject matter with much depth, insight, and many playfully creative excursions. The exercises cover such topics as the thermodynamics of Dyson Spheres and black holes; of how many shuffles it takes to fully randomize a card deck; and of whether an advanced, intelligent being or civilization can, from a thermodynamic standpoint, manage to process an infinite number of thoughts before the heat death of the universe, or whether they are limited to a finite number of thoughts. I think that there is a lot of wisdom and insights in this book which is missing in other books I've read on statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, where I often feel overwhelmed by a zoo of partial derivatives and thermodynamic equations with little guidance given on how the entire structure fits together. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who has studied some statistical mechanics and/or thermodynamics in a lower-level undergraduate course, and is looking for more advanced upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level text."

                "Text": "This books is reader friendly and very interesting. In the chapter about correlation function & linear response theory, the demonstration is very clear and self-consistent. As a student who is new to this topic, I think this chapter is even better than Chandler's book on this topic( I love Chandler's intro too). The problem set seems to be stimulating and may need more time than learning the main text. And more, the appendix is on Fourier Transform, a saver to the chemistry student like me."
