                "Text": "The human body is so complex with so many different systems, that it still inspires wonder even in today's scientists. \"Physics of the Human Body\" discusses the science of the physics behind the human body, and does not just focus on the exterior gross motor skills of movement and muscles. Everything from the movement of blood through the circulatory system to how our bodies maintain their heat, \"Physics of the Human Body\" is a fascinating and very highly recommended read, a choice addition to any biological science collection."
