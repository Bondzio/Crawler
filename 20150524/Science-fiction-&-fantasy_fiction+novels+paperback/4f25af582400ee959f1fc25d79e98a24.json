Here, he is a genetic experiment that has run amok, and is currently draining the life of anyone or anyting he comes in contact with, leaving them dried up husks.  One of the victims is Gwen Stacy herself, cauisng a horrid tragedy in Peter's life.  The problem is Gwen's death was foreshadowed since the last volume ended, so unless you're under the age of 3, you'll have seen her unfortunate end coming a while ago.  Not only that, but the final fight sequence between Peter and Carnage, is, as are the battles in the other books, extremely rushed, killing all feeling.  Once again, the cliche of Peter quitting and eventually forced to take Spider-man back up is also involved.  Sheesh, the only thing missing is yet another person finding out Peter's Spider-man.  C'mon, Bendis?  Do you really think the readers are THAT dumb?  Just because the book's for slightly younger doesn't mean he needs to dumb everything down.  Yet another poor case of of over-hype around Brain Micheal Benids.
