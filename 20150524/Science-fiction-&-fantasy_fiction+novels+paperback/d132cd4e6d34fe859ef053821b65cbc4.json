I was somewhat skeptical as I began reading, but was quickly drawn in.  It has all the elements of an excellent novel.  The characters are well defined, believable and easy to relate to.  The plot, however fictitious, is grounded in reality and calls attention to a truly catastrophic, yet largely ignored threat to international security.  The plot and pacing are first rate, as the story never dragged or failed to hold my interest.  More importantly, it made me *care* about the people and events as I read.

I have been on a post-apocalyptic reading jag for a while now, and this novel is in the middle of the pack for me. It moves right along, contains only a few errors (wretch when author means retch, as in to dry heave, strait when the author means straight, as in straight hair.) Having read more than a few novels which clearly hadn't been edited, read aloud by the author, or even run through a spell-checker, I appreciate what I used to take for granted in a novel - that I wouldn't be bumped out of it constantly by blatant errors in spelling, punctuation, formatting, etc. There are several pretty decent plain language explanations of how an EMP creates the destruction that it does, which are helpful to anybody who doesn't understand it to begin with. SPOILER ALERT:I will say that I was never in any real doubt that Kyle would make it home. It would have been a nice twist if he had frozen to death and Rose had found his journal and some months or years later it had gotten to Jenn. Not nice in the sense that it would have been a nice outcome for the character, but nice in the sense that the reader's expectations have been upended, and now they really need to pay attention because they don't know what's coming next. But a tidy little novel, a happy ending, nice motivation to prepare for the unexpected if you haven't yet begun to do so. For me, the best post-EMP novel remains One Second After. But this novel is worth the $3.99 Kindle price if you enjoy these types of stories. I would encourage the author to make his next novel more complex, and include more of the challenges any community would face after an EMP event. He alluded to the better prepared people in Deer Creek not participating in the council, leaving people in need with not much to give to try to figure things out. This really could have been a source for a lot of juicy conflict. Does the council send emissaries to ask these better-prepared people for help? What kind of reception do they receive? What is the response, the rationale for either helping or not? I'm giving this novel three stars; I'd give One Second After four stars, and save five stars for Cormac McCarthy's The Road.", "Helpfulness": 0.8055555555555556, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Q1IMENIWPFZJ"}}, {"Date": "on July 13, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7636363636363637, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3ANK3VYPWVCOK"}}, {"Date": "on August 2, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7906976744186046, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2V436XK9BESEE"}}, {"Date": "on October 27, 2012", "Text": "This is a great idea looking for a good writer.

I think not because half of the book (that takes place in Montana) revolves around the perverted Sheriff trying to rape one of the main characters.  I don't have a problem with reviewers saying this author has right wing leanings.  I think most of these survival stories are like that and it doesn't bother me as a total \"lefty\".  I suppose all liberal humans would just die on the first day of an EMP attack. I do wonder though if all \"right wing types\" think women are so useless except for sex. This was a silly book, a painfully strange way of going about writing a love story.  After reading this book and Lights Out, I feel I should amend my review of The Pulse to a higher rating.

Enjoyably, this work is written fairly well. The author has taken the trouble to edit his work avoiding the all to common misspellings which seem to plague so many ebooks. I do have a few criticism which did annoy me while reading. Firstly, the main character is presented as hypersensitive and somewhat effeminate in many circumstances. Mostly, it is an inconsistent trait which seems in place because the author is trying to make a statement about the good husband, good father and good human. I don't begrudge him this as out of place elements are typical when authors try to make statements. In the same vein, the protagonist is presented as a rational, reasonable and of at least average intelligence, yet time and time again he seems to turn his brain off and do something so stupid that I ended up with my face in my palm. Furthermore, he seems to lack any ability to learn from his mistakes as he does the same thing over again which had just nearly cost him his life (which he inexplicably and miraculously escapes). This is an all to common lazy element for writers to introduce the next conflict/action sequence. It really is not needed in a world gone to hell where even if someone does everything right, circumstance beyond their control can still bite them in the posterior. It would have been more palatable if the character had been introduced as suffering from schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder as this would at least explain the discordant behaviour. This is equally applicable to the female lead in dealing or rather not dealing with the possible rape and threat to her children. The author also seems to have at least a subconscious dislike of firearms (at a minimum he dislikes keeping track of them or explaining what happend to what would be a most precious possession). There are points in the story where firearms are not used, even if a bluff, which would avoid a conflict. At other points in the story a gun is used stupidly and dangerously. Thankfully, anyone with even a touch of critical thinking ability will spot that the characters idiocy is to blame for trouble rather than a firearm. Lastly, the author seems to have grown tired of telling his tale and just drops it at the end. The protaganist makes it to the stateline, hop, skip and a jump later he is home, the end. To wrap up, if you are like me and enjoy this genre you will be able to overlook any of my perceived flaws in the writing and still enjoy the read.

That didn't happen here - I believe I found one misspelling. The storyline never dragged during the fleshing out of the plot and the building of the characters.  Instead, the story built in a continuously progressive manner and maintained my interest without the use of fantastic and unusual events giving the reader the feeling that everything described could have actually happened and I appreciated that very much.  As a hardcore survivalist, the reason I read this material is to envision the possible unfolding of disastrous situations and how to mentally prepare for certain possibilities and this story actually gave me all of that in a very entertaining form.  I was able to consider the things the character did and what I would have done in his place at each step along the story way. I was also able to develop variations on the situations that develop and consider what I would do in those situations as well.  The story was very thought provoking and the author's ability to describe the events with expansive detail was well noted and appreciated.

I love survival stories.  I've read many books like this, and even had the opportunity to edit one for a popular author in this arena.  Mr. Gorham did a marvelous job writing this book and using descriptive language to help the reader form a picture of the scenario in his or her mind.  I am impressed that he stayed away from using the hard core survivalist stereotype: the \"man who thought ahead of everything and has all the answers, including a stock of military clothing for when the SHTF\".  I was also impressed that the book started with an actual scenario from a 1962 nuclear test and related the actual effects of an EMP.  I have seen survival blogs wrestle with discussions about what will actually work or fail electronically and for the first time, I felt I had a clear picture of what to expect post-EMP.  I was surprised to learn that in 1962, some auto ignitions failed after that nuclear test was conducted over 900 miles away at an altitude of about 250 miles up. BRAVO!  A real life example with facts, not speculation.  Great descriptions of human behavior!  I saw an earlier comment about punctuation; who cares?  Can't wait to read your next book!

Without being preachy, the author conveys a deep sense of love and faith in a manner that anyone of good-will can feel good about.

I loved this book and have already recommended it to friends. I am a big fan of survivalist fiction and read a lot of it. I put this book up there with \"One Second After\" and I actually liked it a better than \"Patriots\" as it moved a lot quicker. Ray Gorham is an outstanding author. I never would have guessed this was a first book for him. More than once I thought, \"that was intelligently written.\" I don't know how many pages this book was since it's only in the Kindle edition, but I found myself wishing it was longer so I could get more story.

This novel is clear, concise, and gripping. I liked the characters and the scenes were perfectly described.

After reading the Amazon-provided preview, I could tell that the book was written in a style that would keep my interest, so I bought it.  I read it and loved it so much that I emailed the author to thank him personally, and he even responded very courteously to my email, which surprised me.  I've read the other reviews for this book, both the top and the bottom.  I think the criticisms of the one-star reviews are unfair and vicious.  The book contains a few homonym slip-ups and stretches the rules of Oxford English (like a tendency to put apostrophes on plural nouns) but if you're going to get your panties in a bunch over a few misplaced words in a SELF-PUBLISHED, nearly 300-page novel, go get a job as an editor, SAT grader, or English teacher, and stop tearing apart the first efforts of a first-time author.  The book is written from a distinctly conservative worldview, though it's certainly not as onerous as it could be, but if you're a raging liberal, you probably won't enjoy it. Don't read it and then whine because someone wrote a book which reflects their own way of thinking.  The characters aren't phenomenally complicated or innovative, but not everyone has to have some sort of giant secret or second personality in order to be interesting.  The book is written from the perspective of the characters, so their choices or alternatives aren't always explained.  I think that makes it more real - that there are possibilities which the characters don't think about is in keeping with the desperate nature of the situations they are in.  They need to act, not sit around planning out all of their alternatives.  The story purposely focuses on the two main characters, Kyle and Jenn, instead of delving into the (admittedly interesting) side plots of the other survivors.  Perhaps future works could build on this? Kyle is a simple, honest man just trying to get home to his family.  He doesn't have the deviousness or viciousness of character necessary to be a killer, and he relies heavily on the kindness of strangers to survive.  Readers may interpret this as being a weakness, and it's true that things work out just a little *too* coincidentally well for him in some places, but at its heart this is not a survival story.  If I may quote the author's words, \"My goal when starting to write was to tell a story about a couple overcoming immense challenges to stay together, and stay true to each other, the EMP aspect was just a way to put them in that situation. \"  There you have it.  If you want good disaster literature, look somewhere else.  This is a fairly simple story of honor and dedication, characters with a refreshingly strong morality in today's \"feel-good morality\" and \"every man for himself\" society (both in the real and literature worlds).", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2FIGLNN2PU5SU"}}, {"Date": "on August 17, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A334O1EVCA7H89"}}, {"Date": "on August 1, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3EVMG0WJDNBJG"}}, {"Date": "on July 31, 2012", "Text": "I was presently surprised with this book from a new author.

I got some good ideas from the characters in the book that were prepared and how their preparation was beneficial for others.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not one to scare myself into the extremes but got a real sense of how grateful I am to live in Montana, out in the country, living next to family enjoying the many freedoms I and my family have.  I've lived out of the country before and understand the lack of government, law enforcement and civility at times of crisis so I could relate somewhat to the situation or the lack of some basic necessities in that case.

There were several scenes that were quite gripping and tense. There were several scenes where I thought the main characters were going to choose the less-than-moral choice, but was pleasantly surprised when they didn't. I'm not sure how realistic that was, but it made for a satisfying read. The explanation of an EMP and how it could occur seemed realistic and well-written. I'm giving it only four stars because I felt that more could've been done with the characters than there was. For example, the politician featured early on seems to be important, but we never really find out what happens to her, other than that she's waiting to die. I would like to have seen her play a more prominent role in the plot line. I think marauding gangs would've been a much bigger problem than was shown in this novel. Another novel that I read about EMP's, \"One Second After\", by William R. Forstchen, uses this and I think it is much more realistic than the few people that the main character in this novel runs across. I enjoyed the main characters' writing of the journal as he's traveling. I worried about it getting ruined in the snow, and would have liked to have seen more talked about on that. I also think the novel would have been better if it had been lengthened out by adding some more weather difficulties after the one storm. One big storm didn't seem like very much considering that winter was coming on. I would also like to have seen more about what happened to the son after he was injured; his struggle to survive and so on.

Flat characters, stilted dialog with very unnatural conversation structure.  The character of Kyle is so illogical in his choices, I am surprised he survived more than a week.  As for Jenn, it appears that the author either has limited insight into the complexity and capabilities of women or purposely created this weak, stereotyped character because it was an easy, if somewhat obvious, way to create tension on both sides of the story line.  He would have been well served to have this book rough edited to help with that character's creation and development.  As others have noted. If you are searching for an EMP apocalypse novel, start with \"One Secong After\" or \"Lights Out\". Both of which have, to some degree, the same failings but redeem themselves with much deeper exploration of the societal impact of this kind of an event.

Government will take care of its own first, through secret facilities or through martial law. The journey that Kyle has taken in this book will be typical of those caught up in the events of a catastrophe, trust of fellow human beings slowly destroyed by animal behavior, the constant hunt for food, water and shelter, the need to kill to save yourself and your family from bandits and murderers. Kyle handles things well, except for the decision to pull a cart of supplies behind him for 1500 miles. He would have been much better served by a bicycle with a basket, which would have given him the ability to cover 50 miles a day in the flat lands and to coast down the long hills.

The main character Kyle Trait, got stuck in Texas while trying to fly home to his family in Montana. When the attack occurs, he almost dies when his plane almost crashes but amazingly does not. From that point on, the roller coaster ride begins.  He goes through a lot to get home to his family. He has to walk and along the way is confronted by both the best and worst of mankind. As in real life, the best of man helps overcome evil and helps Kyle along the way. The story also talks about how the attack has affected his family back home and their struggling. During several scenes, I actually almost started crying and cheering (inwardly of course) any time Kyle would overcome a seeming insurmountable obstacle.

Amazing characters and realistic situations with just the right amount of suspense kept me glued.

But considering this is an indie, it's a small, passing issue easily forgiven in light of the excellent story. I'm used to typos in Indies, since the editing process is less structured, but I think I only spotted one.  I was also impressed by the diversity of the characters and the way in which the author made us aware of the diversity without the Eurocentric slant often used by Caucasian authors. Only one plot hole seemed apparent to me and that was a startling lack of assistance to the affected area in the immediate aftermath of disaster.  But it did make another real-world problem stand out: When your government is dysfunctional, and refuses to invest in renewable infrastructure for National Security, a nation becomes a sitting duck for an EMP.

If the power grid of the United States and all that it supports were destroyed, our life support system would suddenly stop.  The main character in this story is stranded in Texas and needs to make it back to Montana, where his wife and children live. The characters in the story are upset and inconvenienced, but the reader never gets a true sense of a life-threatening desperation.  With all transportation, communication devices, and all electrical systems fried, there would be no food deliveries, no medical supplies, no running water, cars would not run, and planes would not fly.  Within weeks, if not days, millions of people would find themselves hungry, thirsty, and especially in cities, with no way of alleviating these basic needs.  Mr. Gorham lightly touched on this, then promptly forgot there are about 300 million people in the United States, about 90 million of them in the Western U.S. where our main character is traveling, for the most part alone, in a scenario reminiscent of The Road.

But it's worth reading anyway.  I had it up at 4 stars, but then I remembered the beginning of the novel and the explanation about the terrorists and such.  It was kind of offensive to Iranians.  I get that the US and Iran have disagreements and Iran is the next door neighbor to the country that the US invaded, but I really don't like how he pinned the whole disaster on us, in a matter of like 2 paragraphs as if everyone was just supposed to accept that of course the Iranians were behind it.  Annoying.  I know someone had to be the culprit, but why not at least make it a country that the US is at war with?  It would be more realistic.  Since we never hear from \"Jibril\" and \"Zahir\" again, why even bother writing that part?  He could have just said \"the terrorists\" and moved on since it wasn't even important to the story.

I was hooked early on in reading your book \"77 Days in September\". I found it to be a great mix of adventure, survival, and a depiction of what true love between a man and a woman is all about. I haven't thought about the need for being prepared for any type of calamity, let alone the terrible after effects of a potential EMP.
