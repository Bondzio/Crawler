Nelson. I was kept spell bound by the rich, if sometimes mind bending world she had created. The heroine, Marissa, is a tough as nails, no nonsense character who attracts disaster like it's going out of fashion. The secondary characters were intriguing and I hope are fleshed out more in further novels.

Here he is a Fairy Godfather and he can grant wishes for a price.  Marissa Locks is one of his agents as a result of one of those wishes.  Her parents sold her to Grimm In return for her sisters health. There is quite a bit of world building and character development required for Free Agent.  All of that is done as a part of story line.  The plot is complicated and the results sometimes surprising.  It is a good story to set  up the series.  Many things are solved in Free Agent and with the solutions come the hooks for future stories featuring Grimm and Marissa.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AX0ZTNX6KVJ40"}}, {"Date": "on August 5, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A12IY2EKPI7XIK"}}, {"Date": "on September 1, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3ENYA8J9OCOBW"}}, {"Date": "on October 30, 2014", "Text": "A fresh new voice in urban fantasy.
