Except for a very few \"bad\" words, there's really nothing to be offended by here. Fairly bloodless violence, no sex. But I didn't find this in the teen literature section which is what kind of aggravates me. Yet it seems like teen literature. Yet I don't think most teens would get a lot of the references.

This is a really good book! I don't know if I can give a 100% spoiler free review so read at your own risk: there is a huge puzzle in a virtual reality world with the whole world as the prize, and to crack the code the people and corporations of the future are immersing themselves in the singular creator's passions, which are all completely retro - Dungeons and Dragons, Trash 80 text only games, 80s movies, etc. I liked the CHARACTERS even if they were broadly drawn. I liked the bad guys, they always surprised me with how evil they could get while very much resembling the constantly-excused corporate overlords of today. The near future world of energy crisis and indentured servitude to corporations for unpaid debts was one of my favorite parts of the book. And while you're reading, it'll all fly by and you'll love every word. Until after the book. The biggest problem I have is this massive puzzle, built by a genius, which took five years to get a crack in the armor, then devolved into a fairly 'easy' scavenger hunt. I guessed at the first clue for the first key before the main character did. I like books where I am amazed at how smart the author is and he's always 10 steps ahead of me, but I didn't feel like that with the puzzle aspect of this book. That is a quibble, nitpicking for sure, because the experience of reading was great. 4 stars.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2WPG31TDR63HY"}}, {"Date": "on February 29, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3JHC8O59WDHFZ"}}, {"Date": "on August 22, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.723404255319149, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AZHVJULUHRQK3"}}, {"Date": "on May 13, 2013", "Text": "Being a child of the 80s, weaned on TRS-80s, the HHG to the Galaxy, and Monty Python, I should have liked this book.

First, Wheaton nailed the narration. It helps that the main character seems to match how Wheaton comes across on TWIT. Five stars for the narration!  The book itself is fun and the pace is good.  I read some review that said it was like DaVinci Code with a Cyberpunk theme and I think that is a good description--a fun book but not really great. It's definitely not in the league of Snow Crash or any book by Stephenson, Gibson, etc. Much of the plot movement involves pulling an arbitrary rabbit out of a hat. Wade gets stuck in some way and instead of tying threads together through the story, some random solution is presented. The characters and the world itself are 2D and not described in much detail. For example, the story takes place in a post peak-oil world, but that world is only briefly described.

There's no need to read this or the thousand other adoring reviews to recognize the electricity at the page 6 footnote: \"A freeze-frame of this scene appears nearly identical to a painting by Jeff Easley that appeared on the cover of the Dungeon's Master's Guide...\". If that gave you the same thrill as it gave me then: (a) you are a nerd, and (b) you will love this book. The book's preview is available on the (Paperback) page, and is a very fair representation of what you're getting. The whole book is like that; the upfront nerd delight reminds me of 'Soon I Will be Invincible' page 1, but 'Ready Player One' differs from that book in defiantly embracing the values of an 80s video game: Cline isn't discussing or challenging these conventions; he is celebrating them, and he doesn't stop until the last page. If you are looking for classical literary merit, you've come to the wrong place. Reading it (in one sitting) I was disappointed by the aggressively simple-minded approach to character, plot, theme, etc., but if you love a book then it deserves five stars, and I loved every word. Yes, I would have preferred a more reflective or nuanced take on the material, but the writing keeps you hooked from page to page. Playing a great computer game, you're not asking for depth... you know the game is good when you skip sleep to play it. Judged in those terms, and judged in terms of commitment to its concept this is an A+ success.

The idea of the hunt for the late nerdy eccentric billionaire James Halliday's vast fortune in the form of a video game easter egg hunt across thousands of virtual worlds struck a loud chord with me and I was truly excited for the adventure I was about to embark on. I will sum up the main problem with this book in one word - conflict. There wasn't enough of it. It seemed that every time Wade entered a dangerous situation he would just ace it like it wasn't even a challenge. I get that he is supposed to be good at games because of all the practice he has had, but he really had very little trouble whenever a challenge presented itself. I enjoyed all the nods to old games, books and movies, but it got to the point where they felt like they were being mentioned just for the sake of being mentioned. Like I said, it had a great start out of the gate, but it wasn't able to hold up across the length of the book. Silly plot devices, flat characters, tired stereotypes(don't get me started on the characters from Japan), and heaps and heaps of info dumps to slog through. I finished it to the predictable end, but by then it felt like I was reading the script for a flimsy Saturday morning cartoon episode rather than well-thought out novel and I was glad I to be done with it. The first half of the book is great, truly, I just wish it could have held to that level for its entire length.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1H1DWWEX4B3XC"}}, {"Date": "on October 10, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AM83WJG9BE2EP"}}, {"Date": "on November 4, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3HZRRONH209V4"}}, {"Date": "on October 5, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2R7EN1XCXJMZA"}}, {"Date": "on March 6, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A20QYDE0KSQABV"}}, {"Date": "on September 18, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3RAIR289B2A84"}}, {"Date": "on July 3, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2J0M7PE2JQ86E"}}, {"Date": "on February 9, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1NBVOYAHROKXG"}}, {"Date": "on November 19, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A313KKCL4SNNII"}}, {"Date": "on October 30, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7VN9XJY36BJA"}}, {"Date": "on August 23, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2BE3MTUT0YBF0"}}, {"Date": "on August 19, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35QUZGBWE9G2J"}}, {"Date": "on August 12, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2XEN99LO11RNN"}}, {"Date": "on February 24, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A37APF2XOO3B5Z"}}, {"Date": "on September 22, 2014", "Text": "I don't want to say too much for fear of delving into the plot (besides, I think the other users and the book summary have that covered anyway) this book is a great read.

If you've every played a massively multiplayer online game you will have no problem understanding every aspect of the world, and it should be really easy for you to picture events as they unfold (as a gamer this definitely helped me enjoy the book). Most of the story takes place in an online \"game\" called the OASIS, however Cline ties the virtual world to reality at really crucial moments reminding you that the \"game\" the characters are playing might be more serious than fun. Cline's personality comes through heavily into his writing. Much of the writing is clever, the ideas and fiction are extremely interesting to read about, and its an easy read. Some of Cline's writing style however may allow too much sidebar or too much explanation, which at times detracts from the story.

The book also has some interesting ideas and overall \"puzzle\" for the protagonist to complete.  My main problem with it is that the dialog seems like it was written by a teenager rather than a 40 year old writer.  It's as is if this novel was targeted to the young adult readership except it has way too many cuss words, inappropriate content, and most of the references in the book would be lost on today's teenagers.  So I don't really understand who the audience is for this book.  In the hands of a better writer this would have been a 5 star book.  Unfortunately the author spent very little time making his characters 3 dimensional and the dialogue for the most part is terrible.  But the overall plot and events in the book sort of make up for the lack of characterization and turned it into a fun read for me.

Like a good cup a coffee, this debut novel is a fast paced read that is smooth on the digestion. The plot is easy to follow but not to obvious that I was not saying to myself \"I know where this is going\". There are may places in the book that seem semi-autobiographic. If you are a fan of gaming you will love this book. There is just enough gaming jargon and subculture terminology that non-gamers will not be lost. The 80's nostalgia is pleasant and made me put the book down a couple times and meditate on some of the things I remember of the that time. This tome made me laugh, cry, and reminisce.

I wish I had purchased it the day it had come out, because by now, I could have reread it a few more times. Simply said, the book was fabulous. The idea that society could exist within a virtual reality game doesn't seem so outrageous the way Cline writes it. His reverence for the pop culture from the 1980s is charming and the inclusion of those references didn't seem gratuitous. They added to the storyline and gave the characters more depth.

The story is typical, one I've read a thousand times before - a sort of cyber/techno land take on the hero's journey, but the juxtaposition of the intertwined stories that take place in the Oasis and Reality are what really take it up over the top for me.  The Oasis storyline is great but hampered by being a bit too much, but in the context of the desolated reality Ernest Cline builds in the world outside it makes sense. It gives us satisfaction in every way including the constant ability to over indulge. It's like Chicken soup for the \"generation Digital\" kids soul, a constant mash up of your favorite things brought to life in just enough detail that if, like me you've ever experienced them in reality in the proper context as they were intended, you'll be linked by a fond emotional connection and locked to the pages as you wade your way through chapter after chapter. At a certain point though, you'll become self aware that Cline is playing to this very connection and just when you start thinking \"is this read turning into some sort of digital age circle jerk\" Cline really starts to shine. Come for the world, stay for the characters, stay longer to for the insane ending that while great I have no idea how they would tastefully turn into into a film.

reference that sticks in your pores, gets under your fingernails and dampens your hair. It's a tribute to a decade of excess and overload when everyman technology was on the cusp of finding real traction. These things are where the novel is boldly, reverentially, tediously exceptional. As a teenager in the 80's, I found great joy and remembrance in the mention of John Hughes' films, archaic (now) video games like Tempest and Defender and Space Invaders, and music from Rush and others, and the way that these elements were not only woven into the fabric of the story, but were critical to its progression. The dystopian future created in RPO is intriguing and insightful, if not exactly original, and the fact that it's biggest prize hinges on regressing by several decades is clearly where its strength lies. Wade is a nerd for the ages. His only real life is in his fake online persona residing in The Oasis, future's creative next step from World of Warcraft. The book revolves around Wade and his fellow gunters battling cyber villains in cyber space for a cyber prize that will translate to real money in the real world where neither he, nor his friends, spend any real time. It is here that the novel stumbles for me, and the reason I cannot give it highest marks. Cline's dialogue and passion are absolutely evident when he regales us with his expert knowledge of Pac-Man or obscure movie references, but these same traits are woefully unbalanced when he tries to generate the effect with action sequences and dialogue. A lot of the action happens off-line (no pun I swear) and is retold in a retrospective monologue by Wade. It works within the context of the story, but the residual taste leaves my bibliographic meter a little flat. The weakest part of the book is the direct interaction between characters. Often the exchanges are stunted and generate no real emotional connection to the reader. When I finished the book, I couldn't figure out if this was by design. I don't think it was, but if so, Cline is more brilliant that I gave him credit for. After all, in a world where people spend more time being cyber renditions of themselves, maybe direct exchanges between actual other humans would be clunky and unfulfilling. Ultimately, this book is salvaged and elevated by its exceptionally well-researched and communicated nostalgia. It was good enough to bring this well above the average.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3BXZ6YA1RG3SK"}}, {"Date": "on October

It has a powerful sci-fi element that can give a reader a submersion into the world it created. It actually seems to have a double reality escape effect: It\u2019s easy to forget real life around you as you read as well as the world in the story outside OASIS. It also has so many allusions to 80s pop culture that the lines between the world in Ready Player One and the world around the reader could seem to be blurred together, not the mention the fangasams to be had when a reader comes across something they love being mentioned, which may include, but aren\u2019t limited to, Star Wars, Asteroids, Space Invaders, and Dungeons & Dragons. To make things even better, the technology for the OASIS simulator is completely possible. In the world of gaming, anything is possible, and gaming technology is on its way to meeting up with the technology that was mentioned in the book. To be honest, the OASIS system might even make a gamer reader thing a bit about the Oculus Rift, which is an already existing virtual reality system. Personally, I\u2019m a bit of a gamer myself and actually first heard about this book while waiting for a panel to start at a convention, so I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. While it was long and seemed a bit intimidating, it lessened as I grew deeper within the story and grew attached the main character, which is saying something since I\u2019m usually very picky and get bored with books almost instantaneously. While this book might not be for everyone, it\u2019s a perfect for 80\u2019s culture buffs, gamers, and just about any geek.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35LF2SVXRRZV0"}}, {"Date": "on February 13, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2SNBD5EA1BQAP"}}, {"Date": "on April 11, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AB17Y03366TV4"}}, {"Date": "on January 2, 2013", "Text": "It reads like it was written by a twelve year old.

The book has several things going for it -- first and foremost, a unique and engaging spin on the threadworn dystopia genre. If nothing else, Cline is a genius for combining his love for eighties arcade and geek/pop culture with yet another post-apocalyptic tale. On top of that, he knows how to tell a story -- the pacing moves quickly, and I stayed up late several nights to read \"just one more chapter\". And I'll admit it -- I enjoyed all the references to the eighties -- Zork, Rush, Family Ties, and the Atari 2600, among many, many others. Cline not only loves that decade, but his knowledge of arcade and pop culture from that time (I almost said \"era\"!) is deep and wide. The book is a trivia-lovers' dream-come-true: arcane tidbits are sprinkled throughout the story. However: like another reviewer, I'm a bit surprised at all the five-star reviews. While fun, there are definite shortcomings. As many others have pointed out, there's a lot of explaining in the story -- telling, rather than showing, in other words. Once or twice, I wouldn't mind, but it happens a LOT. My other major complaint is with the characters, who unfortunately fall into the most predictable stereotypes. So it's a mixed bag. But it's a FUN mixed bag, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who has even a passing interest in a fresh take on the dystopia genre.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2YIUO6WEQQ0BZ"}}, {"Date": "on November 9, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1A7U9G3728LOU"}}, {"Date": "on May 9, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35CU3GDGENUM"}}, {"Date": "on August 31, 2011", "Text": "This was a real page turner!

Let me start by saying I don't know how I missed this book in 2011. Being a Sci Fi author myself(check out Destiny Earth by Tony Mazzarella on Amazon), I was doing a signing at a bookstore and their Sci Fi club was doing Ready PlayerOne that week.  I decided it would be fun to sit in after my signing and participate which led me to read this. Oh My God!! I really enjoyed all of the 80's pop culture that was so important to me growing up.  Cline hit on everything from TRS80 and TI99/4A computers to WarGames, my all time favorite movie, to Ultra Man and Back to the Future!  He creatively and cleverly wove an amazing, unique story with all of those elements.  He even threw in so many classic arcade games into the plot I was drooling. So much so I pulled up my arcade emulator and played Tempest for several hours(not to give anything away).  And one of my favorite bands as well, Rush! Being an 80s freak and having built a classic arcade cabinet to relive that time period, this book was so perfect for me in so many ways.  Definitely one of my all time favorites, love it so much I bought it on Kindle and paperback!  I have enormous respect for his writing and ability to bring the characters to life.

I was a kid in the 80's - raised on Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Back to the Future and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I found Ready Player One after hearing that Wil Wheaton had voiced the audio book, and while I wasn't sure about the book itself, I downloaded a copy from Audible thinking it would be entertaining to listen to Wheaton's narration while sitting at my desk at work. Needless to say, I was wonderfully surprised by this novel... the characters were well built, the story engrossing, and the 80's pop culture references gave me flash backs to my childhood as well as a few new movies to add to my Netflix queue. Wheaton's voice was expressive, changing with each character, portraying surprise, anger, sadness... whichever the story called for... making the \"movie\" in my head that much more realistic. I found it nearly impossible to tear myself away, listening not just at the office, but also in the car on my ride home and even when I could sneak in some free time in the evenings. I didn't notice any long, drawn out, unnecessary explanations, the writer hooked me right away and the pace never slowed until the final sentence was delivered.

It is also a great book for teenagers because they can all identify with the futuristic concepts in the book unless they have been living off-planet. Virtual School, anyone?

He didn't just make 80's references; he went back to the 60's and 70's and forward to recent years with his mention of video game consoles, authors, and TV series. But every reference made an abrupt halt after the XBOX. I couldn't help but wonder why the author didn't put forth the effort to invent the future of pop-culture, since it was such an integral part of the storytelling - it was as though nobody had released a new movie, video game, or book since 2010, even though the story takes place in the 2040's. That was a huge oversight that detracted from the immersive nature of the story. He does do quite a bit of explaining (ie., telling), but a lot of it was interesting, so I didn't mind.

The writing style is a big gallumphing bore. It is Overly-repetitive, full of cliche as much as it is full of the 80s referential stuff. The other sour point for me, was that for a piece of work with a decidedly athiest  bent, there were quite a few instances of deus ex machina. I wonder if Wade learned that in his latin class?  I don't mean this review to be all negative, there were points when i was genuinely excited, the final battle being one that comes to mind.

Every time that I had to stop and you know eat and sleep all I could think about was when I would get to listen to it some more. I am seriously considering listening to the entire book all over again it was great. The book is about a very poor boy who spends a lot of his time in the virtual word called \"The Oasis\". It is a virtual realty that the entire planet logs into for multiple hours a day. They put on boots, gloves, body suits and wear visors that allow them to feel like they are in this fantasy world. Well soon into the book one of the creators of the world dies and leaves his fortune up to the first person to solve these riddles and find the hidden \"Easter eggs\" in the virtual world. A lot of the book is about 1980's video games, tv, and trivia. The main character has to fight against other players and corporations all trying to win the fortune (several billions of dollars). Its a great suspense that will have you on the edge of your seat.

The novel is set in the future in Ohio, in a semi-post-apocalyptic world and nothing really new or interesting jumped out at me. The detailed explanations about how MMORPGS worked (currently) was unnecessary, anyone who made it to that point in the book is probably familiar enough with it. I understand he was trying to include a broad audience though, so maybe some explanation is required, but it certainly left fewer things up to the imagination.

However, imagining the things being described could be hard due to the fact that most of the things are from the pure imagination of Cline.
