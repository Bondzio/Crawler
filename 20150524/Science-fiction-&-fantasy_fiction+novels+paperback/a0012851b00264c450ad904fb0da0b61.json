That said I gave it 5 stars because of the characters. I found myself engrossed in their personal struggles. Very rarely does this type of story elicit an emotional attachment to the characters, but this one did for me. The fact that the author isn't aversive to killing one off, lends a tension to the story that is needed. I found myself caring what happens to them, most books of this genre overwhelm with action or bore you with hammering home obvious political points to tedium. The action in this story is paced perfectly IMO. This book is about the people not the story. That our current civilization hangs by a tenuous thread is obvious and the many books now in print that chronicle its unraveling all really follow a rather similar course, so while he certainly breaks no new ground in the genre(other than its activating event) the author has created a rich cast of characters that intrigue and entertain. In many ways the story reminds me of Kings, \"The Stand\" which appealed to me for the same reasons this one does. I eagerly await the much needed sequel. It is a fact of modern life that authors seem compelled to write trilogies( or more) instead of just writing the damn story in one book. This story is obviously not over, I wish the author had written it in one setting, I for one would have gladly paid extra not to have to read it to its conclusion in pieces,but such is life in the world of Kindle fiction", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2L5LIFRJSJF8D"}}, {"Date": "on March 3, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ATNSPWS5YVKTM"}}, {"Date": "on December 19, 2014", "Text": "Well thought out timeline.
