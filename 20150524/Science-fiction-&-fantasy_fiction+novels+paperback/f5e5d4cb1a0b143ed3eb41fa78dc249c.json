Hardly anyone ever has a reasonable, thought-out motive for whatever they do - they just do it & what happens, happens.  In The End I thought that it would probably get better, at least we would learn more about the characters & their reasons for being \"weird.\"  Well, it didn't happen!  The women are given a bit more accountability but they are turning out just as ridiculous as the men.  The men are all psychotic.  The women were not worth much in The End, & in this book they are becoming as strange as the men.  Gordon is totally to blame for Hunter.  I realize that such a situation would rattle a person & it would be hard to know what to do.  But please - not this bad!!  Making Hunter (8 years old) feel like both Samantha & Haley are his responsibility is just ridiculous - no 8 year old should have that put on him.
