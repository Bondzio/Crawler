I have recommended the Outlander series to many, many people.  I couldn't wait (and wait we all did) for Written in My Own Hearts' Blood.  I didn't like it.  I feel like it was so disconnected.  I didn't find myself caring about anything that was going on.  There are too many characters, too many story lines, not enough Jamie and Claire.  If I wanted a detailed description (and be detailed I mean droning on and on and on) of the Battle of Monmouth, I would pick up a history book.  This book barely wrapped up the lose ends from the last book and just made a million more.  We are introduced to a bunch of new story lines being started and then *poof* nothing.  The story threads just get dropped with no conclusion, no explanation, no satisfaction.  Why introduce these characters and scenarios and then have them go nowhere?  With 800 pages one would think something could get wrapped up.  I couldn't be more disappointed.  I waited 4 years for this book and I think Ms. Gabaldon threw some disjointed thoughts together to meet a publishing date she moved about 3 times.  I hope she gets her act together for the next book and starts wrapping up these story lines, stop introducing new characters and get back to what made the series so great to begin with: Jamie and Claire.  I know the tv series is taking up a lot of the author's time but I hope she can concentrate and get out a new book in a timely fashion to redeem herself on this one.  How about a lot less time looking up historical facts and more time weaving a beautiful story like we all signed up for when we paid $12.00 for this Kindle book?  It pains me to write a bad review for this.

After reading the first several chapters it became obvious for me this book was to be a disappointment. Diana Gabaldon is a wonderful writer who usually keeps her audiences spellbound. With all the other books in the series, I couldn't put the books down from beginning to end. I found myself constantly wondering throughout the reading of MOBY \"what happened?\".  There were way to many story lines going on at once in the book. While I understand adding new characters to keep it interesting, my real love lies with Jamie and Claire and couldn't help feeling like there were so many stories devoted to these new characters that Diana didn't spend enough on who truly matters in this series. Roger spends page after page going off to look for his father and when he finally finds him he spends all of five minutes (summed up in a couple of pages) with him and never even tells him who he is! What was the point of all those wasted pages of writing? I kept thinking wow, that could have been more Jamie and Claire time! The really disappointing part of that story was that I could not find any reason what so ever that story was even included in this book. He (the father) has no bearing on any other story line in the book what so ever. Lord John also has a story line with his family going on in this book. While I normally love him included in the series due to his past with Jamie, I felt like the whole brother/nephew thing going on here should have been in the books in the Lord John series. It just was wasted here. In the other books I also loved the details and depth of description of Claire's surgeries and battle descriptions. This book however went way overboard. It becomes apparent that in this book, unlike the others, these have just become words to fill pages. jI can't help but to wonder whether the story line well is going a bit dry for Jamie and Claire in Diana's mind. I still will be faithful to the series and I will read the next book but I truly hope Diana slows down some of the other novellas, books, publicity trips, and gets the movie thing up and going so that she can spend more dedicated time to what she does best. Jamie and Claire. Moby just gives you the feeling that Diana's busy life has put Jamie and Claire on the backburner.

The first four novels were so compelling: falling through stones into the past; marrying then falling in love, writing lines like \"... do ye ever get over the wanting...?\" (Jamie to Claire, wedding night); rich characters like the McKenzie brothers who shared a wife; the gasp I made when Gellis revealed her vaccination scar; Brother Anselm and the Adoration ...I could go on. At the end of \"Echo\" where Claire \"sleeps\" with Lord John, it was very hard for me to understand  and now in MOBY, harder to deal with when Lord John states to Jamie (spoiler)...\"we were both 'effing' you...\"...really?

Yes, it's nice to enter the comfortable Outlander world again, but when I start skimming several chapters trying to find an ounce of story movement, I know this isn't quality writing.  I beg DG to end this series. It has run it's course and the never ending list of new characters introduced is watering down our Claire and Jamie story. The characters flit through time, meeting family members as if it's a natural occurrence.  Maybe Bree, Roger and the kids could get their own Tardis and join Dr. WHO on adventures?  Jaime is like the Travelocity gnome-look here I am with General Washington, here's me with Benedict Arnold-these are gimmicks that don't help with the storyline.  The book isn't bad and many parts are enjoyable, but get it at the library- don't waste your money.", "Helpfulness": 0.9, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1EI06F13OA66W"}}, {"Date": "on July 12, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9333333333333333, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AONIW07GVSQPQ"}}, {"Date": "on July 4, 2014", "Text": "I am one of those who will read whatever Ms. Gabaldon writes because she is an excellent author.  Like millions, I am a huge fan of the entire Outlander genre.  But, this installment, having waited so very long for it, left me flat.  I don't mind all the detail of parts of her stories; she has taught me a great deal from her researched stories.  But, like many have noted, the second half of the book feels rushed with large holes in the telling and that's a major problem.  I would have liked to have been there for the settling of Marsali and Fergus in Charleston and wonder why there instead of a large city closer to the Ridge.  I would have liked to have been there for the trek out of Savannah homeward to the Ridge.  I would have liked to have been there for the conversations between Bree and Roger and the planning for how to successfully jump the family 40 years forward in time to get them back to the Ridge with Jamie and Claire.  I would have liked to have heard more about Bree and the children meeting Brian.  I would have liked to know what happened with Buck.  I would like to have walked away with William as he disappears on his own and heard him begin to rethink his paternity.  I have no trouble with meeting so many new characters; if you enjoy Jamie and Claire's world, you should want to meet the people with whom they interact...but there are just too many holes in the story when it comes to the central characters we have come to love.  There's no question, that in her next book (because by now we know there must be a next novel,) Ms. Gabaldon will most likely weave some of these holes together; answer questions; continue the life threads of those we have so learned to love, but it will take years for that.  And, it's the time it takes to create her next book that is becoming frustrating to the reader, especially when she leaves so many holes in the story we have currently to consider.

I have to say if you were like me and you didn't care for Book 7, then you're not going to like book 8. It's very obvious that DB had other things on her mind when she was writing the last 2 books. MOBY was disjointed, the character building was poor at best, and perspectives of many new characters were incorporated, which I didn't care for at all. I love hearing about Roger and Bree and the kids, and of course Jamie and Claire but there was much time spent on Lord John's point of view, while I enjoy his wit if I wanted to hear it I'd read the Lord john books. There was also a lot of focus on the descriptions of battles, which seems more of a way to fill in the pages, rather than advance the story. While the descriptions were wonderful in the first 6 books they always focused on things from one of the main characters perspectives and added to the character building. In this case the battle descriptions serve more to show off the research that has gone into the book.  Several of the plots were unfinished as well, and not on a cliff hanger kind of way. I often found myself flipping back to see if I missed something when the characters were talking because the dialog was so disjointed I had no idea what they were talking about. DB has also incorporated a new Gallic saying 'A Dhia' which I don't remember hearing in any of the other books and was said repeatedly in this book, for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, unlike an Echo in Bone in which I still wanted to read more (even though I didn't care for it), MOBY left me with no desire to read another one. That being said I probably will just to see where the characters go, thankfully I won't be holding my breath waiting for it to come out.

This eighth volume whips the reader along the terrifying road of revolution and war in America, while keeping a watchful eye on the never dull Brianna and Roger situation in modern day Lallybroch.  Diana Gabaldon's narrative and those funny, out-of-the-side-of-her-mouth modern sayings she is fond of putting into Claire's irreverent mouth, are a little more hip and common in this book, which I liked. I could've done without Natty Bumpo.  It's one thing to write your own historical fiction, but to use another writer's characters from another historical fiction, well, it just seems a bit too much.  it doesn't make any difference in the long run. Diana Gabaldon is a stupendous storyteller who has lost not one nano ounce of her power in this eighth volume.  I was so happy and relieved when I read the way she closed this book.  If, when, she decides to end this tremendous odyssey of Jamie and Claire, it will be with my own heart's blood.  She has given historical fiction one hell of a whopping gift and it seems the film of these stories will be a similar success. An ironic aspect of Gabaldon's writing is that so many people who would otherwise have absolutely adored this Scottish / American historical tale, older readers from a history loving generation, wont read it because of the graphic sex, common throughout all the stories. It isn't just a shame for prudish readers, it's a shame that the overall impact of these great books are actually mathematically limited because this puts such a huge generation of people off.

The storyline is filled with twists so improbable as to be worthy of Dickens or Shakespeare, but, as with those other authors, the improbability is an irrelevance.  What matters are the characters -- finely, beautifully and lovingly drawn.  Young Ian, gifted with knowledge of who and what he is, strong enough to get through the clash of cultures that has defined his life; Rachel and Denny, the devout, outcast Quakers, the Aristocratic, impetuous and honorable Greys, William and Brianna, young adults learning to adjust to rude truths about their parentage, and plenty more besides.  But above all, it is the love story of Jamie and Claire that fires all the books and keeps us coming back.  I actually enjoy these later books even more than I enjoyed Outlander, largely because Claire and Jamie are now my age -- and they act like it in every way.  But neither their strength and maturity, nor the infirmities that come with a few extra decades, have diminished their devotion and commitment to each other, nor has it turned them into unsexed lumps.  Most romance in fiction stays rigidly focused on young love; it is refreshing to find an author who appreciates that romance, and sex, is not just for those with perfect, youthful bodies.  She makes the characters solid and believable in circumstances that involve the wildly improbable.  And not just believable.  They aren't just people who seem real, they are people we could actually like and care about.  And that makes each of her books satisfying and enjoyable.  Well,that and the fact that she has a real genius when it comes to writing dialog -- the author she reminds me most of in that respect is the late Patrick O'Brien, and that is high praise indeed.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ARLQ6C07LPINY"}}, {"Date": "on September 11, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AIGIQOEVITSJ4"}}, {"Date": "on September 9, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A366XAN4US5BMD"}}, {"Date": "on September 3, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A11J29XDGEDY15"}}, {"Date": "on August 12, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ALYI8YM90TPD1"}}, {"Date": "on July 16, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A20SPRM1FPYR5G"}}, {"Date": "on July 15, 2014", "Text": "A few years ago, I read all of Diana Gabaldon's books, eagerly awaited new ones, reread most, and recommended them to everyone.

I was even anxious to read this one, after five years of waiting for it, and in spite of my absolute anger with the closing of the prior book.  That one left almost every one of her lovable characters in some sort of cliff hanging horror, and we all knew that it took her four or five years to complete the next one...partly because she is always writing smaller books involving these characters in the intervening years.  I weaned myself away from her forum and the intervening books, the small excerpts she releases in order to hold interest, and so on.  But when this book was finally released, I bought it and read it immediately.  It is a good book, definitely worth reading, but for whatever reason, I did not think much of it equal to her earlier writing.  Long stretches of it are pure history with little actually happening to her characters.  Some of the conversation is a good as before, but much is not.  I was bothered by the constant switching between stories of the different characters, and sometimes was not quite sure who was speaking. It seems most improbable that these Scottish highlanders would have had intimate contact and friendship with every important person involved in the Revolutionary War.

This book definitely captures the history and events of the time (mostly in the 1700's), and indirectly or directly involves many well-known and historical heroes (e.g.,George Washington). The story seems to heavily focus on the history, which, indeed, has importance, but, unfortunately, therefore, seems to stray away from the intended storyline; so much so, that at times, I felt like I was reading a history book, rather than historical fiction with great characters. The author's shift and transition from historical information, to the characters, and then back again, was often not a smooth one, and was perplexing, to me, the reader. And, the introduction of several new characters, including some detailed information on the Quakers of that time, continued to dilute and minimize the other characters. As it is, the reader has a job recalling the many characters from her previous books, and how they relate to the current story, so the addition of so many new characters, becomes a task for the reader. Also, I found some outlandish and sensational story lines within the book which, I felt, took away from the story, instead of enhancing it.  For instance, the storyline involving Brianna, her son and daughter, in the 20th century, was so far-fetched that I almost put the book down, but on the other hand, Brianna's husband Roger, who had passed through the stones into the 1700's, seemed more \"true\" to the author's original style of writing.  Although I will always be a devoted fan of Diana Galbaldon, and I most definitely have loved her past books, I feel that she has strayed from her original successful style and therefore, this, for me, has changed my overall interest, and excitement for future books.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2JF4FJFKX52OV"}}, {"Date": "on July 3, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2388PRX2ZV241"}}, {"Date": "on September 4, 2014", "Text": "Confusing early in the story.

Like many readers, I've been hooked on the Outlander series, thoroughly immersed in the 18th century and caught up in the joys and tribulations of Jamie and Claire, their extended family and friends. This installment had its moments and I thank Ms. Galbadon for keeping us posted.  But... this book suffers from the same shortcomings that cropped up in all of the later books of the series, perhaps even more so - a serious lack of editing; too many contrived coincidences that stretch credulity and sexual violence used as a tension builder to move the story along(to the point it leaves you desensitized and bored with it). It also gets bogged down in excessive detail on Claire's practice of medicine.  The Brianna and Roger story was a yawner and didn't do anything for the rest of the book, so much so I skimmed through their chapters, not bothering with pages at a time. Who cares whether Roger and Brianna get to meet their ancestors? Brianna has been a two dimensional character throughout and that's a shame. I liked the development of Ian and John Grey. Would have liked to see and hear more from Jenny and see William grow out of his funk over his identity. Speaking of which, are he and all other Frasers completely immune to any molding from the people who raised them? There's no balance between nature and nurture which would have made William's inner struggle more realistic.  With that said, do I care enough to buy the next book and find out how mortality catches up to either Jamie and Claire? Probably not.

The story line was choppy, failing to complete the adventures of one set of characters without inserting only marginally related activities of another set of characters, before completing the original story line.  In past volumes of the series references to incidents or minor characters that reappear in another volume included sufficient background to jog the reader's memory. This happened rarely in \"Written...Blood.\"  When a recollection appeared there was scarcely enough information to be of much help. The usual cliffhanger that keeps readers anxious for the next volume was not sufficiently or realistically concluded this time. Just when I thought it would finally happen, the book ended with excited characters running through the fields.  I was left wondering if that was all there was.  Then I realized that there wasn't enough of an ending to make me eager for another lengthy volume.  I have enjoyed the novellas that have been produced between the major novels. Unlike some reviewers, I saw these as similar to TV series spinoffs. There are characters worth knowing but not by taking away from Jamie and Claire as feature players. We can enjoy them in smaller settings. Perhaps therein lies the problem with \"Written...\" Did Diana get too used to the novellas that this major work ended up like a collection of unrelated novellas whose chapters were shuffled together via poor editing?  Only Diana and her team can answer that. Will I read other works that she produces?  Yes, but I won't spend time searching the internet to see when the next publication date is scheduled or look forward to an opportunity to preorder.

In this, book eight of the Outlander series, she picks up where she left off in book seven, with hero's Jamie Fraser's arrival back from the dead, and all it's import to the main characters of the piece, especially Lord John Grey, who has married Jamie's \"widow\"  Claire to keep her from being arrested as a traitor. We rejoin General Washington's troops, fresh from Valley Forge, at the Battle of Monmouth, with Claire in the midst of the battlefield surgery along with her friends, Dr. Denny Hunter and his sister Rachel.  Ian MacKenzie, Jamie and Claire's nephew, discovers his mother has not died in the shipwreck with his Uncle Jamie, and continues to court Rachel, while scouting for the Continental Army with his beloved dog, Rollo.

As new books for the series come in more new characters are added in with their own twist and turn stories. And I believe this trend will continue with future additions. So, if you like intriguing soap operas (not unlike those lengthy Latin telenovelas, albeit of different period, of course), and rape scenes after rape scenes then you will continue to be thrilled by whatever number of books more Ms. Gabaldon is planning to write for the series. Go on, wait 5 years for each and have fun in joining Ms Gabaldon in her violent sexual fantasy.

I enjoy reading Diana Gabaldon's books, and like all of them, this one is well-written and full of romance and drama. But as a series installment it left me longing for much more in the way of storyline development. Like many others, I have long waited and looked forward to reading the next installment of the saga of Jamie and Claire, et al. But, like the last book, almost nothing actually happened to move things along. Clearly, Ms.Gabaldon has done her homework on the American Revolutionary war, and on medical procedures and their performance under primitive conditions but with the aid of Claire's 20th-century medical knowledge, but I'm much more interested in seeing where this story is actually headed--if indeed it is headed anywhere! What does the future hold for our characters? Will they live out their days in the 18th century? Will they come back through the stones one last time bringing Jamie with them? I'd really like to see how Jamie reacts to 20th century life. We've been given hints that he can envision it. So, could he handle it? Would he enjoy it? marvel at it? or long for his own time? This series of books is beginning to remind me uncomfortably of the 6 years I devoted to the Lost TV show which had many interesting story lines that ended up going no where and which didn't so much conclude as finally just stop, leaving so many questions unanswered. I do hope Gabaldon has an endgame--a conclusion to this story. Yes, we readers can make up our own ending(s), but I hope that's not the plan. I want to know how our author sees things working out.

The author  and her publishers strive for accuracy and achieve it. I found one typo, which is miraculous these days. But the family or clan tartan was a 19th-century invention, attributable in large part to the imagination of Sir Walter Scott, the enterprise of weavers who knew  good idea when they saw it, and a queen who fell in love with Scotland. I am mystified as to why Gabaldon would perpetuate the myth, which was debunked long ago. (\"Scotland and Her Tartans: The Romantic Heritage of the Scottish Clans and Families, by Alexander Fulton, 1991, is a great read.)
