Is there nothing this guy writes that isn't awesome?  This is the 3rd book in the Fenris series and it rocks just as hard as the 1st two!  The Kresh are finding out that some humans just can't be tamed.  The Cyborg War hasn't eradicated all the cyborgs, and if that isn't bad enough, there are the insect alien race of the Chirrs to contend with.  Now comes another psionic alien to throw a monkey wrench into the works (or does it just add more excitement?  Depends on what you're idea of excitement is).  For Cyrus Gant, this is the kind of excitement he definitely could do without.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3JH1L2JTX27EX"}}, {"Date": "on May 23, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1QNOK9JQ8H7HW"}}, {"Date": "on May 4, 2015", "Text": "The book starts by throwing you a curve;i did not see coming the death of an important character..the pace if really fast, the action is superb and we get to see old enemies coming into play as well as new allies.. the book ends in a way that you just want to read the next installment..highly recommended..", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1BKZ0VBIM0USM"}}, {"Date": "on May 7, 2015", "Text": "A good book!
