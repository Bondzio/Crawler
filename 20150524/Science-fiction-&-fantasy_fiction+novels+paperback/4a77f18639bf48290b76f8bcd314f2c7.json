The setting is Britain near the end of the 20th century (as seen from a grim, antidemocratic present when Margaret Thatcher was in power), a future in which a limited nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the Soviets has made much of the planet uninhabitable and a fascist takeover of Orwellian proportions has rid the UK of \"undesirables.\" One man, a survivor of medical experimentation in a concentration camp, is getting even with those who shot him full of drugs and hormones. This revenge-seeker, known only as \"V,\" is not a superhero but he's a lot more on top of things than his enemies. Sixteen-year-old Evey, who botches her first desperate attempt at prostitution, becomes a fixture in V's life, and finally his heir. The plot, though, is complex and subtle, much more dependent on the text than the art, with deeply developed characters and a good deal to say about the nature of freedom and making an excellent case for anarchy (which is not the same as chaos).

He is haunted by a torturous past that is believable and wrenching. Because of this, his motivations can be understood if not necessarily justified. Evie is a bumbling, compliant milquetoast when we first see her. The transformation of her mind into a resilient free thinker yields fruit to V's labor. The dystopian, police-controlled state of future England is murky and drab, gray and hopeless. V is the star directing wayward souls to true north.

I agree with what Moor himself says in the introduction that the writing in the early parts is not as good as the later parts (starting from the beginning of Part II, I really couldn't put it down), but it is absolutely worth sticking with. The other comment I have would be that although it is often regarded as a piece of dystopian literature, and it is in part, it is not a purely pessimistic work; there is a beautiful theme of rebirth and optimism throughout the book (as often represented by V, but not exclusively by him/her).

We are invited to accept hero V's political philosophy of anarchism as the best viable answer to the fascist state. Given a choice of fascism or anarchism, I'd probably plump for anarchy too. But... It's a bit harder case to make for anarchy vs liberal democracy, for all the latter's well-documented faults. V tells his opponents you can kill flesh and blood, but you can't kill an idea.

The hard part is doing that and having the story line run smooth.

I think there were even less of V's aphorisms in the book then in the movie, which was upsetting. It seems the only thing the book expounded on was the absolutely laughable and ludicrous politic back-story to the fascist regime (which pretty much ruined the book for me). The movie was bad enough in this regard, but I just had to laugh, the book was so politically kooky. It implies the notion (carried on by the media and liberals) that Hitler was a man on the religious right, and if we allow conservative Christians to have their way, Fascism is the the natural end. This is SO incredible stupid, I don't know where to start. OK first oft, real conservatives are only an inch away from being libertarians, which lines them up with V, not the fascist! They want small government, believing its a necessary evil, incompetent and prone to corruption and abuse of power. While the political left throughout history seems to believe the opposite; that the government is the answer to the worlds problem, that more power in the hands of the progressive elite will solve the worlds woes. Do liberals so easily forget the name of Hitler's party? It was the National Socialist, not the National Libertarians. Do they realize how similar National Socialism is to Communism? Evidently NOT, they are practically twins; twisted sisters; but fascism has a Nationalist bent and the pretense of private property, that is completely controlled by the government. It is a movement of the left, not the right. Many of the communist party in Germany gladly joined Hitler. Oh and Hitler absolutely HATED Christianity, but knew he had to use it for a time until he could completely remove it. And by the way, why did the liberals hate Bush so much, he was practically a liberal himself, pushing bigger government and spending, and starting wars, something in our history Democrats keep doing (Wilson, FDR, Truman, JFK, Obama etc...). Also, just read the news, Obama is more of the same, carrying on Bushes policies that he once ran against, and on top of this making sure 1,000s of people are regularly murdered by drones, resulting slaughter of woman and children who are near where the missiles come down. O.K Sorry this book is not about Obama. But yeah, it was evidently made by liberal conspiracy nuts, Michael Moore types. Conveying the message we must stand against the political right and Christianity, or see Fascism and religious oppression come again and the torture of gays and forced bible study. I say all this, but then again I love the book, the parts that a good are good to the extreme that the political ideas are imbecilic. If you read John Locke's \"Second Treatise of Government\", Locke makes a case that in such a situation where there is a tyrannical government, one is merely a slave, and since the state has no regard for your life and has become your enemy, you are in the state of war. (that's a bad summery, but yeah) in light of this, I could see the justification for V's doings. One thing I hope the book is not conveying, is since this futuristic totalitarian dictatorship was the result of Bush's war on terror, The Christian right and global warming, that somehow the book is making the case that Islamic terrorist are justified and good. Also, all the folks today wearing V mask is bothersome to me, because, no matter how bad things are getting now, we are not yet living under a totalitarian government. Also, from talking to folks today protesting, wearing the V mask, all they can do is bitch about big business, etc... they want revolution, but don't have a clue on how to make sure a revolution is like the American revolution and not the French Revolution. Sure in this book V collapsed the government, but without the right libertarian principles of government (those of many of America's founding), V only brought on tyranny down, providing no principles for a new one to areas that protects life, liberty and property.

Still, the shaggy genius of comics inserts enough of his own luminous ideas; smooth, cinematic narration and amazing action scenes to make V for Vendetta an intriguing read.

And what about V? Moore and Lloyd's mysterious, theatrical masked anarchist quotes everyone from Shakespeare to the Velvet Underground as he charismatically dashes through the Orwellian world, fooling enemies and dazzling readers.

This one really blew me of my socks.  What we get to see is an alternative timeline in which Germany actually won World War II and where England has turned into a fascist state.  People live very cautious and affraid because everything they say or do is being monitored, and they've been overly restricted by their own government. Then oneday a mystic figure appears and he rocks the city. He murders people of importance, he blows up government buildings, and nobody knows a single thing of who he is or why he does the things he does, except that he's codenamed himself V.  Meanwhile V takes a little girl under his wing who he teaches things about his history, about herself and about what is happening. But over time the government is getting closer too.  Along the story more and more is explained about who V is, about what moves V, about the real consequences the war has cost and about the value of a free will. All this is illustrated very appropriatly by David Lloyd in a bit of a cinematic style. This makes the flow of the story even better. For me personally this is the best Alan Moore Graphic Novel I've read so far and I would easily recommend it to everyone who is looking for something more than superheroes.

The elusive protagonist, a mask-clad vigilante who goes by the initial \"V\", sets himself as an adversary to the repressive regime of \"Norsefire\", the Fascist organisation that assumed power. The plot abounds in a number of exciting episodes, in which the hero outwits and overpowers his enemies using an array of lethal gadgets and skills in the deadliest martial arts. The story is redeemed by its sense of irony and sarcasm, especially during the soliloquies of the masked avenger, (the parallel with Batman cannot be ignored) in which he denounces the ruling elite with anarchistic phrases and anti-Establishment maledictions, as in the scene in which he scandalously addresses the blinfolded statue of Justice, prior to annihilating it with a bomb disguised as a rose. The \"piece du resistance\", however, is his poisoning a corrupt priest with a communion wafer spiked with cyanide... Lashings of humour, of so dark a hue are seldom found. The cinematic conception of the plot, (with \"intercutting\" between different scenes) the beautiful illustration and the psychological realism in the characterisation attest to the high gifts of Lloyd and Moore in the genre of the graphic novel and I look forward to their other works.", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A33FA68V0NCM5E"}}, {"Date": "on February 17, 2015", "Text": "Item as described, fast shipping.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A32RD6L701BIGP"}}, {"Date": "on July 31, 2014", "Text": "SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE!", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2EYXK1MCDDIJP"}}, {"Date": "on January 4, 2007", "Text": "Not bad.

It is mildly disturbing, many of the scenes are very in-your-face and theoretically provocative. The basic premise brings you into the underground resistance, lead by the character \"V,\" against a totalitarian empire that had taken over England following a devestating catastrophe. In the movie, it was disease and threat of war; in the comic, I was less certain of exactly what had brought about the rise of the iron-handed state.
