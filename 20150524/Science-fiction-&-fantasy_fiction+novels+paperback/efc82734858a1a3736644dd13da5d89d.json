I felt there were a lot of minuses, only a few worth mentioning (others fall into the nitpicky category, but exist nonetheless): Behavior of and human interaction with the Folk was not the way I would imagine it; the dialogue style used by the authors for scenes with humans and aliens was weak, even terrible at times; and, one of the stronger subplots through most of the book involved Cliff and his cat-and-mouse game eluding the Folk, which suddenly and unceremoniously fizzled out at the end....that part was a real let-down for me. Finally, I was hoping for (and pretty much expecting) the story to peak with a big showdown between the Folk and Sunseeker/Redwing, which did not happen. The whole reason for Sunseeker to fly into the jet and wreak havoc was to send a message to the Folk, which I assumed was set-up for a stand-off, which would have been great drama and fun to read...but alas, the authors introduced a new alien species at the end that diffused the situation, which I felt deprived the reader from experiencing a good ol' fashioned humans-outmaneuver-powerful aliens ending.

A totally fascinating concept (an artificial \"planet\" the size of our solar system, driven through space by a \"captive\" star), the story (spanning both books) is well written, as always with Niven and his collaborations with other authors. Character development is \"thick enough\" for good science fiction, though a little \"thin\" if this were a more \"conventional\" genre of writing. The people are a huge part of the story, but there is also considerable impact on the story by the science (and technology) involved in describing the environment and how events do (or could) impact that environment.
