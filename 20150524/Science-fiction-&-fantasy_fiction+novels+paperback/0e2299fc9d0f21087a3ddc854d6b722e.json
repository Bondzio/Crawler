For the most part, the vast majority of the reviews were pretty favorable. After having read the book, I had to go back through the reviews more carefully to see if I was really alone in my dislike for the book. Without going into a literary critique, let me just say it's unbelievable to the point of ridiculous, it's not a romance -- no obvious love here -- it's more like vivid descriptions of mostly animal-like sex, and I didn't like any of the main characters. The author did seem to know her stuff historically, so it wasn't all bad. But when the Loch Ness Monster paid Claire a visit (and I just knew he would), I just had to say, like John Stossel, \"Give me a break.\" I've read worse books. It was written well. But it's mediocre at best and definitely doesn't live up to the \"it kept me up all night\" hype. Buy it used or get the paperback if you must read it. Better yet, go to the library. In all honesty, I don't read a lot of romances because most are filled with vivid descriptions of sexual acts that I find to be unnecessary, believing that some things are just better left to the imagination. SO maybe it's not fair of me to write this review. But I do read a lot of different stuff and this was definitely NOT one of my favorite books. I'd only recommend you read it if you are really desperate (like at the beach with nothing better to do and no other book in sight).", "Helpfulness": 0.863013698630137, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on December 10, 2004", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8397435897435898, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1EPNJ5ZFCJNUQ"}}, {"Date": "on July 4, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.88, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A14A73WABX95S5"}}, {"Date": "on January 18, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2GTW7ARPLP6YR"}}, {"Date": "on December 15, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8775510204081632, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A33I60JYZ8M5SA"}}, {"Date": "on October 6, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8285714285714286, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1ND868ZPPPXBQ"}}, {"Date": "on February 19, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8324022346368715, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3NA0Q74SAP3Y9"}}, {"Date": "on July 27, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8387096774193549, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2PO3A8MSLTJGI"}}, {"Date": "on November 7, 2000", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8533333333333334, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A31BYZWBLKDP24"}}, {"Date": "on March 11, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8183279742765274, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AMLESMF01J2J1"}}, {"Date": "on December 31, 2001", "Text": "Diana Gabaldon is an outstanding story teller.

Then all it had was sex, rape, & Claire acting completely stupid. Following Jamie's beating of Claire to \"an inch of her life,\"  independent and strong-willed Claire went so far as to justify Jamie's beating of her. Completely out of character! Jamie raped Claire, I think, just days after he beat her; she said to stop because he was hurting her, but Jamie kept going so Claire would call him master. Absolutely sadistic and misogynistic! Gabaldon threw away all the hard work she had done making Claire a strong and resilient female protagonist to nothing more than a stupid, passive, adulterous, sleazy, and pathetic excuse of a woman. I am convinced that Claire is obsessed with Jamie; she will let him do anything to her. I bet if Gabaldon had Jamie kill Claire \"accidentally\" and find a way to bring her back to life, Gabaldon would still have Claire's character love him and stay with him. This story has become ridiculous, even laughable. Claire's reaction to Jamie beating her was so unrealistic; it was like they argued over something as trivial as Jamie forgetting to buy a birthday or anniversary gift for her or Jamie ruining her favorite dress. It was so insulting to have women portrayed in this way... As nothing more than a female dog to be used as a Scottish man's little sex-slave pet.

To paraphrase an old TV commercial, \"I bet you can't read just one.\"  These books are nearly impossible to find in used bookstores because people  hang on to them to read again and again.

From the moment the hero is introduced, we're given repeated graphic descriptions of his old injuries (deep scars on his back from floggings, scar from head wound, etc.) and his latest ones (body covered with whipping marks, marks from being burned with a hot poker, right hand broken/crushed/nailed to a table, physical/emotional injury from rape by sadistic British officer).  In case that's not enough, there's also child abuse--an infant \"changeling\" is left out in the woods to die, and a young boy is taken on by the hero as a stable lad to escape the regular beatings by his father.

An historical romance novel and time travel?  After reading Harlequins as a teenager, I avoid romance novels like the plague.  As a general rule, I find history rather dry and boring and never read any novel set in a time before 1970 either.  Fortunately, a friend talked me into making an exception for this one.  She warned me that it might take four or fives chapters before I could get interested in this book, which begins in Scotland in the 1940's and it did.  If she hadn't, I likely would have tossed it after the first chapter as something unreadable.  But then, I was hooked.  It made me laugh, tear up, hold my breath, gasp, gag, sigh, sit on the edge of my seat and neglect my mundane responsibilities for three days.  I couldn't put it down.  This book has it all.  You'll devour it but you'll hope it never ends.  The main character, Claire, grabs your hand as she travels back in time to the mid 1700's and never lets go.  I have to admit the language was a hurdle at first and I had to shorten Jamie's nickname for Claire because of the way it sounded in my mind, but it enhances the story rather than interfering with it.  I don't know if the story is historically accurate and I don't know if their conversations are realistic but I lost myself in the story and the characters and I believed it.  It made me think about what people felt and thought and how they lived 250 years ago and realize that, modern conveniences notwithstanding, love, hate, betrayal, tough decisions, happiness, a sense of humor, sympathy, anger and sadness dwell within us all no matter when we were born or where we live.  Now, I am somewhat frugal (ok, cheap) and normally borrow books rather than buy them.  The day I finished Outlander, I made a special trip to the bookstore and bought the rest of the books in this series.

The thing that struck me the most besides the passionate passages of love and devotion is the subtle humor and play-by-play between Jamie and his sassenach Claire. The back cover of the book in which it leads you to believe Claire commits some sacred act against her marriage to Frank is absurd, she would have commited a sin against love if she did not go with Jamie. This book was so vivid, and real that I believe many husbands have been compared more than once to James Fraser. Claire's voice shines through the pages and Gabaldons obvious knowledge of  Scotland in the 18th century and human mentality is divine.

Fooled, I held on for quite a few hundreds of pages, hoping that \"Outlander\" was not just some sneaky excuse for a female submission fantasy.  But as another reviewer has noted, that hope gets dashed mid-way through this door-stop of a book, when the heroine, Claire, gets a proper beating from her husband. I mean, if I found myself in a prior century getting whipped by my new husband, however understandable that action may be by his lights, I'd nonetheless double-down on my plans to get back to my own time.  But not Claire.  After \"punishment\" is \"administered\", Claire is invited by her brawny Highlander to just leave him and go. If she leaves, she can get back to that little time vortex and back to her own time.  Or, she could hang around in the 18th century and get a really great rogering! Guess which cruel fate she picks?  It will go on for pages.  On the bright side, you'll snort and guffaw and start talking with a brogue while Gabaldon burnishes to a bright glow every cliche you remember from what bodice-rippers you may have read.

This I mostly skimmed because what was the point of telling a story about two people in the present when everyone was busy living in the past. And what a past it was, perhaps for those interested in historical violence and gore, this is ok, but after the first couple such trips into the past I was bored. The second reason is because although Claire was portrayed as a strong woman who took everything in stride, except for when she went bonkers and started scolding anyone and everyone, I saw her as a rather wooden and difficult character against which the others characterizations were made to look richer and shiny. Jamie for example, was well portrayed, but then he was beaten, then beaten, then really beaten again, but that was him and his life. His sudden and fateful love  for Claire were not convincing at all, because she was never particularly nice, nor witty, nor personable. All she was, was Sassenach. Regarding her side of the story, because her feelings were rarely mentioned, if at all, it just looked like she was the sounding-board, medicine woman who randomly wandered into the story.

Then someone gave me a copy so I reluctantly cracked it open.  It stayed open pretty much for the next forty-eight hours as I read it cover to cover.  It's really not a romance novel at all;  it is more of a historical adventure story that happens to involve a bit of time travel.  And yes, there IS a love story, but it involves a tall, redheaded, kilt-wearing, claymore-wielding, blood-splattered Scottish Catholic virgin who is prone to terrible seasickness and frequently tries to wipe out his competition's distant ancestors, and an older, more experienced woman with impulse control issues and an understandable lack of patience with 18th century social mores.  Anyway, my advice is to ignore the \"romance\" classification and give Outlander a try...then once you are sucked in, read \"Dragonfly in Amber\" which is the second in the series and even better than the original...then \"Voyager\" and so on and so on until your eyes fall out after the sixth hefty volume.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ASK8TUK09BK46"}}, {"Date": "on March 12, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on September 25, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8461538461538461, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2B4T2N7K6KVWJ"}}, {"Date": "on April 27, 2001", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AKCLWA9FN83L"}}, {"Date": "on December 27, 2014", "Text": "I enjoyed the characters, the setting, and the plot, but had to stop reading and delete the book entirely.

I watched the TV series and purchased the Kindle edition of the book series so I could get a feel for the author's writing and note the things not covered on Starz. At first blush, it was an interesting story. We have had many time travel stories over the years and this one differed in that it was about a British woman - having served as a WWII nurse - who accidentally time traveled back to 1743 Scotland. I was curious to see how it would unfold. I have no problems with Gabaldon's writing style - though her descriptions and details are sometimes so long as to become tedious at times. I was disgusted by the multiple rapes, beatings, and sex scenes - every 2-3 pages held something explicitly sexual or brutal in nature. Jamie's character underwent such horrendous brutality and torture, painstakingly detailed by the author, that it made me sick to my stomach. Gabaldon threw everything lewd, cruel, sadistic, twisted, and barbaric she could think of into this series. The books are very long with too much detail. Some of the descriptions are clearly not historically accurate. The characters could have been better developed. The TV series may be better than the book - which appears to be the case with Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. I was terribly disappointed. Gabaldon decided to take her characters around the globe. They endure wars, plagues, disease, gang rapes, Voo-Doo, Indian uprisings, and of course, the American Revolution.

In all fairness, I'm not a fan of romance novels and their formulaic plots and sexual stereotypes, which probably explains much of it. The author apparently tried to \"break the mold\" by making the heroine older than the hero, making him the virgin, making him the object of unwanted rapist attention (along with her), but nevertheless this book included the worst of the romance genre. Particularly annoying were the heroine's constant witty internal comments and repartee at the most inappropriate moments (example: heroine is supposedly in serious danger of being burned at the stake for witchcraft by an angry mob and she's thinking snide comments and dubbing the religious judges \"Mutt and Jeff\" in her mind. Really?! This is how you'd be thinking?? I doubt it.). I cringed through the \"necessary\" beating/spanking (bruising her so badly she can't sit comfortably for days) for which our heroine forgives the hero after he shares his childhood humiliations with her (children and adult women being obviously requiring the same discipline techniques, I guess). I also loathe depicting nasty couple fights and name-calling as some sort of sexy foreplay. Editing might have helped as the book drags way too long with superfluous scenes that had little to do with the plot (e.g., details of the sister-in-law's labor and delivery; rescuing/hiring a mistreated boy from his alcoholic father, etc., etc.). After an interminable amount of this drivel, the final portion of the book involves a horribly sadistic homosexual rape and torture scene and the gruesome aftermath that is gone over (and over) in revolting detail.

At that point, I start to think to myself that I could read TWO books in the time it would take me to finish this one. But Outlander is one of those books that you really can't call yourself a romance lover unless you've tackled, so I decided to go there over the holiday weekend. And it was a pleasant endeavor. The thing I liked most about Outlander is that I didn't feel that a word in the 850 pages was wasted. It's one thing to read a book that's 600 pages, that would have been better if it had been 400, but Gabaldon seemed to realize the importance of making things count. The relationship between Claire and Jamie is meticulously detailed, the settings are outlined so richly that you can see in your head what's happening, and the emotion is captivated with a voice that I won't forget. This book is a romance staple for a reason--it makes you love the hero and heroine. I fell in love with Jamie a thousand times over the course of this novel, and while Claire made me angry at times, I liked her for loving him, accepting him, and taking care of him. There were so many sigh-worthy moments and times when I had to stop reading just to let a particular piece of the story sink in that reading this book was like drinking a fine wine--I savored it, taking my time, and only continuing when I was ready. That being said, I probably won't read the next books in the series. Outlander was, at times, heart-wrenching, and that's usually not my thing. Seeing a strong man broken is not something that I enjoy, even if he's put back together again, and I don't know that I can do it again.

The author is very detailed and descriptive - which is wonderful for the parts of the story that are essential to moving the story line forward. However, as many other reviewers have stated, this book could have been half the length and would have been much more enjoyable if it had been edited. The author goes off on way too many tangents that are simply needed - boring even. I found myself asking \"what is the point here\"? Although some reviewers have taken great exception to Jamie beating Claire, I wasn't as bothered by that scene because of the time period and the fact that Claire had, in fact, risked the lives of the entire group that was traveling with her and protecting her. I also struggled at times even liking Claire. She came across as selfish, obstinate and sometimes downright childish. But even all of this I would have forgiven, because the fact was I kept turning the pages - until the last quarter of the book. What happens in the last quarter of the book is so disturbing and vile and completely over the top that the author just lost me. I was so angry and disturbed that I put the book down.

A very pleasant, very addicting drug.  Gabaldon's writing is always elegant, never fussy, and moves along at a quick pace.  After about 50 pages of this novel, I was absolutely hooked for the entire book, and that's saying a lot considering it's over 800 pages long (depending on which format you read).", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2KIVODZRTGY4U"}}, {"Date": "on October 1, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2I0PW0QL0HKKL"}}, {"Date": "on October 10, 2014", "Text": "Don't be sucked in by the gorgeous production values, breath taking locations and brilliant casting of the television series.

Weird. She seems very content with the filthy 18th century and rarely even bathes, herself. She seems enamored with a stinky Scot. Does she like filthy-smelling people? Why not try to introduce some modest improvements in personal hygiene? As for the stinky Scot, he's just not my kind of guy. The number of times and ways he gets himself beaten up is impossible. The only way he could survive all that is in a kid's video game, but somehow Gabaldon always resurrects him from near death. And, sure, all 1940s nurses knew how to set fingerbones, right? Easy peasy. I enjoy steamy sex scenes, but the ones in this book were lurid without being particularly exciting for me. For example, I didn't particularly enjoy or appreciate the intimate descriptions of pregnancy by Jamie's sister. And was there a point in the long description? I didn't quite see the relationship to the plot. I read through to the end because the concept of having a modern person travel back to another time period was intriguing, and I wanted to see what would happen next. But so LITTLE actually happened in this book (other than a sort of episodic traipsing through 18h century Scotland) that I won't be reading any of the other books in the series. It was OK. But I was tired of it before it was over. And when Claire got pregnant at the end, I just rolled my eyes.

It's almost as if each book is written from a different perspective, thus adding to the intrigue of the story.  Also, no \"insignificant, minute\" detail can be ignored because it surprizingly show up and connect to a very significant event later in that book or a following book and completely blow you away at the cleverness of this writer.

Her historical research was excellent and her ability to create fictional characters to meld with historical figures of the time was outstanding.  My family and I lived in Northern England for three years--making several trips to Scotland.  Scotland is an amazing place, but Ms. Gabaldon's story and the historical accuracy she maintained during the telling of her story made it that much more awe-inspiring.

I read the book only becasue I watched the premiere of the cable show Outlander on Starz. The book at times is very boring and to descriptive. I like stories that set the scenes in a book, but this author goes way to far in her descriptions. She describes everything in detail. It caused me to loose the point at times. Outlander seems to have a lot of little stories that don't really connect with the main storyline. Like the Witch Trail. It did nothing for the story. As we all know Claire has been sent back in time to the Scottish Highlands where she meets and married Jamie Fraser. I understand her shock of finding herself in 1743 Scotland. However for a well traveled married women of 27 and a nurse in WWII she act very immature though out most of the story and gets herself and Jamie  and the Clans in lots of trouble. I loved Jamie from the beginning he was younger then Claire but he was what is referred to as a Alpha Male Warrior. He was so brave and so strong. What I didn't like was the author breaking his personality down by having him captured yet again by Black Jack Randall and sent to Wentworth Prison to be hanged . Jamie was tortured and raped by the sadistic Robert Randall, Claire's 6 times grandfather in law from her 19th century husband Frank Randall. Robert Randall and Frank Randall look exactly alike. Black Jack Randall as he is called is a sadist homosexual. Whose whole purpose in the story is to get to Jamie and rape and torture him. Jamie is captured several times in the story. This became quit disturbing to me. So much torture.  After Jamie has suffering so much over the past 4 years at the hands of Black Jack Randall and surviving he finally breaks in the final scene while in Wentworth Prison. Poor Jamie was sodomized whipped so many time the skin was removed from his back, Branded with Randal initials made to have oral sick with him, craw an beg for more. This is Sick!!  I don't like reading about rape weather it is a women or a man. I find authors that do this might have a fetish to be raped themselves.  The horrendous torture and beatings that Jamie withstood every time Black Jack Randall captured him should have been enough for any Sadistic storyline. I have bk2 Iwill try to read becasue I paid for it and I hate not to finish something. I want know how Jamie get on!! I am not sure at this point if I will read bk3 or the rest of the series.

I read it and throughly  enjoyed it. The prose is lush, the characters are excellent and I love Claire's sense of self and strength. It's a good solid  read. It is however very violent in spots. BE WARNED: there is a very  contriversal scene in which Jamie, angered at the fact that Claire has  disobeyed him and in doing so threatened the llives of his clan, beats  her  violently.  She fights him back and it escelates into an all out brawl  between the two. Several interviews with Diana Gabaldon find her explaining  that scene, saying that it served to illustrate the character and time  differences between the two.  I can see her point (the idea that women  were not property in 18th century Scotland was radical at best) and can see  where Jamie and Claire would find themselves at an impasse. However, I  wondered if it wouldn't send a subtle message  to women that abuse is  \"romantic\" when seen in this lavish contest. Beating is still  beating if it happens in 18th century or in the 20th. Claire does tell him  that it's not like that in the 20th century and if he ever beats her again  she's \"disembowel him with his sword\". THAT I liked. True to  their understanding, he never does again.  After reading that scene I was  amazed at the fact that I repected Gabaldon as a writer because she deals  with an abusive situation, works through it and expells it. How many other  \"romance\" novels are there where the woman is abducted, raped and  abused by the man and then \"surrenders her heart\" or some other  nonsense? In those books, a romanticized abuse IS the plotline.  In this  scene, Gabaldon bravely and disturbingly presents a conceivable situation  between a man raised in the 18th century and a modern, liberated woman.  If you can swallow that scene, it IS an excellent story with some  wonderfully realistic and romantic scenes.

I also remember thinking that maybe the compelling aspects of the story weren't worth struggling through the deeply unpleasant parts. Rereading now with a friend from work, I find Gabaldon's first novel too long, overstuffed, and more than a little disturbing in its fetishization of rape. The strength of it lies in her penchant for characterization--Claire, Jamie, the brothers Mackenzie, Jack Randall, and the rest of the cast of thousands come alive in a way that makes it nearly impossible to put the book down. Perhaps this is why the sadism of the Randall plot line and the disturbingly blurred boundaries throughout--between love, aggression, desire, consent, and increasingly brutal violence--left such a scar on my first reading, 20 years ago: the book is, on more than one occasion, painful to read, but the characters are so compelling that they stick with you, and you want to know what's in store for them. If it had been a movie, I'd have watched it through my fingers, staring only at a corner of the screen until I was reasonably certain there would be no more terrible images of brutal violation and pain. As it stands, even reading quickly (unlike the author, I had no desire to linger on the lovingly sketched portrait of Jaimie's torture) can't completely obscure the poison that runs through a story that is otherwise enticing, if sorely in need of a editor. The growing love between Claire and Jamie is gripping, as are the adventures, the list of which is surely too long. But it's the sadism--the extent to which author, antagonist, and hero alike revel in breaking human beings both literally and figuratively--that held the tightest grasp on my memory.

I always asked her whether she was reading a good book, to which she almost always replied, \"it's alright . . . but it's pretty much like all the others.\"  I always wondered why she bothered . . . after all it seemed like a horrible waste of time.  When I was older, however, I found that what she said was basically true . . . romance novels are pretty much just the same book but with different covers and characters with different names.  But, after reading Ms. Gabaldon's work, I believe that a new trend in romantic literature has arisen.  The only book that I like better in this genre is \"Gone with the Wind\" for one simple reason . . . with Scarlett I knew what motivated her while with Claire I wasn't quite sure what she was about.  Since, for the most part, she wasn't very interesting, I never really cared about her (I didn't want her to die, I just wanted her to be more exciting and three dimensional).  On the other hand, I really liked how the character of Jamie was set up for development.  As a reader, I saw constant and detailed instances of how and why he was the man he was in the story e.g. very specific and detailed flash-backs in his life.  I also say \"Bravo\" to a wonderfully complex villian in Randall. He was not merely a storybook cliche. I was left wondering how he grew into the cruel man he became and what exactly was his relationship with his brother Alex?  I also loved to hate Dougal -- he was a hoot! I didn't know if I wanted to have him slapped, shot, kissed or spanked, but I do know that I would have volunteered for any of the four.  I really enjoyed Geillis too.

Four hours into it, I was getting very confused. Claire was a grandmother. Her daughter who was conceived in the 18th century had lived with her husband in the 20th century. Could a 60-hour long listen be part of a series? I wondered. I stopped the book in its fourth hour and discovered that I was listening to book 6!

While the heroine's character is mostly likeable I can't get over the fact that she completely gives up on her 1st loving husband (Frank) for this young Scottish hero (Jamie). I have read other books in the series as well and in one of them she is forced to return to her modern life to save her unborn child by Jamie. Frank takes her back, baby and all, but her reaction to Frank's attention (indifferent and arrogant enough to say \"I loved you ONCE\" and \"You may divorce me\") and her decision on their state of marriage are annoying and frustrating. Who could blame Frank when he is driven to have affairs. This goes on even though Frank stays with her for the next 20 yrs and she believing that Jamie is dead. This makes her character questionable, to me. I can understand all the rave reviews. I would've given 5 stars too if I'm only focussing on Jamie/Claire love story and their incredible adventures, but it also matters to me how they deal with other people around them. In this case I consider Claire as being very selfish and unfair towards Frank. I can't like her. It would've been much better if she is back to being a wonderful wife to Frank as she was before, after all she believes Jamie is dead and Frank loves and dotes on her daughter and they remain married for another 20 yrs.

As other reviewers  have noted, one must start the series with this one. Not only does it  outline the beginnings of their adventures together but it also shows how  the character of the author herself changes throughout. The book starts in  a typical English fashion where, during World War II, Claire is a nurse in  England being from a conservative English family with English mannerisms  and sense of etiquette. This is wonderfully portrayed throughout the first  novel but undergoes a wonderful change as you progress into the second and  third of the series, Claire rises from the almost staid woman of the first  novel to a woman not afraid of her passions. One can feel the effect Jamie  has on her, perhaps a sign of Gabaldon's own life changes. This is also  remarkable considering the fact that Gabaldon is herself American and yet  is able to show a certain \"Englishness\" which is very authentic,  not to mention her character portrayal of the Scots involved such as Jamie  or his Uncle. The aspect of magic and sorcery present in the time travel  and other fascinating incidences are presented more as natural forces  rather than any fantastical experiences you would expect from typical  fantasy novels, I think this also is something to be praised.

It was a pleasant way to pass the time and I was interested in finding out what happened in the end--but I wasn't totally consumed by it. The concept of the book is interesting enough: A woman from the 1940s gets transported back in time after stumbling through a cleft in a mini Scottish version of Stone Henge. Unfortunately, there were some parts that I just couldn't come to terms with. First, after Claire gets transported back in time, she just kind of rolls with it! There are a few times that she freaks out about it, but for the most part she takes it all in stride and is extremely calm about the whole thing. Honestly, she seems a bit one-dimensional. The fact that the book is written in the first person requires that the author be adept at expressing the characters inner thoughts and feelings. Gabaldon just didn't deliver on that. Perhaps she would have been better served writing in the third person. And, as if the magical time traveling stones aren't enough, the Loch Ness Monster also makes a cameo. Really? Finally, while there was a lot of detail in the book, I felt as though some of it was gratuitous and didn't add anything to the overall plot. Despite those misgivings, it was still enjoyable to read.

And though there are over 500 reviews for this  book already posted, I just had to add my thoughts.  A good friend  recommended _Outlander_ to me well over a year ago and I was surprised and  dismayed that the book was nowhere to be found in my town.  I finally  hunted down a hardcover copy at the local library -- this thoroughly  surprised me because our library is sadly lacking in any sort of modern  books!.  I immediately checked it out and devoured it in roughly two days  -- stopping reading only to eat occasionally and sleeping even less.  I was  hooked -- here was a book which incorporated all the things I enjoy in a  romance novel:  time-travel, Scotland (I'm a sucker for a Scottish burr and  a kilt!), a heroine who is brave, strong and intelligent and a hero that  melts the heart and boggles the mind.  Promptly when I finished the book  the first time I turned right around and read it again -- it was *that*  good!  In _Outlander_ Ms. Gabaldon has set forth an epic story full of  love, honor, passion and steeped in history.  Yes, the reader is given a  good dose of history but is certainly not bored to tears -- Ms. Gabaldon  brings the action and the scenery to life and quickly you go from reading  about history to experiencing it almost firsthand.  I could almost smell  the heather of the Scottish Highlands as I read and each page I turned  pulled me more into the story.  Not only is the plot intriguing and the  history exhilarating, the characters are so well drawn that each person you  meet along the way seems as real as if they were standing right beside you.  I really related to Claire and though I was skeptical at first reading a  first person novel, I was quickly snared and started feeling part of the  story.  In Claire Randall Fraser, Diana Gabaldon has created the epitome of  a romantic heroine.  Faced with innumerable obstacles, Claire realizes that  a love worth having is worth risking anything for.  She faces the world  head on, courageously meeting each impasse and standing by her man no  matter what.  In James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser, Ms. Gabaldon  created a romantic hero that is impossible not to fall in love with.  Any  man when faced with certain tragedies can be brave, but Jamie Fraser *is*  brave -- it's part of his core being and it fairly seeps from his pores.  His is an honorable, loving and giving person who takes what is handed to  him and through tragedy grows and becomes a better person.  No man should  have to face what Jamie faces in this book and as you read of his trials  and suffering at the hands of Black Jack Randall you will weep with him and  for him.  Perhaps it's crazy to say that you could fall in love with a  fictional hero -- but if ever there was a fictional hero worthy of love it  is Jamie Fraser.  I often become so immersed in a story that I have trouble  putting it down and continuing on with my day-to-day existence but with  _Outlander_ I put the world on hold and relished each and every word.  You'll have a difficult time pulling yourself away from this book until  you've successfully turned the last page -- and then you'll have trouble  deciding what to do first:  read it again or search frantically for the  other three novels in the series.  If you read no other book in your life,  read _Outlander_.  It is a story that can capture the heart and the  imagination.  And in the end you're left with but a question:  How far  *would* you go for the one you loved?", "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2L2I8TQRBP9Y2"}}, {"Date": "on September 11, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2BDXWCF5B70LL"}}, {"Date": "on February 1, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2V7ORCBIAFAA0"}}, {"Date": "on August 26, 1998", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3B0LBOISZM8RE"}}, {"Date": "on April 29, 2003", "Text": "Friends of mine kept telling me about these awesome books by Diana Gabaldon, but I could never find them in the store.

You fall in love with Jamie Fraser and you love Frank Randall along with her and you decide with her what to do about all the hard decisions she has to make this this life that she was thrown into unexpectadly. By the end you have been on this amazing emotional roller coaster and what was a 800 odd page book that looked daunting when you bought it now seems like a part of your life and you are just waiting to start the next chapter of it. This series is amazing and I recommend these books to everyone I come acrossed.

I have to admit, I was slightly embarrassed to find it listed in the romance section, but was determined to read it anyway. I'm really glad I did. Barring the necessary sex passages that lovingly describe muscular loins, the book is really more historical than out and out romance. Claire Randall is a former combat nurse at the end of the second world war. Recently reunited with her husband, they are vacationing on the Bristish Isles when she is transported through a circle of stones to war battered Scotland. My one quip with what I otherwise thought was a very enjoyable (if not a bit too long) book, was the premise of her having two husbands in two very different times. Her husband is only in the first fifty pages of a nearly nine hundred page book. So unless he returns in later books, it's really her courtship and relationship with the Scotish warrior Jamie Fraser that the book is about.

Claire lives in post WW2 re establishing her relationship with her husband after a long war separation. They travel to Scotland for an extended holiday and explore a stone circle. Claire returns alone and finds herself plunged 200 years in the past through some power the stones seem to hold. She is picked up by a band of highlanders and as an ex-nurse finds herself having to tend to Jamie, a clansman. Jamie and Claire are characters I really grew to like. They are not sickly sweet and as you can imagine, Claire's modern ways, cursing, feminism and language do not make life easy.

This book really grabbed me and kept my interest throughout and it is a long book.  It was well written and very exciting and I looked forward to reading it at every opportunity.  I love historical fiction and history of Scotland so this book had a lot of appeal to me.  I am not a big fan of time travel stories, but I thought this story handled it pretty well, and did not make it the primary focus of the book.  While I found this book very enjoyable and will probably read more of the series, I do have some criticisms of it.  First, Claire adjusted far too easily to being thrust 200 years in to the past.  She quickly devised her cover story as to who she was and immediately adapted to 18th century life with little complaint about the drastic change in lifestyle.  Since this story was written in the first person, one might expect some commentary on the difficulties she encountered with the lack of creature comforts and hygiene, but she pretty much glossed over those issues, except for a brief mention midway through the book about how her upbringing with exposure to nature and the great outdoors made her new life easier.  Second, I like a good love story, but I do not like romance novels...there is a difference.  Initially, I thought the developing relationship and love between Claire and Jamie was handled nicely, however, as the book progressed, the constant focus on their never ending sexual encounters seemed more like a trashy romance novel.  I think much of that could have been omitted without the book losing a thing, and would have preferred that.  There was a lot in the story that was unbelievable, like rescuing our hero from a prison, but let's face it, those are the things that make stories exciting!  Also, Jamie was probably the most perfect hero who ever graced the pages of a book except for the time he beat his wife.  On the other hand,  I very much enjoyed the religious considerations of time travel issues when Claire asked for guidance from the priest at the sanctuary.  Overall, there is so much that went on in this long book that there is a lot to like but also a lot to criticize.  In the end, I enjoyed reading this book very much, even though there were aspects I did not care for.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A212FQOV7WTJL9"}}, {"Date": "on February 24, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ASS72CE968BRZ"}}, {"Date": "on February 23, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HUWB8NABL01X"}}, {"Date": "on February 19, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2J1BPMYPJD1PF"}}, {"Date": "on February 18, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2LOU2SU62B3HM"}}, {"Date": "on February 13, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AS5FQGYEPHGVO"}}, {"Date": "on February 2, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2E3GFHUDNPYDH"}}, {"Date": "on January 11, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ABN9YHFT9FVTP"}}, {"Date": "on December 23, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A29MDXRYFYPA3Y"}}, {"Date": "on December 23, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1IUEQMZEII96H"}}, {"Date": "on December 9, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2P950QN17XQ7X"}}, {"Date": "on November 18, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A398AAC8R3409C"}}, {"Date": "on November 14, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A21TSBBTF0DMG5"}}, {"Date": "on November 5, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3MU2ZQVBIY7XQ"}}, {"Date": "on October 29, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1L7ZA5T12G6BK"}}, {"Date": "on October 28, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2SFY2J2H6AB1F"}}, {"Date": "on October 24, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3QISEN87WSVWC"}}, {"Date": "on October 23, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2Z3IXZ17E88J4"}}, {"Date": "on October 21, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A33K4X0MQL5NF4"}}, {"Date": "on October 19, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A5MX7XNNAO8QF"}}, {"Date": "on October 15, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1GFCIIW14JKBD"}}, {"Date": "on October 15, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ATHNYP7D3RW1A"}}, {"Date": "on October 4, 2014", "Text": "The problem with most of the one star reviews for this book is that the readers are not considering that this is an \"historical fiction\". Meaning a fictional story set in an historical time. People are crying feminist crap about the domestic abuse, violence, and rape in the book.. Consider that marital rape did not become illegal in all 50 states until 1993. 20 years ago. We are even now seeing cases of spankings being debated as domestic violence versus appropriate punishment (Adrian Peterson). How then are we to gauge the beating of a wife who endangered the lives of many men because she did not obey her husband? I'll admit that the passage made me cringe, but when you read it from the historical perspective, it is accurate. Whether or not she is a modern woman, as some have argued, does not matter, she is not in a modern time. As to the complaints regarding Jamie's fond reminiscence of his father's beatings: I don't think you read the passage. He was not happily remembering the beatings, but his father and the things that he said that impacted the man Jamie became. The life lessons he learned from his father were often given when he had done wrong and had to be whipped. Just as a parent may  punish with time out and then sit down and explain why a behavior was wrong today.. I fondly remember my mother's favorite punishment: hugging my sister until we talked out whatever we had been fighting about. I'm not remembering the punishment fondly as I was often bristling with rage, but rather the result - which made me a better woman. Yes, they have sex a lot, but they also talk about deep topics and meaningful life events. Both contribute to the development of their relationship throughout the book (and come on- sex sells). If you read a historical fiction and expect tidy streets, modern law, and pretty events tied neatly into a bow.. You obviously are  not meant for true historical fiction.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A9G6N265WX9A2"}}, {"Date": "on October 2, 2014", "Text": "Well. I don't normally write book reviews so I am no expert here.  It is only my experience that I relate.  I sort of accidentally came upon this subject due to the Starz  program.  It was a matter of I simply chose to watch the show while channel surfing.  I guess I caught it about mid-showing,  just before the wedding.  So....I liked it right away because I am a history buff (and yes, I enjoy cross checking historical references from books or movies).  For whatever weird reason, I felt a kinship with the story and setting.  I think what really hooked me tho, was the sheer attraction between Jamie (what can I say?) and Claire.  Damn, these two actors really make that passion, the tension of it, so real on screen.  Also...I don't want to forget Dougal, who, in my opinion brings a really strong and passionate character to not only the clan, but to the Claire and Jamie relationship, as well.  I know he gets a bit sleazy further on, but even in the beginning, you can see his passion for Claire.  It just adds to the suspense.  Watching just 5 recorded episodes (I guess i missed recording a few of the first...gotta catch up!) compelled me to buy the kindle edition of the books.  I've finished the first (which had me going back and watching those episodes I'd recorded) and am now on the second (Dragonfly in Amber).  I am still enthralled by the story.  Even though I get a little exasperated at the assumptions and behavior and thought that Claire and Jamie put each other through, I find myself just waiting until they figure out what is really important.  Their love scenes are well....,you just have to read it and make up your own mind as to whether that appeals to you or not.  For me...it was a home run!! Love it.  I plan on reading the whole series :)  I fell like Starz, so far, has done a darn good jon of staying true to the books.

If you are not a historical reader the imagery details may escape you. She had to have researched this book to the ends of the Earth to have gotten all of the minor details right. I know this was written a decade ago but it provides a prime example of the difference between fly-by-night self-publishers and ones backed by publishers. Don't get me wrong I LOVE Indy writers and actually prefer them over publishing houses and their forced drivel! Diana gave me chills at every turn though my least favorite part was the prison scene after she leaves Jamie behind. There was something lacking like she danced around the edges of the topic at hand. However I will say that ten years ago talking about a subject like this was a dicey proposition! We are far more open to the ideas now. Her descriptive style is what makes writers great story tellers. My favorite by far was the explanation of what it felt like to fall through the stone. The sense that you could feel it with Claire was truly incredible! It still gives me chills. I must have reread that passage fifteen times it was so enchanting. The ending was a little lack luster a hint of what was to come probably meant as a cliff hanger. It could have provided drive for the next book. Instead she \"jumped the shark\" in as few as five pages of the next book. It ruined the series for me. I won't say more but I will caution you if you are a Jamie supporter you may end up bitter with the first chapter. So unhappy that I read the spoilers and then promptly returned the book.

The impossible happens when Claire, exploring a small circle of stones in the hills, is suddenly catapulted back in time to 1743. Shortly after her arrival in 18th century Scotland, a skirmish between English and Scottish soldiers sweeps her away from the stones, and into the heart of the Highlands. Although she vows to return to her husband by any means necessary, she soon finds herself drawn to handsome Scotsman Jamie. As it becomes clear that their fates are meant to be intertwined, Claire finds herself torn between one lover in the 18th century, and her husband in the 20th century.<br/><br/>First, I\u2019ll give you the positives about the novel. Although it tops 600 pages, Outlander is a well-researched and lushly detailed page-turner, and the love affair between Claire and Jamie is hot and dirty enough to make any middle-aged romantic squeal with delight. Yet, being the cynical spinster that I am, I found that the warm glow of the romance couldn\u2019t outshine certain glaring problems in the story.<br/><br/>First off, the heroine. Although Claire is supposed to be a Blitz-era Englishwoman, she seems more like a liberated female from 1960s America. Worse than that, though, is the inconsistency of her character, which seems to oscillate from strong, steely combat nurse to immature brat at the drop of a hat. As for the \u201clove story,\u201d there is much to be desired. The only reason the couple gets together is due to a convenient forced marriage that will ensure Claire\u2019s safety from the pursuit of a sadistic English captain. And although she protests her new marriage to Jamie the hot Scot, she is soon struck speechless by just how darn attractive her groom looks in a wedding kilt, and becomes, sort of, well\u2014distracted from thoughts of her modern-day husband. While she does feel bad about betraying Frank, her sense of guilt isn\u2019t visited nearly often enough, which leads me to think that maybe she and Frank shouldn\u2019t have been married in the first place. After all, shouldn\u2019t such a legitimate love affair, especially one that deserves such celebration, be founded on a little more than how high the hero ranks on the Scoville scale?<br/><br/>Needless to say, there will be those that disagree with me. Some readers will love this story, others will hate it. For the majority of readers who found The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife to be a flawless epic of true love, you will probably adore Outlander, and its many 800 page sequels.

Finally a face to sweet Jamie. Ahhh... Hmmm....Sorry I lost my train of thought for a moment. After a bit of a lag getting into it, I was captured by just how intense, crazy and realistic this world is described. Every page I am not just reading words on a page, I am there and I just don't get why I haven't used some of Gelie's magic to transport me there in real life. But that being said, I have a really hard time recommending it and wanting to see the new show. By chance a friend mentioned this the other day, and she too struggled with the brutality and explicit nature of Jamie's rape. It almost borders on some bondage/sexual fantasy that is for an audience of explicit romance novels.  To my point of view, there are more details about the realities of his encounter with Jack Black than with Claire. I really wonder just what Starz will do to this scene. If they go all Hollywood and make it appear that part of Jamie enjoyed it, then it will be very insulting to the real life victims of rape who, I can surely guess, did not enjoy it either.  However, if they do explore the graphic nature of this- I will have to pull my eyes out of my head as I really can't stand watching this kind of stuff. (Yes, I am talking specifically to the crazies who made the Girl and the hornets nest European version- holy crap disturbing). Yet at the end of the day I love these characters. Claire's response and life-saving measures for Jamie is a direct change from the timid girl we meet in the beginning trying to run away.

These books are not for the faint hearted.  It's true I couldn't put these books down but at times I wished I'd never started the series - I guess that's really what makes a book great?  No other book(s) made me feel so emotional.  I'd even think about these character's as if they were real and had to remind myself that it was just a book and I was being silly.  Sounds crazy I know.  The books are very long which for some readers might be hard.  I can be impatient sometimes wanting to know how something ends without having to spend more than a few days reading but these stories don't end anyway!  So if you like to pick up a book and have a happy ending when it's over these aren't the books for you.  Now if you love your books to really tell a story with lots of detail (sometimes too much) and you don't expect happy endings then you should definitely try these books.  You can read them out of sequence but you shouldn't - they do build upon each other.  This first book I really liked but almost put it down to never picked it up again before finishing (something I never do) because I felt like the writer just brutalized Jamie (the best character I've ever come across in the hundreds and hundreds of books I've read). I felt like it was just too much but she did back off a bit on the rest of the books and poor Jamie did get some mercy.  You'll fall in love with Jamie.  You'll want to keep reading these books because you'll want to see that Jamie has a happy ending.  Terrible things happen to the character's in the books so if you're used to books where the character's narrowly escape disaster and nothing really bad happens to them - again these aren't the books for you.  My favorite of the books was the Voyager and I really liked An Echo in the Bone.  The Echo in the Bone book probably got the worst of the reviews although there are usually good reviews for these books but I don't know why - I really did like that one.  Maybe because of the ending.  Gabaldon waited until the end to really amp up the excitement and pull in more interesting plots.  I am worried though that this story still won't end with the next book.  Please end them soon Diana Gabaldon!  I want Jamie to have a happy ending - he certainly deserves it!

process and the content of the book.  It seems Gabaldon used a lot of unnecessary descritptions (i.e., the flaura and fona that goes on for pages in the beginning of Outlander) to take up space as opposed to really good character descriptions/development.  I did find it to be a page turner due to all the action, but, again, too much of this and not enough character description.  I found many of the secondary characters drawn better than Claire.  I do not know if writing it in the third person would have made a difference, but, at times, I wanted to smack Claire and ask Jamie what he was doing with a cold, selfish woman such as her.  I had no understanding of what motivated Claire. For example, she stays with Jamie when he gives her the chance to return to the 20th Century, but, the build up of why she did this was not enough.  I did not see the progression of her falling in love with him and not just seeing him as a friend.  When she joins him in the cottage (a great scene), and he asks her \"why\", Claire still can not open up totally with him.  She always seems to hold back, even just a little.  Gabladon is an intelligent writer and has an excellent way with words; she can say in a sentence what some writers can not say in a paragraph and she conveys her message really well. But, I found myself too frustrated at times with things that happened with the two main characters.  The biggest problem in this area was Jamie's rape.  He allows this to happen to save the life of Claire.  I could deal with this.  But, when Randall crys and Jamie comforts him and when Jamie gets aroused, this opened up a whole can of worms that ruined some of the story for me.  Jamie would not be physically capable of becoming aroused unless he were \"turned on\".  His is beaten, bloodied, and raped and he gets aroused!  This is going to far for the hero, in my opinion.  Especialy when this theme reoccurs in later books with Capt. Gray.  Yet, like so many readers, I found Jamie to be a romantic figure - one of the best in a long while due to the realistic way he is written.  He is not a cooke-cutter hero.  I like Gellis and Jenny better than Claire.  In their few scenes, they were drawn much better than her.  I have no problem with whatever genre this book is in - it was a good read in many ways.  The problem with the series as a whole is that she could have gotten the story out  in less pages if there was less filler descriptions and more character development.  I did not like the fact these people with this supposed great love were kept apart for 20 years.  I know Gabaldon used this as a plot device to bring us to the American Revolution, but, it did not work for me.  If I were Claire, I would have been hitting the history books as soon as I returned to my century to find out what exactly happened to the man I am supposed to love beyond reason.  True, she thought he died at Culloden, but, she was even too selfish to find out how.  When she is with Frank she thinks of Jamie and vice versa.  I would have been back through those stones with baby in tow as soon as our child was born and I knew was healthy.  Gabladon's research is excellent, but, where the books were good, they were great, where they were bad they were lousy.  She started out to do historicals and added romance as an afterthought, so she has six of one and half a dozen of another.  I agree with another reviewer who said she should have stopped after the first 3.  I will say that I do admire her for the risks she took; she did not tie things up in nice, pretty bows with fast resolutions.  She has an excellent imagination and I admire her for using it.  I think the Loch Ness monster scene in Outlander will be one of my favorite scenes of all times", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on February 13, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2I2SZ4V148WQX"}}, {"Date": "on November 24, 2014", "Text": "Kept me turning the page and was interesting to read about the History.

I had heard about this book for years & I was really intrigued with the show. Well let me tell you the show is so much better! Something I never say.  The way I heard women swoon over this book I expected so much more!  I like a good escape in a romance as much as the next gal but this was just plain terrible.  The book is just a plain & awful let down.  Claire acts ridiculous in the book! And Jamie, seriously Ladies that man was written by a woman!  I am all for literary fun but it just gets to the point where you continually say to yourself \"really?\" It is more than that though, I think the best way to describe it is pot holes, a page or 2 seem promising & the writing dumps you through an alley of potholes, literal potholes.  Such a let down!  Big build ups with the scenes you would THINK held importance and you get a crappy one liner\u2026and it continues like that A-L-L the time.  I can't tell you how many times I was like 'that's it!'. She tells Jamie she's from the future, ya that gets like a couple of paragraphs.  And the sex scenes are fairly blah, except for the violent ones, like really?  I am so thankful a friend told me about the vile & horrific rape scene as I quit reading at that point.  They said it disturbed them for days.  I understand that rape would without a doubt always be horrific reading about but from what I understand the depth of detail goes beyond a lot of violence in books. So be forewarned if like me that would haunt your life for weeks.  One reviewer noted that the author must absolutely hate a man named Jamie as she spent pages torturing him in the most grotesque ways!  As one reviewer put it, wish I could time travel back and not read this book!  It kind of ruined the enjoyment of the Starz show, its talented actors and Scotland!  Maybe the TV writers can save what could be a promising story, I wish them luck!

But too many people equate love with romance rather than by  association. There are enough incidents to darken the plot, such as sadism,  rape, and graphic violence. On the other end, the act of intercourse, is  pushed to its highest level by portraying it not only as the simple and  pleasurable joining of two bodies, but two lovers struggling to become one  and indistinguishable by sharing and uniting their souls. The elaborate  plot brings to the forefront, what love means, as it is constantly tested  through different trials.

The first book is where we meet most of the major characters for the first time, including of course Claire, Frank, Jamie, and even young Roger..  I remember the first time I read the book; I started out rooting for Frank as Claire's husband, BUT then the author introduced Jamie.  He has been my favorite male protagonist of all time, and I have fallen in love with several heroes from Harry Potter to Gideon Cross.  (I mean as characters, of course).  And Gabaldon is just such a wonderful writer.  We get to know the characters intimately.  We see and feel the surroundings, the majesty and grandeur of the Scottish Highlands, the miserable degradation of the prisons...we can experience it all through Gabaldon's words.  It always amazes me to think that the author had not visited Scotland when she wrote \"Outlander\" because I have been to Scotland, and her descriptions are spot on.  Obviously, she did her research.  But the story itself is intricately woven, and as I continue to read, I see how wonderfully the events and characters are linked.  Yes, there are things that happen to the characters, as well as characters' actions, that are horrific, but such is true in life as welI.

Cast into a bewildering, primal time when Scotland is torn by war, Claire is compelled to join forces with a young Scotsman named Jamie Fraser when she unintentionally attracts the attention of an infamous British soldier known as Black Jack Randall ---- her husband Frank's ancestor.  Jamie rescues Claire from Randall's attentions by marrying her.  Suddenly, Claire is enmeshed in the intricate politics of Scottish clan life, saddled with a stranger as a husband.  But Jamie is a gallant young warrior whose compassion, tenderness and courage compel Claire to consider whether she will try to return to her own time or stay with the young man who has captured her heart.  Gabaldon has written a magnificent first novel that is chock full of valiant battles, breath-taking escapes and heart-pounding sex.  \"Outlander\" is a terrific achievement, providing non-stop action and likable, believable protagonists.  Although the book is an unabashed romance, Claire is no vapid, young heroine; she is an older, experienced woman who has endured death and violence as a nurse in World War II.  Her medical and herbal knowledge provide entr\u00e9e into the suspicious Scottish society which welcomes a woman who can diagnose smallpox or efficiently return a dislocated shoulder to its proper place.  \"Outander\" is a book to be savored again and again by the discerning historical romance fan.", "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1UPZ6048ZEJ87"}}, {"Date": "on October 16, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A6P2AJXVWXGJQ"}}, {"Date": "on February 17, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1MD9X8QWSCYOS"}}, {"Date": "on July 8, 2003", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A378QUSAFNIND4"}}, {"Date": "on March 14, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1TUBKEWD01LLS"}}, {"Date": "on December 1, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1N54L1XPIV5HF"}}, {"Date": "on December 11, 2001", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2MD5BT7B1EL0I"}}, {"Date": "on May 4, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1K5YQD4O47KM5"}}, {"Date": "on December 12, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1E5ZR1Z4OQJG"}}, {"Date": "on November 26, 2014", "Text": "It's a great book better than the series but the series is good also.

Don't expect sizzling romance, but it is an excellent story.  It is a story about tremendous love and heroics in a dangerous world.  Although there are frequent references to sex, many are described mildly as if in passing for example: he took her to bed.  A few are more detailed and describe the power, or amazingness of the relationship or events around the couple.  On the negative side, I can usually handle limited amounts of torture in stories, but this book had a terrible event which combined torture and sex which I wished I had never read.  I would like to forget those details and so far they're still haunting me.  Another part of the story I did not like was the open ending.  I had no idea if she would become pregnant, or if they would be able to change events in the coming war.  I then read some Amazon reviews of other Gabaldon books and realized there are at least 5 other books in this series which continue the story.  I saw that my questions would be addressed in those books.  I haven't decided whether to read any of them yet.  At the end of this book I felt a little worn out, as if I had been living through the tragedies.  I prefer a happier feeling for myself at the end of a book, but this book left me with more of a feeling of relief that they had survived somehow.  The best parts of this book were the two amazing characters, their love for each other and the various things they did for each other.  I am glad that I read it, but I'm not ready for more.

I admit that shaped my view of the book as I was enchanted by every morsel of the TV series. The book follows the story line closely of a woman thrust back in time in the Scottish highlands and her relationship with Jamie, a young man on the run. Season one of the TV series ends at about the midway point of the book, so reading the rest kept me on the edge of my seat. From what I've read about the times, Gabaldon captures the 18th century authentically. The highlanders were warriors, but she depicts them as normal human beings, with the same issues and concerns of modern times. She makes it credible that someone could adjust to living without modern conveniences - although I wanted to find out how she dealt with toilet issues and her period. While she's wholly in love with Jamie, I like that the story shows Claire's continual struggle over her husband in the 20th century. The story isn't perfect - there were times when I thought the \"steamy\" scenes were getting to be a bit much (okay, we get the point - they're newlyweds!) and some scenes around Jamie's capture and the scheme to bust him out of prison later in the book were far-fetched. Really, she fights off a pack of wolves?! Perhaps the best part is that the story got me to look into my own Scottish heritage and I discovered they were clan chiefs from the highlands and Jacobites, too. Shortly before Culloden, one relative, a clan chief, was hung beause he wouldn't reveal that he had a son. It makes reading this story even richer for me.

So I gave the book to the individual who recommended it.  About 5 years later, a friend gave me a bag of books and OUTLANDER was one of those books.  I thought OH NO!  There's that book again!  I donated the bag of books to a charity.  Last July I wanted to get back into reading historical romances and read a couple of books that were so-so.  I wanted to read something EXCELLENT and long, perhaps a series.  Then I got to thinking about OUTLANDER.  I know the book had excellent reviews on AMAZON so I downloaded the sample onto my KINDLE FIRE.  The sample only has two chapters.  Not enough to know if you'll be able to get into the book.  I was afraid if I purchased the book at $8.99 I wasn't going to be able to get into it like before.  I called AMAZON to see if I could download it for free since I purchased it in 2003 and it's there in my history orders.  AMAZON said NO.  I would have to purchase the book again.  So I did.  Forcing myself that I would get into the book no matter what.  Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ, I would have to get into it after pay $8.99 again.  OMG did I ever get into this book!  I LOVE IT!

I also have to admit that I've been living under a rock for the past 20 years, because despite being an avid reader and having worked in a library I just discovered this wonderful series by Diana Gabaldon. This novel is a great combination of intense drama, angsty romance and comedy. Yes comedy. There are some great (funny) conversations between Claire and Jamie as they both get to know and understand each other, especially later on in their relationship. Claire being a modern woman of the 1940's trying to adjust to Jamie's world of the 1700's is fascinating and the author has done a wonderful job of capturing her mixed emotions. This is especially so, when Claire has to decided whether to return to her time or stay in the past and once having made that decision know what the future has in store for them. The question Claire faces: should she try to change the future or just get out of its way.  The author did a great job of handling the torture Jamie endured at the hands of one particular English captain with such emotion. It was gut wrenching and it tore my heart out as he recounted the experience to Claire. The amount research done is evident in how she describes with detail the life of those living in the Scottish highlands in the 1700's.

Yet again I wasn't disappointed. Jamie is a dream come true. Big,ruggedly handsome,sweet, protective with the sexiest accent I can only imagine. Claire is his match in very way, beautiful,smart,resourceful, stubborn, and dangerously opinionated for the 1740's. I found the book Claire and Jamie more playful,lighter even than the show. They flirt a lot,talk dirty to each other. I just found them more personable,less serious. Things do get dire, but they always have each other, and they always find the humor in everything. Even when the most dreadful things happen to Jamie, and I think he's done for Claire yells at him,pulls him back from the brink with just a touch. I like show Geilis and show Dougal -they bring so much physically to these characters that I don't think it translates in the books very well. There are some slow parts in the books - the ghosts stories( though I know they may have meaning later), the childhood beatings Jamie got- I know they were character builders and so people can see the difference between love and abuse but I just thought it was too much.

I am and will always be a lifelong reader, and I can honestly say that Outlander is the first book I've ever read that so perfectly blends my two favorite genres together.  I've always believed that the best stories, whether in books or movies, do more than entertain... They make you really contemplate and reflect.  Not only has this book set me down a path of finding out more about my own Scottish ancestry, it's made me deeply contemplate the universe and theories we now believe to be impossible, but may very well be the opposite.

Such an incredible, touching, story deserves to be exposed to as many people as possible.  I would also like to congratulate the author on her historical accuracy.

She could also then be a critic of their world as well as her own \"modernized\" one.

An amateur herbalist, Claire goes exploring around a local standing stone circle, and is sucked back in time ~200 years to a Scotland on the brink of rebellion. There she meets Jaime Fraser, the highlander who will become her husband, rescuer, rescuee, sparring partner, and great love. Her knowledge of modern medicine, herbs, and history give her valuable tools of survival, but her modern sensibilities also make it difficult for her to make he way in a culture still steeped in superstition and the more misogynistic side of \"chivalry.\" Jaime becomes the man who is equal to the challenge of a strong-willed, highly intelligent, educated, and medically skilled English woman whose mere presence in per-rebellion Scotland elicits suspicions of spying and witchcraft. This novel, and the rest in the series, are steeped in thoroughly researched historical detail, a slew of engaging characters, and conflict on scales ranging from interpersonal to international. This book is about 4 1/2 stars, rounded up (there are some scenes that are historically accurate, but may jar a modern reader).", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A17EPZ9HZUUJKY"}}, {"Date": "on February 3, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A363QLPPZ1TZGX"}}, {"Date": "on October 21, 2010", "Text": "I was recently weeding out old books, trying to make space in my overflowing bookcases for new purchases. I came across my old copy of OUTLANDER and considered getting rid of it. After all, I didn't care for the later Gabaldon novels and had quit reading the series after a few books. So maybe my fond memories of staying up too late night-after-night reading OUTLANDER years ago were distorted? Or maybe I would no longer like a book I had liked years ago? With these notions in mind, I opened it to read a few pages before discarding it... and found I COULDN'T discard it. Now that I had started it, without having had any intention of reading the whole novel, I couldn't put it down! Exactly as I remembered from years ago, I was once again up too late at night, several nights in a row, unable to stop reading even after I got sleepy and knew I'd regret it in the morning. It's a wonderful, engaging, energetic, compelling, romantic high-adventure tale of love, history, action, intrigue, loyalty, betrayal, and fantasy! The first time I read it, I thought it was a stand-alone novel and had no idea the author intended to write a series. And it still works well as a stand-alone novel. If, like me, you didn't enjoy Gabaldon's later books, it's well worth returning to this early book--you're not remembering wrong, it really IS a terrific read.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7CX6WJCWI40F"}}, {"Date": "on October 7, 2008", "Text": "Outlander is a title that I've had several people tell me I need to read, but I just put it in the back of my mind as a dated historical romance until this tag. I wish that I had read this book when it first came out (granted, I would have been nine years old), because then the novelty of time travel would have been fresh, and I wouldn't have felt the weight of every other romance I've read over the years with that theme that have cribbed from Outlander. Claire is a wonderful, absolutely non-stereotypical, character. Her dilemma of loving and marrying two men in two different times makes her fascinating as well. There was only one time I wanted to smack her: In Wentworth Prison, instead of watching Jamie and the brute fighting each other, she should have had the forthwith to smack Randall and take care of him before he woke up!! That made me want to tear my hair out a bit. The middle did drag a bit, and for awhile it felt like the book would never end. I enjoyed it, but it was loooong! I have already added Dragonfly in Amber, the sequel,  to my wish list. It's got romantic sex without being pornographic. Lots of amazing historical detail. Jamie is awesome! How cool is it that for once the MAN is the virgin! Gabaldon turns so many romance stereotypes on their head. Even in a book that 26 years old, she makes the genre new again.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24H4WUFUDPTAA"}}, {"Date": "on November 26, 2014", "Text": "Well written, it keeps you turning the pages to find out more.

Just for fun I looked through some other reviews, especially the negative reviews because I was curious to see what it was about the book that caused people to give it just one star.  Now, I completely disagree with what the naysayers have posted about the book, but I also respect that every one has opinions and these people are entitled to have their own.  If you are reading the reviews on here, my word of advice is to take them with a grain of salt.  Again, these are people's opinions and things that bother them, may not bother you.  As much as the infamous \"wife beating scene\" bothered me when I read it, I also took into consideration that this was set in the 1700's and things were done a heck of a lot differently back then and frankly much worse things also took place (maybe drawn and quartered rings a bell?).  So, I seriously recommend when you're deciding whether or not to read this book, realize that it takes place during a very dangerous time and is written in very intense details.  Draw your own conclusions about the characters and understand that just because one person thinks it's not a good story doesn't mean you won't enjoy it.  If you do complete this book and do indeed enjoy it as I hope you will, the next books in the series get better and better!

I read it the entire vacation, the way home, at home -and read it four more times that year.  I think this book is one of the best escape books I've read in ages.  I fell head over heels with Claires wit, Jamies earthiness.  Problems?  Well, I got obsessed -watched Braveheart and fell in further -was suddenly looking for a man in a kilt and the misted crags of Scotland.  I was in Ohio at the time. . . Those of you who are critiqueing Gabadalon's style -yes, you have some valid points.  However it sounds as though you are people who don't lose yourself in this kind of book.  Relax and don't take it too seriously (it *is* FICTION btw), find yourself a writer who suits you and don't spoil it for those of us who fell in love with this series.  For some of us, it is a godsend in the area of escape literature and fantasy.  I recommend this book (the rest of the series is steadily altered, so takes a bit of priming of expectations) to anyone needing a good long walk through a the gamut of emotions -this book will take you there.  I think the overall message she is portraying is that life carries the unexpected - laugh at what you can, and understand the rest is a part of your travels.
