The book reads like two tales in one, it begins as an apocalyptic end-of-the-world story that turns suddenly into an alien invasion plot halfway through. I found the two main characters interesting enough that I didn't get that feeling one sometimes gets with divergent plotlines based on multiple characters, where you lose the flow of the story when the perspective switches from one character to another. The buildup to the two main characters meeting was so drawn out that it was a bit of an anticlimax when they finally joined up. I often found myself thinking, \"I wouldn't have done that in that situation,\" which told me I was getting drawn into the plot. Often the characters themselves would later comment on a foolish decision they had made, in a way that made it believable why they had taken that action at the time. I found Walt's nihilism a bit off-putting at first, though ultimately I ended up rooting for him as the author kept throwing disasters in his path. His transformation into an action hero was a bit jarring, but I thought that the author delivered with an ending that resolved the various threads he'd set up. I also liked how the two main characters were set off each other, one seeking oblivion, the other just trying to keep himself and his wife alive.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A10BLMM5EFVH4N"}}, {"Date": "on December 31, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8333333333333334, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3QR2T1HKUCVZH"}}, {"Date": "on August 5, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24YBXREJDUU6Q"}}, {"Date": "on April 14, 2014", "Text": "I found this book enjoyable.

The first part of the book did a great job explaining the spread of the virus/whatever and told a great story from two different parts of the country.  I immediately liked it because one part of the story had a couple choosing to \"survive\" in place, by defending and prepping in a house.

Such artifice drops me out of a story because it is disingenuous to the reader.

The other couple has a guy who... well I don't remember what he did, but after the outbreak he and his partner find a way to farm and take care of themselves. I really enjoyed both storylines. The twists throughout did a great job of sustaining suspense. Robertson's writing is very strong and I loved that he focused so much on the relationships, while also adding in enough description and tone to give us a visceral sense of the world in its post-apocalyptic existence. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say he kept me eagerly consuming the story straight to the end and beyond. That you can get the first three books for $.99 is a steal. The audiobook narration is superb. Ray Chase is one of my new favorites. If there are drawbacks, the finale wasn't a knock it out of the park shot, and certain events left me caring less than I had hoped to be in the end.

There is a lot of back story interspersed throughout. Some of the characters are unlikeable, but I don't have to like a character to find him/her interesting. There was a lot of description, but I enjoyed it. At times the dialogue was a bit Hollywood. I liked the playful banter between Mia and her husband; didn't care so much for the perpetual snarkiness that abounded elsewhere. The book did have a Stephen King feel with its similarity to The Stand in regard to the killer virus, but I thought it was quite a different story than that told by King. I think part of the reason I liked this book so much might be because I liked The Stand so much. I don't know about typos because I listened to most of the book on my Kindle. In listening, it seemed to move smoothly and came across as a well-written book. There definitely were a few spots where I had to back up and listen again to clear up some confusion. And parts of the story strained credibility, but it is fiction, after all. The way that supposedly main characters got killed off reminded me a bit of The Walking Dead. However, even with superficial similarities to other works, I still found the story original enough to be very intriguing. Now, after that assessment of the other reviews, I will say this: I enjoyed this book. I looked forward to going back to it to see what happens next. I felt the author overall had a very professional approach to his craft. I even enjoyed the parts about planting the garden and looking at the breakers.

Robertson starts slow in his novel \"Breakers,\" which chronicles the incubation and fallout of a runaway virus that kills nearly everybody it infects. He spins the tale through two main characters, Walt in New York City and Raymond in Southern California. Both are twenty-somethings who aren't the most successful, intent on plugging away at life despite the seeming urge to surf the couch most of the day. Then change begins. In a way, the arrival of the virus that kills indiscriminately offers both characters a way out of their boring existence. Raymond gets a job mostly because he's \"clean\" helping a shady character, and Walt has to deal with the fact that his jerk girlfriend is dead and he must get on with life. Walt takes a bit of convincing, but his storyline definitely is the more interesting. Raymond acts like an observer who's forced to participate. His wife, Mia, is a bit under-used but is a more dynamic character. And dynamic is what they need. Nobody who sits around moping about the situation does well in this situation. The economy tanks, services shut down and chaos descends. And then the fun begins. Robertson injects first person observation of his choice of locations. I can tell he's lived in New York from the descriptions of sights and smells. Likewise, he's spent some time on the coast in SoCal. But he has a talent for adventure yarns. The pace of this book picks up about a quarter of the way through and doesn't ease up. It's really not an apocalyptic survival tale.

The story begins with a flu-like plague that decimates the earth's population, and this is followed-up with an invasion by aliens who had unleashed the disease in order to destroy our ability to defend ourselves. I liked that the story concentrates on two main characters, one in L.A. and one in New York, although they eventually meet up. It's easier to get to know them, follow their adventures and develop sympathy for their losses than if the book took a wide-ranging view of the invasion. We don't know much about the aliens, which are described as giant crab-like creatures who may or may not be collecting humans to eat them. One of the few weak aspects of the story is that the aliens and their technology is too easy to resist, especially by a handful of survivors that, while smart and resourceful, aren't drawn as scientific or military experts. Despite that, over-all the book is well-written and the story moves forward without dragging through any long, descriptive passages.
