I believe this is the third one in the series and you should definately pick up the others before reading this one or you might be a little confused.  While this one wasn't my favorite in the series, it was still good and nothing that I would chuck into the bin if I had bought the paperback addition.  I will say that the male/female roles were a little reversed and it was a little off putting for me personally.  Arek was a little like your slightly whiney woe is me victorian-ish maiden, and Imhara was the more understanding strong role.  Not to be sexist, but come on... this IS a romance novel haha.  I would still recommend this book to others though.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AJ17P2351TGMP"}}, {"Date": "on April 20, 2013", "Text": "This is another installment in the Light Blade series and I loved it this one is sensual and amazing as Arek and Imhara learn to trust themselves and come to terms with their revenge.
