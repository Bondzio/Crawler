At the time a friend had recommended three or four books of Science Fiction (by authors like Arthur C Clarke and Brian W Aldiss). When I bought David Pringle's guide to the 100 best SF novels from a small shop in London, it introduced me to a much  broader scope of fiction. A fiction based on science (to varying degrees),  that always had something important to say about us. David Pringle's guide  takes us through the \"golden age\" of SF, the sixties and  seventies \"experimental\" stage of SF and the best of the early  eighties SF. Thanks to Mr Pringle, I have travelled back in time, viewed  our planet from the future, witnessed history unravel itself from a  different prospective, I have flown into space and witness the development  and regression of the human race. Finally, I would like to mention one book  recommended in this guide that almost changed my life (dramatic words yes,  but I still think about this book 12 years later). That book is: Theodore  Sturgeon's \"More than Human\". I would never have read that book  if it were not for Mr Pringle's fine commentry.", "Helpfulness": 0.9473684210526315, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2K54HI6TR28HA"}}, {"Date": "on August 25, 2004", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9230769230769231, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2G6M8325LJ6LH"}}, {"Date": "on May 24, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A380H0RPMMOG3E"}}, {"Date": "on April 3, 2001", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on May 29, 2006", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3OCDD8CVPJH0R"}}, {"Date": "on September 17, 2009", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A18SDN3HYFVH2L"}}, {"Date": "on September 5, 2000", "Text": "Pringle's list of the 100 best science fiction novels starts with Orwell's  1984, giving brief descriptions of each novel.

Thanks to Mr. Pringle, I have been introduced to many great science fiction  classics, most recently \"The Year of the Quiet Sun\" by Wilson  Tucker.
