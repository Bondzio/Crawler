At first, I thought my Kindle didn't download the whole thing.  The editing is awful.  There is WAY too much about John Grey and other incidental characters we don't really care about.  But the absolute limit to my patience came when DG had Claire and John having sex just weeks after Jaime's \"supposed\" death!  What the f@%!*  Are you kidding me!?  I was disgusted and angry.  That was so unbelievably out of character for Claire (and Lord John) and cheapend the whole book (as if it wasn't bad enough already.)  I really hope that in DG's next installment that she gets back to the relationship of Jaime and Claire and their adventures.

It felt as if it was written by a completely different author.  The story line dragged on and on seemingly with no point.  Some sections were so boring that I just fast forwarded heaps of pages.  As dedicated readers invested in Jamie & Claire and then who grew to love Brianna & Roger, why is most of this book now about William and Lord John Grey?  Where I would read the other books in a few days or a week tops, this book took me more than 4 months to wade through.  As others have mentioned, the storyline is confusing with times not matching up, many detailed sections of the book seem absolutely pointless and I have a hard time understanding why I should care about William or Grey.  Both of their parts should have been minimal in this book with more focus on Jamie & Claire and Brianna & Roger.  I like the idea of the letter reading and the two sets of main characters being in different times and yet still communicating so to speak, but the focus of this book seemed to be on William and Grey and I found those sections both painfully difficult to read and quite boring.

Like others have said, the ending is abrupt and leaves you wondering where the rest of the book is hiding. The ending is really not an ending at all. It seems to be so much more like the ending of a chapter not an eight hundred page novel. I really disliked all the focus on other characters. Bri and Roger were fine but their story line was dull with no real action til near the end. However, that short amount of story line was never resolved in this book. The entire William-Lord Grey-Jamie triangle of suspense was overly drawn out. In all, the lack of resolution to any major story line was a complete disappointment. The book was interesting enough and well written and I enjoyed most of it, even the somewhat too long historical first half. But when I got to the end, I just couldn't believe it. How could anyone, the editor, friends reading it, a proofreader etc. think that this is an acceptable ending to a novel? Yes, indeed it sets you up for reading the next book in the series, but I would have purchased and read that new book even if Diana had resolved 100% of the outstanding cliff hangers in this book. There was no need to end it in such a way as to force us to buy the next book simply to find the answers to the issues raised in this book. In fact, I do plan to buy the next book because I feel compelled to find resolution for these unresolved plots. BUT, and this is a big but, my enthusiasm for this series is dampened now. I feel cheated by this book. I real feel that this book is all about creating a market and revenue for the next book.

I agree, it took a little getting into but I can't fault the author's choice to bring in more story lines using the characters she has introduced throughout the series, and making Lord John Grey a central character in this book only makes sense considering her separate novels devoted to John Grey.  I had a wonderful time reading the book but....it seemed this 828 page book was actually a 1600 page book arbitrarily cut in two.  Since she has warned us it takes her five years to write each novel I am afraid I may not make it until I find out how she resolves all the hanging stories introduced in the final fifty pages.  I assume there will be a follow up book and I am relieved she did not kill off any essential characters in this book (I was very concerned she might kill Jamie and end the series with this book.)  This is obviously not the end of the series, but its end seemed manipulative, and reminded me more of a soap opera or the tickler at the season final of a TV series to make certain we tune in next season.

Had my preordered copy in my hands by the day after it was released; living my wildest dream that I have a numbered first edition copy. (and a signed one also that followed a few days later!) In the interim, I read the other 6 three times while waiting... I hate to say it because I love Diana's books... this one was NOT worth the wait. I barely know where to begin without spoiling it for everyone else, but I will say I was knocked for a loop on page one when it started out as, not the beginning of a new book, but a different point of view on the ending to the last book. With the previous six fresh in my mind, this was kind of hard to swallow. Normally, it takes me three days, tops to get thru any one of the Outlander books, and that's with interruptions. This one took ten days, and the honest reason is because I kept putting it down - I couldn't find myself at all absorbed like I normally would be. The entire book is very, very choppy - most Outlander readers are used to hearing 75% of the story as told by Claire - in this book, Claire and Jamie both have less than half the focus on them. Which made it hard to follow because one had to adjust from the way of narration that one is used to. Bouncing back and forth and back and forth... Too much Lord John - he's got his own entire series for pity's sake. It finally started moving and getting really good around page 700 or so... I hit that this morning and didn't stop until I finished it... And when I did, I did the same thing that multiple other reviewers are saying - I went back and skimmed to see if I had missed pages. What happens to Jem? What happens to Roger? Why on earth even bring Buccleigh into the 20th century? To what ends? Jamie and Claire's fate remains uncertain, etc. Too too many loose ends. I understand that a cliffhanger will assure the next book to be a bestseller, but really... With how long it takes Diana to produce a book; it's cruel to her readers and fans that we'll have to wait that long to se what happens. All in all, it was a decent book, but by far NOT her best effort. I agree with other reviewers; it feels rushed, like she was pressed for deadline, etc. And I'm quite disappointed that there wasn't more Jamie and Claire in there... I also didn't care for the touch of the unrealistic with Ned Gowan and Arch Bug... it's the late 1700's.... the only people that lived past 50 years old were the wealthy. There was no valid reason whatsoever that Ned, but especially Arch should have even been still alive. Grr... I suppose it'll be another 3 or 4 times through all 7 of them before I get to find out what happens to everyone. I hope we don't have to wait that long!

I never minded the number of pages because reading about the lives of Jamie and Claire was such good entertainment.  A truly classy time-travel romance and adventure.  These two characters were brought to life, a great talent by any author, in all the previous books.  Sadly, this book was a complete let down.  Jamie and Claire were lost in the lives of so many other characters and happenings, and rarely were these tied in to any kind of ongoing storyline.  These two are the central characters, and will always remain so for me.  Very disjointed, almost as if they were written by the author in clumps and then stuck together in one book cover to make a deadline.  I don't care for the Lord John tie in, never did, and too much time was spent with that.  It really wasn't necessary for the cliff-hanger ending as her fans would continue to buy the ongoing saga, regardless.  I gave it two stars only because some of the adventures were about Jamie, Claire, Bree, Roger, etc., and because of the previous great books in this series.  Thank you, Ms. Gabaldon, for your previous books; I'll keep and re-read them all, but this hardcover will be donated to the senior citizen's reading library.

An example is the return of Simon Fraser to Scotland for burial and his wife, who was childless and waiting in Scotland for her husband's return from his soldiering.  The reality is that she and General Fraser lived in Vermont where their child, Simon Fraser, Jr., was born.  After Simon Fraser was killed at Saratoga, they fled to Canada and the child became a famous explorer and was a big part of the fur trade and exploration of western Canada.  The Fraser River in British Columbia is named for him.  General Fraser was buried onsite after being shot by Timothy Murphy at the urging of General Arnold, which was accurately described by Gabaldon in her book.

Unbelievable that that adjective could ever apply to an Outlander series novel! This read like a Lord John novel to me, and I have never been able to get past the first chapter in those books.

By the way, I'm almost over poor Roger being emasculated by Brianna, isn't it time he can do some things better than her? However the greatest disappointment was the ending, which was obviously thrown together and crammed in. I found much emotion lacking, was aghast that I wasn't more upset regarding things that occurred; (well to me, Claire didn't seem to be either,)and how it was tidied up quickly at the end. I even found myself somewhat thoughtful about a new relationship for Claire beginning. (I'm trying to leave out spoilers.) Let me clarify, Diana Gabaldon is still my favorite writer, and if she never writes another great novel her previous books still stand above all others to me. Yet as much as I love historical novels, I'm not in 5th grade and don't think she needs to go into detail quite as much to convey the storyline. I hope she remembers how to incur the excitement of the adventures of the previous novels, yet most of all to convey the personal interactions between the characters.

For instance, how did Rob know to look in Mac's office for information about time travelling?  how could Willie tell Jamie was his father when he could only see Jamie in shadow?  did Mac and Uncle Buck time-travel?  will Bree leave Mandy alone?", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AQZCNHD24E1HH"}}, {"Date": "on November 30, 2009", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8333333333333334, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A33M7PC0KMYBIC"}}, {"Date": "on January 13, 2010", "Text": "I put most of my comments on this book on my blog but I closed the book today thoroughly disappointed.

I really like how the author has developed the story by transitioning toward the next generation.  While I love Claire and Jamie, I enjoy their children just as well.  I was expecting more with Brianna and Roger because of how the last book ended, and so was a little disappointed with both the limited exposure they got in this book as well as the major loose ends in their storyline.  However, I loved how William's storyline was built in this book - I had always wondered if Diana would get to him at all or if he'd play more of a role at some point - so I forgive the neglect on the Brianna/Roger end of things.  The historical battle scenes at times were a little tedious, but I didn't think they were any more so than the battle of the regulation.  She hasn't surpassed Culloden yet but I'm OK with that.  I thought the meetings with historical characters were a little contrived at times, but no more than meeting King Louis, so as a device it worked as well as it has in her other books.  What was really disconcerting about this book was simply the number of loose ends and the way that they dangled.  This was the first of her books where I was stunned when and where the various storylines ended - very little closure at all on any of them!  Unlike the delightfully evil way Diana ended the last book with such a tantalizing clue, there are no clues at the end of this book as to where things might go, so I'm not even sure what I'm looking forward to other than resolution.

I am a big Outlander fan, having read or reread nearly all the books, listened to the audio books, and viewed the companions such as Outlandish Companion and the graphic novel.  I even read the Lord John books (which were entirely uninteresting to me).  That being said, the timeline is very choppy (the story skips between too many storylines, and people who the reader does not care about).  I don't mind some suspense, but to be left hanging while the author takes 150 pages to describe the flora and fauna is, frankly, exasperating.  I found myself skimming over entire sections much more in this book.  It is true that all of the books at times did go on a bit in terms of descriptions and historical background, but because the storyline was so solid, it was still pleasing to the reader.  In ECHO, the payoff for all of that extra detail is simply not there.  Also, there are numerous errors and inconsistencies.  I can't believe how absolutely ridiculous the main characters behave - completely out of their character - or at least the character they had been in the previous books.  Claire seems so weak.  It was shocking how much she fainted and cried in this book.  I did enjoy the current day storyline with Roger and Bree reading the letters from Claire, even though I have always found Bree's character to be overly defensive and frustrating, but found myself skipping forward to them to get a payoff and then going back to play a little catch-up.  The segments on Lord John and William were too long and, honestly, did not add the substance of the story in my opinion.  I am very disappointed in this book.  *spoiler* The ending leaves readers with little closure in a story you know will not be continued for possibly years, which is nearly unethical.  We are left with Jem missing, Roger having plunged through the stones but no idea where he landed, Bree in confrontation with a kidnapper in search of the gold, William on a violent spree after learning of his parentage, Jamie being hunted by soldiers, and no idea how the confrontation with Arch Bug ended.

When the 6 previous books ended, you had a sense of completion in the event Ms. Gabaldon chose not to write another book. I'll not go into the outline of the series because other commentators have done an excellent job of doing so. I did realize Ms. Gabaldon in \"Echo\" was writing a transition book because Jamie and Claire are getting old and I assume the \"series\" will eventually go on without them. Good business sense. But I must say when I got to the end of \"Echo\", I thought at first that I had missed reading some chapters but I did not. Being terribly aggravated, I thought the printers left some chapters out of this batch of books including the last 2 or 3 because certainly this is not the end!! Finally, I went on line and found I wasn't the only one that felt this way. BIG LAUGH ON ME. Enough of that disappointment. What was Ms. Gabaldon thinking; Lord John and Claire having sex???? GROSS; Jamie bringing Jenny back to America with him. Ugh!! I've had enough of her. But after saying all of this; here I am anxiously awaiting the next book! I recommend all the \"Outlander\" books.

I don't know where to begin.... Well, I suppose I should start with the beginning. I really loved the whole \"Mr. and Mrs. Bug incident\". Yes it was so sad, but it did add a \"looking over your shoulder\" kind of feeling to the story and threaded throughout the novel as well. I will always love Jamie and Clare's love scenes. I don't care how old they are!!!! I love reading about Jem! I love that kid! I really enjoyed reading about Ian and his new love (not going to mention her name). Wished the couple would have become a little more romantic though. I am so glad to feel some closure between he and Emily. Wow...the son (swiftest of lizards)! I would like to see Ian in his son's life in the future! I liked the historical fiction, but I feel it was overdone. It should be the storyline and plot taking center stage and the historical story behind it, rather than the other way around. I felt the author was so very excited to tell the historical elements of the story that the story of Jamie and Clare and their family somehow became overshadowed by history. I love love love the Outlander Series. It will always and forever be my first love when it comes to historical romance. However, I felt a little cheated. I like that we were able to get to know William, Jamie's son a little better, however I felt like I wanted to get to know him and connect with him more emotionally, like getting into his skin. I feel I only met him outwardly! I am not upset over what happened with John and Clare. I feel though that the reader was not given enough time to digest it. It was all wham bam thank you ma'am sort of thing. If this is going to be written into the novel, then I feel that the author should have allowed some sort of \"affection\" to be unfolded between John and Clare. Obviously not woman attraction or affection on John's part, but some sort of connection so that we could have eased into what transpired between them. It was SO unexpected that it didn't settle right. I do like John's character a lot. He is a gentleman and he is an attractive man. In previous novels, he and Clare do enjoy one another's company and brief conversations like in the 3rd and 4th novels. She nurses him back to health at one point or maybe twice. So I don't think it was completely far fetched that it happened. Plus they were both grieving. I just felt it wasn't as believable as it could have been. Jamie was only missing for only a couple of chapters it seems and therefore it wasn't enough time for the reader to accept what happens with John and Clare. That situation really had potential, but it felt short. In A Breath of Snow and Ashes, Jamie did write a letter to John...more like he left him his will. It was only logical for John to assume caretaker of Clare for his BFF! I mean he already raised Jamie Fraser's son! Why not care for his widow too! Anyway, I felt that the scenes with the most meat were rushed and cut too short. These were the scenes we had waited for all this time! I wish we could have extended on the whole Jamie and son scene at the end of the novel. It was soooo rushed and left me...words fail me. I'm not sure about the whole William Buckliegh Mackenzie time traveler extraordinaire thing! All I can say is that I am expecting soooo much more from novel number 8!!! I want answers! Let's face it! We all love a happy ending and reunion! That's why we loved Outlander and let's not forget Voyager's Jamie and Clare's reunion! Ahhh! What a scene! I want to see Willie getting to know Jamie and his roots. I want to see Jenny and Clare as friends. Let's find Jem! I don't want novel number 8 to be all history and in the end we find Jem and just throw and hasty happy scene together. Please take us on an adventure and bring back the love and romance full force as well! P.S. I'm glad Tom Christi is... (I will not say, but I like that)He was a good guy and deserved a better fate.

Not that I did not like the previous three books, but I was upset about them. Too much of Bree and Roger and sort of the story got lost. With this book, the story is again fascinating and I want to reread it again.

Jem and Mandy are so lovely, I wish they were with Jamie and Claire. the author is so good with how she portrays children, I am really impressed. Also, William's story is great, nice to know him better and his journey of discovery whose his true father was. The return to Lallybroch was good, with Ian's death and Leoghaire always causing rift raft between Jamie and Claire. I really do not know if Jamie has ever been attracted to her, kissing someone is not exactly an attraction, but momentary need, but you never know. And finally, Jamie and Claire, their awesome love and life. When she had to go to America by herself I sort of felt something might go wrong, I do not like them apart. And when she found out from Lord John, Jamie was dead, it was horrible, even though I knew he was not because they were late for the ship. I was shocked what transpired between Claire and Lord John. Kind of could not find myself. I understand, but.....weird, somehow. It will cause many problems, I guess. I like Lord John and the way he loves Jamie, the way he respects and likes Claire and loves William. There are a lot of good things in the book. It is fast reading and very engaging.

I flat-out adore her. I've devoured 6 of her books thus far and look forward to more. As a writer myself I have to say the pace of this book does indeed drag and the character arcs can be confusing r/t timelines. I can only speak to what I personally found problematic: lonnnnnnnnnnng, excruciatingly described details of historic battles, and digressions into complement characters that weren't absolutely germaine to the overall story, IMHO. I hang on pretty much every word this woman crafts; her descriptions of character's moods & actions are a superlative only a short list of writers can be credited with. I have come to feel Claire & Jamie are 'family'; I watch the tv show like a fiend, LOL, unplugging the phone so no one can interrupt my time travels. :):):)  I've seen all her appearances and I have the privilege of chatting with her on Twitter. But this book\u2026\u2026is heavy ( not talking about the weight) in terms of historic battle detail I'm not convinced the book wouldn't be better without. Because she has been so crazy-successful with this series, I kinda wonder if her editors don't maybe purposefully edit less, just because they want fans to have plenty to get their teeth into ??? Just a thought. I am melancholy to say, I too am disappointed in this book and it breaks my heart. Like so many others here, a visit with Claire & Jamie, Roger & Brianna is the last thing I do at night. Ms Gabaldon's books have lived on my nightstand for over a year now and I cherish them. I've stuck with this book out of immense respect for her, but very uncharacteristically have begun reading other books in between. I see that many others here have done the same. Hoping Ms. Gabaldon can glean some learning from the input of her devoted and adoring fan base.

The books also focuses on many different story lines and yet they are all tied together as well there is cast of many in this one so be prepared of course Jamie and Claire and there unconditional love for one another and now twelve years have gone by and in the middle of the American Revolution too. Brianna and Roger and family go back to the 20th century for Health reasons and not easy to readjust to the 20th century from the 18th century. There is also the struggles of Fergus family and of course there is Ian one of my favorite characters and the many changes he goes through. Yes Jamie's son William and Lord John Grey are also in this storyline. William is now an English soldier and of course Jamie is a rebel patriot Colonial in the American army....could it get any more dramatic father and son on opposing sides. Also some new delightful characters I really enjoyed are Denny and his sister Rachel whom is a Army doctor for the Americans and are Quakers. I really found this storyline interesting and enjoyable.

I read several of these reviews before I read \"An Echo in the Bones\" on my Kindle and pomised myself that I must read more slowly (it was tough to bring back old details) than I would have with the hardbacks which I raced through and realized that I'd missed a lot of detail.  Reading at a more liesurely pace was worth it.  The old details came back and the multiple story lines stayed intact, yet somwhat relevant to the whole.  I thought several times that the William & Lord John adventures, other than where they intersect with Claire and Jamie might have been better served as a separate piece, but that is my only real criticism other than the fantastical coincidences of characters' paths crossing - a little tough to accept so many.  I too, would prefer more of the \"story\" than the surrounding historical details, but with all the research that's been done, it would be a shame not to share it, if only for those who are uneducated regarding the times.  The fact that we are left hanging with the Roger/Briana phase promises that there will be another book; obviously there will be more of Claire and Jamie and the American Revolution and the development of the relationship with William and we won't be too surprised if there is a full family reunion in the works at some point.

After all, in spite of their seemingly charmed lives, Jamie and Claire are not going to live forever. Jamie is what, in his 50's now? with Claire a few years older. And Jamie still leading troops and soldiering, and up to now, he has been lucky not to be seriously injured.
