Just a few months ago, I read the book and I absolutely  LOVED it! At first, I was wary about reading it, it had a lot of techno  science talk in it which I thought I wouldn't understand, but I did get the  basic idea and I thought the book was fantastic!  It is suspensful and  really enjoyable. I recommended it to my friends, but they were like  \"Why would you want to read THAT?\" (I'm a thirteen-year-old girl  and they were like...whatEVER!) But I really really liked it. I love the  movie too, but the book is more thrilling, if you ask me. I don't see how  anyone could not like the movie though and refuse to read the book  afterward.

Other times, the story is the predominant feature and the scientific parts of the book are overlooked.  Jurassic Park is one of the rare books that pleases both perspectives.  While some of the ideas are far-fetched (what sci-fi book doesn't have those?), the story makes it all believable and entertaining at the same time.  The book was so well-written that it puts the movie version to shame!  Even Steven Spielberg (in my opinion) could not capture all the book had to offer.  This is a quick read that could be completed in a weekend or over a few nights.

This book is very fast paced and when I read it, I had a really hard time putting it down.  I  read it cover to cover almost non-stop.  I can imagine this book becoming a  little more popular again with all the talk of cloning going on and while  the ideas in this book are far-fetched, I'm sure it will help some people  make opinions on whether or not cloning is good or bad.  So, if you're  looking for a great, faced paced sci-fi thriller, you may want to pick up  Jurassic Park.  I also feel the book is much better than the movie despite  the fact that Spielberg directed JP in 1991.  The story line is MUCH more  devolped and the ending is entirely different!

In \"Jurassic Park\", one of Crichton's better novels, there is a basic formula: Dinosaurs + Murphy's Law = Trouble.  Our hero, Alan Grant, a paleontologist with a healthy respect for dinosaurs, and his assistant Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist, have dug up some interesting dinosaur fossils in the Montana badlands.  Into their camp comes an invitation from a millionaire entrepreneur named John Hammond with a proposal much more interesting: a visit to his unfinished theme park on an island off the coast of Costa Rica.  Off they go in Hammond's private plane, with a lawyer named Donald Gennaro and a slightly wacko mathematician named Ian Malcolm who specializes in chaos theory.  What they find on the island blows their minds into the stratosphere: Hammond's scientists have successfully managed to clone and breed living dinosaurs.  Wowie-kazowie, what a terrific idea for a theme park!  Or so say Hammond and Gennaro, thinking of the astronomical bottom line, but Grant, Sattler, and especially Malcolm, have their doubts: living creatures are unpredictable, you can't know what they will do or how they will react, and if something starts to go wrong in a small way, the subsequent chain of events will guarantee a screw-up in a big way.  Chaos theory rules after all.  ... And when the raptors prove to be almost as smart, and much stronger and faster, than humans, Murphy's Law starts to take over with a vengeance.  ...There's a lesson to be learned in all of this and Crichton grabs us and propels us along in a dizzying ride through almost 400 pages, but the moral is clear: Just because you can try to play God, doesn't necessarily mean it's a great idea.  Nature had a reason to make the dinosaurs extinct, and Mother Nature doesn't appreciate mere mortals messing in her business.  Crichton's characters suffer from his usual lack of development, they're two-dimensional and never really leap off the page, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars; because the story, and the dinosaurs, are so fascinating that Crichton could have written another 400 pages and held me mesmerized to the end.

It has a powerful feeling left inside me because of the fact that something of this caliber could happen. He uses real science together with imagination creating a dream world of dinosaurs. His description is amazing you feel as if you are right next to them feeling their pain and horror. I have to be fair though he showed detail but the fact that he shows every computer screen and the DNA codes made the book a little cluttered. I personally liked the character Ian Malcolm because he reminds me of myself in that he's stuck up about the fact that he knew that they would escape. This book is set apart fro mall others because what if the raptors had gotten onto the mainland? They could have killed a lot of people and that one day something like that might just happen because of the growing interest in genetics and DNA. It even leaves you guessing at the end (did it really work?). It's an amazing plotline that someone would think of an amusement park with something that dangerous and trying to do something so impossible for money is amazing but people might do that.

Better late than never I suppose. This was by far a much better story than what was conveyed in the first feature film. I had no idea that many of he principal characters differed so tremendously from how they were portrayed in the film. On the big screen, Hammond is portrayed as an eccentric, naive, filthy-rich, and daudling old man. In Crichton's book, he is still a filthy-rich old man, however, he is cold, ruthless, arrogant and calculating. The tyranosaur attack, and the subsequent chase of Grant and the kids, was much more frightening and exciting in the original text. As enjoyable as the movies were, it's a shame they deviated so far from the book.

To garner  support for the park, the developer has asked a number of scientists to  visit and to evaluate the facilities and animals. One of these individuals  is a mathematician whose field of expertice is chaos and catastrophe  theory. Thus, the readers learns a little about molecular biology,  paleontology, paleobotany, and an exciting new area of mathematics (a  common characteristic of Dr. Crichton's novels that I find enjoyable is the  education one receives over a wide area of topics). However, things go  wrong and the reader is soon caught up in the adventure. But, I should  point out that both the book and the 1994 film make some serious scientific  errors, particularly in biochemistry and molecular biology. (For example,  Dr. Crichton has his characters insert a genetic \"flaw\" into the  DNA of the dinosaurs so that, if a dinosaur would escape, it could not  survive in the \"wild.\" The dinosaurs are made to be incapable of  biosynthesizing the amino acid lysine. However, humans [and other mammals]  also can't synthesize lysine! Lysine is one of the nutritionally essential  amino acids [just ask any body builder who often supplement their diets  with lysine tablets]. Nevertheless, humans are able to survive without this  metabolic pathway!) But note that, even with thses flaws, I still gave the  book five stars. These errors (and the \"nonerrors\") get readers  to thinking about these exciting new fields of human endeavor. And, they  start searching for the answers themselves. I see students doing this all  the time. Crichton should be applauded.

I have always found the skeletal remains exciting!  The first time I saw the book \"Jurassic Park\", my best friend in High School was reading it.  I asked her what it was about and she just said \"Oh God Holly, I can't and will not put it down!\"  I was intrigued. After college I had read most of Michael Crichton's books but had still not read \"Jurassic Park\".  Then BOOM...the movie is released.  I loved the movie.  I decided to buy the book and see if it was just as thrilling.  \"Thrilling\" hardly seems fit to describe the book! (my paperback has nail indentations on it!) As I have reviewed before...M.C. loads the first few chapters with some basic, easy to comprehend scientific knowledge...Making it easier to understand the essence of what's going on...even the morality...which is barely discussed in the movie.  I'm talking about the idea of harvesting blood from mosquitos preserved in amber for millions of years.  Mosquitos that John Hammond, (the somewhat delusional \"father\" of the Dino-theme park idea) harvests to extract Dino-DNA.  ( He believes many of these mosquitos liked to feed from dinosaurs...Could they really do that? Someone tell me.  Dino skin must be inches thick, but anyway,)  He processes the DNA, filling in some missing links, and hatches the little creepies on Isla Nublar, a very secluded and resticted island.  So there it begins. Talk of Dino-DNA is nothing more than a simple cartoon to watch in the movie ( probably for a younger audience to understand), but is discussed in depth in the book.  The main characters are loving, delightful and sometimes downright sarcastic and keep you laughing.  But don't be fooled.  John Hammond has a dream to open a theme park, \"Jurassic Park\" to the world.  A Place where dinos exsist in confined habitats, guarded by electric fences.  He and the main characters on the island enjoy themselves submerged in a multi-millionare-old enviroment, but I ask you...what happens when the elctricity accidentally shuts down......", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1KLG8F5APLM2N"}}, {"Date": "on July 17, 2001", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2JIWY9DXD3YV"}}, {"Date": "on August 20, 1997", "Text": "Well, I know that little guidelines page tells me I must resist the compelling urge to not write about what others say on this fine book...well what can I say? I'm weak. Too weak to resist the pulling force to my keyboard, and typing a review to try and correct all the misleading comments on this fine piece of literature.  I liked the book, in fact I loved it. It is truly one of the finest and one of Michael's finest books ever written. I can't be the great author he is and type in his defence, but I'll try.  Micheal is a fine writer who has written a fine book, it informs and entertains me, which few novels do. It is true, some of the fact that I am taught is false. Raptors may be quite a bit taller than the book explains them as. Well, I know Michael twisted fact into fiction a bit in the book, but if these facts are so important as many dinosaur super genius' seem to think, well, why write the story at all, why write any story. Fiction IS a distortion of the facts, I mean, if perfect fact is what you strain yourselves to see (or read) then find a nice cozy atlas to curl up by the fire with. Everyone knows that it is impossable to clone dinosaurs with todays technology, the DNA breaks up overtime. But, that is why the book has been placed in the fiction section, IT'S NOT REAL. If fact is issue number one, then all fiction books are too far fetched for you. But action, adventure, and some education on the side is what I found in Jurrasic Park. Of course I know it's not 100% pure unprocessed fact, but that just makes it more fun to read. I doubt the book would be nearly as fun to read if it was more factual about the Raptor size. I can't see everyone running terrified from a pack of 1/2 foot dinosaurs, it's not as scary to most readers, and Crichton knows that, that's why he jacked up their height. The velociraptor was the closes thing he could find to a 6 foot carnisaur. And at that time the \"REAL\" 6 foot Raptor hadn't yet been discovered. So Michael made the changes for you, the readers, to heighten the reading experiance for us. So, remember that if you are a factual perfectionist if you read this book, and if the twists bug you that much, go to the non fiction section next time. I'm sure they keep accurate records on the proper mating ritual of the duck billed plautipus. If your not that type, prepare yourself for a action packed, on the edge of your seat, and interesting read.

I encourage anyone who enjoyed the movie to pick up this fast-paced story of genetic manipulation today.  I DO have to admit they cast Jeff Goldblum PERFECTLY.  He fit Ian Malcom to a TEE. He is one of my favorite fictional characters, and when you read the story you'll know why.  One great annoyance I had with the movies was how a scene from the original 'Jurassic Park' book found its way into 'The Lost World' movie (the opening scene for instance, and the T-Rex thrusting its head through the waterfall...) and the ending of 'The Lost World' was SO different from the book as to make me wonder if they were going to release a novelized version of the movie since it was almost 100% different than the book.  Dennis Nedry was another great casting job (remember Newman from Seinfeld...?) and, well forget the differences, this story deserves to be read, mostly because it is timely and incredibly entertaining.  When was the last time you heard someone say the movie version of a book was better? In this case, the movie cannot even hold a candle to Chrichton's amazing story of bringing the dead back to life by use of genetic science.

Crichton's skill is not necessarily in his prose (although I do credit him with inventing the single-sentence paragraph-a tool most suspense authors use today), but in his ability to erect scientific monuments of stone with ideas of straw.  The accusations that his characters are flat are baseless.  Simply because he doesn't droll on ad nauseum about every mundane facet of his characters' backstory or emotive sentiments does not mean they are not lively or relatable, and who can't relate to someone whose in the grip of pulse pounding terror?  The real characters here are the vicious antediluvian beasts, and he brings them to life with unmatched skill.  The dinosaurs people saw in the movie Jurassic Park were the direct product of Michael Crichton's mind, and their personalities are on dramatic display everywhere.  In the end, Crichton was a creative genius, taking thoroughly researched science and marrying it to fantastical imagination, adding a dose of wit and wisdom, he left us with stories to share and enjoy and learn from (both scientifically and morally) for generations to come, and Jurassic Park was his magnum opus: the testimony to everything that he did best.

There are also a lot more human-dinosaur interactions, which is inevitable considering the expense and technical difficulty of CGI when the movie was made, but those interactions are, in my opinion, the lifeblood of the story.

Iliked tis book because it was realistic, descriptive, and teaches a lesson.  It's very realistic, so realistic it's terrifying.  An example of this is when the scientists  take dinosaur DNA from blood and clone it.  I can actually see scientists,  in real life doing this an creating prehistoric animals.  Another realistic  part was how the dinosaurs managed to breed even though it was supposed to  be impossible.  The dinosaurs were all made females, but the geneticists  made the mistake of using DNA from animals with the ability to change their  gender.  So the dinosaurs were breeding and no one knew about it.  This was  a believeable explination of how the dinosaurs were able to breed.  Another factor that made this novel good, was its being very descriptive.  The way Crichton describes the velociraptors seem smarter and scarier than  they were in the movie.  These dinosaurs could create and execute plans  working together.  They could also run, jump, hide, and slash people open  with these giant claws on their feet.  The Tyrannosaurus was also scary  dinosaur, but it was also sort of stupid.  The velociraptors were better  than it.  For one thing, the T-rex could only see her prey if it was  moving.  Also it was a solitary hunter that didn't and couldn't hide.  And  the only plan it could execute was chase a herd of smaller dinosaurs and  hope to snacth a weakling or a baby.  Anyway, the novel was very  descriptive (it gave me an opinion on the best preditor, which happens to  be the velociraptor).  One thing about life that I learned from this  novel is that people can't control it.  The creators of Jurassic Park  expected to be able to control and handle nature.  They thought they could  keep the animals from breeding, of course they failed but, that didn't stop  the people.  When the finally realized they were wrong about controlling  nature and life, it was too late for them and may other people (if you know  what I mean).  For all of these reasons, Jurassic Park is a great book.  It is one of the few truly frightening books I've ever read, and yes, it's  better than the movie.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2PRUREKNUFX02"}}, {"Date": "on January 14, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1L55B1BPR5XQD"}}, {"Date": "on January 2, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A29V8GFEY9KWU2"}}, {"Date": "on June 3, 2004", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A18YY3ZONN7QEP"}}, {"Date": "on April 17, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A263YB2DOREXJ2"}}, {"Date": "on May 19, 2013", "Text": "I began this book with the expectation that it would be as remarkable as the movie, but what I got was 100 times better!

Hammond is the CEO and founder of InGen, a company that has figured out how to mix dinosaur DNA with frog DNA to essentially bringing them back from the dead. He plans to showcase the dinosaurs in this theme park and have people tour it. He invites paleontologists Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler (Alan\u2019s grad student), mathematician Ian Malcolm, and his two grandchildren to tour the park before opening. In the middle of the tour something happens, something bad. Throughout the whole book I wanted to keep reading. The adventure starts when they get to the island. All of the characters are described well enough so it is like you\u2019re getting to know them. The dinosaurs are described nicely, as well, so you can easily picture the theme park. As you are reading you slowly get immersed into the park more and more so you might get a feel of what kind of situation one of the characters might be in. The suspense is one of the major things keeping you reading though.

From a paleontological standpoint, much of dinosaur behavior and movement is based on pure assumption on Crichton's part.  The Dilophosaurus poison thing can be overlooked, as can the double-sized Velociraptors.  I don't appreciate Crichton's half-research on dinosaurs and I think the T-rex's movement based vision was a flaring idiotic idea.  Otherwise, the characters, as in almost all of Crichton's literature, were fairly shallow.  Also, how did the Jurassic Park scientists move the embryo to the egg?  Crichton himself admits he neglected to include this in his novel because he couldn't figure out a way around it. But enough griping.  Let's address what was spectacular about this novel.  The plot was mastermind, and the action overall is superior to Crichton's other books.  The elements of suspense Crichton includes show Crichton's great skill at writing contemporary fiction.  It's too bad that this was the last novel Crichton wrote as a story to be told instead of a book to be easily developed into a screenplay for a movie.  Plot is a ten but character underdevelopment, scientific assumptions, paleontological guesses, and half-hearted unresearched references to Chaos Theory (a theory that I put stock in, its just that Crichton obviously fails to do it justice) bring my rating down to an eight.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AV2JO0JP9OYZC"}}, {"Date": "on January 27, 2011", "Text": "The world Jurassic was simply gibberish until Crichton touched it and brought new life to the concept of dinosaur fiction and biomedical technology.

Crichton, was an MD and created the show E.R. also, this is a great example for writers and scientists alike because Crichton tried to maximize his potential.

Its fast pace(doesn't slow the book down for anything except to explain some character backrounds) along with his dangerous dino's theme park theme(which sounds amazingly possible) make this book the best he will ever write.", "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3IDVPHK010YCS"}}, {"Date": "on March 8, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2V4W6IXPGYX4G"}}, {"Date": "on May 15, 2000", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1N9243H1V4SRY"}}, {"Date": "on April 2, 2013", "Text": "I remember seeing the movie in theaters and being totally blown away by it.

My favorite novels by Crichton are JP 1 & 2, Sphere, Airframe, and Prey.  The only books I didn't like were State of Fear, and Next, both of those are super preachy and don't have a compelling story in my opinion, more about Crichton stating his beliefs and less about a good read.  Pirate Latitudes and Micro that have been released after his death are both ok, but not great.  I think other authors had to finish both of those books.

It started out with some very good action and suspence but went downhill from that. After Alan Grant gets to a mysterious island filled with man-eating dinosaurs its almost too predictable what will happen, but hey that reason better be why you read the book, to see dinosaurs rip off peoples heads and slice open their stomach. After the dinos escape its a life or death race to get off the island. I definetly would suggest this book to a dino freak but no one else. The settings are hard to picture and leave you confused in the later chapters. The island is a prehistic landscape and is hard to picture since we don't know what it looks like. Another reason a thought it was bad was because it didn't describe the dinos well enough. It would be very helpful if Micheal included pictures of the dinos instead of just telling you it was a pretyhuioptyresasaurous. The only reason I like the book is because is has creature violence, which is my favorite, and it has many action sequences. The end is filled with action and has you guess who rein supreme, the humans or dinosaurs. So over all it had a good story line, hard to understand settings, unpictureable dinos, but a good action twist at the end.

Michael Crichton proves his brilliance by creating a whole new world of dinosaurs, in a way that may seem possible in the distant future.  He creates the dinosaurs by taking DNA out of ancient mosquitoes that are trapped in amber from the dinosaur time period.  It's amazing how much time, thought, and research it had to take him to create his brilliant world.  Most people watch the movie, and just expect the book to be just the same.  But that is not correct.  The novel has many more differences than the movie. For example, the novel has a totally different ending than the first movie.  In fact, the ending of the first Jurassic Park novel is used in the second Jurassic Park movie when they discover the birdcage and travel through it in the midst of the pterodactyls.  If you have not read the book, and enjoyed the movie, I would recommend reading this novel.  Some think this novel is kind of childish, and I can see why they think that because of the dinosaurs, but I must say I really enjoyed it. It opens up the imagination, and makes you really wonder if re-creating dinosaurs would really be possible.
