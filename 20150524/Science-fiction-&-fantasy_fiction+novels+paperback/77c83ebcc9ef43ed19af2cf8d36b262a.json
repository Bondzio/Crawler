Harry's Arc Light, with a little bit of his Invasion thrown in, Lightning Fall offers a frightening look at the aftereffects of an EMP attack on the western United States, that threatens to not only condemn untold millions to death in the affected areas, but rend the United States itself asunder, aided by the manipulations of a President (a thinly-veiled Hillary Clinton, complete with First Husband and former President \"B.J.\") bound and determined to \"never let a crisis go to waste\" and use it to ensure enduring political power for her party.  The author's extensive research into not only EMP effects themselves but disaster preparedness is readily apparent throughout the book, and his depiction of the machinations of Washington politics, as well as the efforts of other nations to take advantage of America's weakness, are also on the mark.  The \"To be continued...\" note at the end left me frustrated, but I consider that to be the mark of a good story that I want to see the culmination of; I'll certainly be eager to see the sequel.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3FDNK4HN2GLJT"}}, {"Date": "on May 30, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A14RRG3K73D88Z"}}, {"Date": "on April 22, 2014", "Text": "Reminiscent of \"One Second After\" Lightning Fall treats an attack on the United States from a more broadbased perspective.  An EMP attack over San Francisco leaves the US west of the Rockies without power, without mobility, and starving millions.  At the same time a nuke explodes on the New Orleans waterfront leaving that port destroyed and unusable for years.  The third attempt happens a minute too late and is shot down before it can cripple the east coast.  Bill Quick looks at what this would do to the US across the country; from San Francisco's gay preppers, to Muncie Indiana's mid-western small town folks, to suburban Philadelphia life changes.  And for those caught in the brunt of the attack life becomes hard, brutal, and short.  Washington DC is spared and the only hope for the country is a thinly disguised Bill and Hillary Clinton.  The only downside to the book - it's half over with the sequel coming in Spring 2015.

What really bothered me about this book is that once the lights went out, all minorities contributed nothing more to the story than being there simply to be cultural stereotypes. I really like stories of disaster and survival but I didn't enjoy one thing about this one.

I found the author's political views to mirror my own. What I do object to, however, is using the platform of a novel such as this to proselytize for the homosexual agenda. Really, author? Is it necessary for your storyline to describe disgusting homosexual sex acts in graphic detail? I found myself simply skimming over the portions of the book that dealt with the homosexual couple and reading only those sections that did not contain information about their sex lives. For that reason, I cannot bring myself to purchase another of this author's books, nor can I recommend this book to friends.", "Helpfulness": 0.2857142857142857, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AP5VYABEHMF4L"}}, {"Date": "on April 17, 2014", "Text": "How about a novel that isn't based on a prepper?
