While such a list is no better than the taste and education of the compiler (which varies enormously) such a list -- even a mediocre one -- is often very useful when one is trying to decide which of perhaps thousands of books in a genre (note:  I give this book five stars for its function and usefulness, not for the particular quality of the choices or reviews).  It makes the reader aware of what is \"out there\" and what others consider good or otherwise noteworthy.  I am curious as to why these readers think a 290 page book would contain the *complete* text of a hundred novels.  A certain minimal intelligence is needed here.  Dissatisfied buyers -- presumably SF readers -- should use this book as intended. They should find it useful.
