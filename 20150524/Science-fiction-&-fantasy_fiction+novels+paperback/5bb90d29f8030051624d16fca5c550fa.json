It tells the story of Coraline, a curious young girl who discovers a secret door in her house.  The door takes her to what seems like a duplicate of her house, with parents that look like hers but have buttons for eyes.  They want to keep Coraline and she has to use her bravery and cleverness if she wants to escape from this other world and return to her own.  This was the first graphic novel that I have read and I was very impressed.  The artwork was done beautifully and really grasped your attention.  My only complaint is that it took me much longer to read the book than I expected because I was so interested in every detail of the artwork.  The story was very good, and would appeal to older children who enjoy fantasy and horror stories.  Some of the pictures are frightening, so I would not recommend it for young children.  I am now very interested in going to see the movie!", "Helpfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1B07OKFD7L843"}}, {"Date": "on January 29, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A13G1TKIKHGV3F"}}, {"Date": "on September 12, 2008", "Text": "My 10 year old daughter is not a big reader and given her age she's in the \"between\" stage.

Noted illustrator P. Craig Russell does a consistently compelling job in communicating the mundane and ethereal horrors of Gaiman's story and tailoring the images in such a way that they can be appreciated by children as well as by adults. The emphasis here is more toward impressing children, I would wager, even as McKean aimed for a universal audience with his stark interpretations of Coraline's harrowing adventures with the \"Other Mother\". The result is a graphic novel that incorporates the bulk of Gaiman's original text and combines visuals that truly complement the trajectory and tones of the overall story. Nicely realized work.

I am from Germany and we just have read the book \"Coraline\" at my school. I think that it would be a great book for younger people to read it, because for them it would be a nice entertainment. For young children Coraline is a brave hero, who discovers a scary world. But for learning English it would also be useful to read the comic for older children because of the fitting vocabulary. P. C. Russell is very talented and the pictures are really great and so it is funnier to learn vocabulary and it isn't like an exercise to understand English texts, but you learn.

For reasons unknown, Neil Gaiman seems to allow artist P. Craig Russell to adapt Gaiman's prose work, turning them into \"graphic novels.\"  It's not a match made in heaven.  Russell's illustrations add NOTHING to Gaiman's fine prose.  If anything, Russell's illustrations tend to steal the thunder of unleashed & wild imagination that comes from reading a Gaiman story or novel.  P. Craig Russell's artwork is pedestrian (at best)and, truth be told, \"mundane\" would be a more accurate word to describe it.  His illustrations are so mediocre that they actually detract from Gaimans' fine storytelling abilities.  I do not know why they continue this collaboration...perhaps they're trying to hit the audience with Attention Deficiency Disorder, those who might not otherwise read a book unless EVERY last detail is reproduced in colorful illustration.  Much of CORALINE'S magic works in the same way that old radio programs worked (in the pre-television days) or the way songs worked so well (in the pre-MTV days)..Gaiman's prose allows the reader to open up the mind's cathedrals to conjure up our own nightmarish & magical worlds.  Russell's intrusion on this sacred bond between writer &  reader breaks an otherwise near-sacred relationship.  A movie version of this book?  Yes.  I can see how this will allow the story to flourish in a new way and direction (although I imagine some of the more gripping psychological aspects of CORALINE might be lost when released in cinema houses...of course, this remains to be seen).  As with P. Craig Russell's other adaptations of Neil Gaiman's prose works, his illustrations only cheapen what are otherwise masterfully told stories.  Please DO NOT think that I am knocking P. Craig Russell's known abilities/skill as an artist: his collaboration with Neil Gaiman on an ORIGINAL/JOINT effort, such as their joint work on SANDMAN'S \"Ramadan\" remains one of the finest comic books in existence.  However, Russell's adaptations of Gaiman's prose work are worlds removed from their beautiful, landmark issue of SANDMAN...and, instead, makes the CLASSICS ILLUSTRATED comics of old seem like masterpieces by comparison.  I'd love nothing more than to see Gaiman/Russell collaborate on a comic-book such as \"Ramadan\" (or the later SANDMAN-related story \"Death in Venice\").  However, Russell & Gaiman should do their reputations...as well as their readers...a favor and stop creating graphic novels out of Gaiman's fine prose.  It insults Gaiman's legacy, as well insulting  the intelligence of Gaiman's readers.", "Helpfulness": 0.375, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2AIIEGC9MKHMV"}}, {"Date": "on November 11, 2008", "Text": "The story was very interesting but I was shocked to find out this was a comic strip book.
