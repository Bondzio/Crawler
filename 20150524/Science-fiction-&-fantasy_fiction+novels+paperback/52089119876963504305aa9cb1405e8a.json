This author does an excellent job of telling a story of what could happen during a life changing event where the world as you know it no longer exists.  I've read many books throughout the years and have to say this is defintiely one of the best in this genre.  We as a modern society have insurance on practically everything...car, life, home, etc.  What insurance do we have on our family and the ability to keep them safe in a world gone mad?  How would you make it back to your loved ones if the grid went down and you found out your car and cell phone were affected by a catastrophic event?  Do you have the means in your vehicle to travel 50 miles or so on foot?  In the middle of a Southern drought or Northern frigid winter?  Do you have a plan in place for your wife and children to survive a prolonged event without assistance during your absence?  If you think you can count on \"Big Brother\" to be there when you need him the most, look what happened during recent hurricane events.

Its a maybe 3 for this genre but I will up it to 4 for a couple reasons besides there is no 3.5 in Amazon's system. Many early poor reviews seem to be for a self-published version of this book that was a typo-grammar disaster. I read a 2013 revised version published (and edited) by Plume/Penguin. This is a prepper book about TEOTWAWKI. It's linked to a blog called angeryamerican.net. Like most prepper fiction, the plot is short on realism while the detailed descriptions of equipment are over the top. The reason for this is simple -- most prepper \"novels\" are infomercials for the prepper lifestyle and products. If you like prepper stuff, you tend to like the books. The worst part about this genre is that every protagonist seems super pleased that the end finally came and justified their decision to spend their children's college fund on the most expensive and redundant prepper gear/systems/plan imaginable. And because super-self-reliant people are ego-maniacs the protagonists are usually unpleasant (David Crawford has a decent prepper novel called Collision Course that deals with this obnoxious issue in an ironic way). They tend to look with utter disdain on anyone who wasn't as prepared as they were (John Wesley Rawles is the pioneer of these novels and his books are known for all these qualities). Morgan Carter is an above average character for this type. In fact, if you are willing to swallow some prepper Kool-Aid then you will better enjoy this infomercial. I did because I knew what I was getting into. I am a bit of an urban prepper and a veteran. Yes, the military stuff here is unrealistic and will bug veterans. No former First Sergeant will accept Sarge\u009d as a nickname. And the hero is carrying an RV on his back not a true bugout bag. No one in average physical shape will hump a 60 lbs. ruck over 200+ miles. And when you add up his gear (two of everything?!?!?), with water and MREs, you get closer to 100 lbs. But remember, its an infomercial. Morgans journey is a bit of a stretch. Cold water kills people in Florida winters (I was a winter Ranger at Eglin and wont forget that cold). So do head wounds with a 9 mm. Morgan survives both. The morality is a bit simplistic and the ending seems too good to be true. The surviving dystopian federal government isnt trying too hard with their martial law. But preppers need to believe their endgame scenario to justify the toys. They often mock the seriously religious in these books but prepper faith is almost a religion of its own. So BELIEVE, at least for this book, and enjoy yourself while taking notes for some cool toys. I like prepper toys myself -- especially guns. Recommended for preppers. And for non-preppers who want to read a better than average example from this genre.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1NS7UUKRZ7CO9"}}, {"Date": "on February 10, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1T2R9NW0WGT9Z"}}, {"Date": "on March 13, 2014", "Text": "Whoa, just going to azon to check the pubdate on this and wow, what a diverse reaction in the reviews!  It's got a strong 4 star rating with close to 800 reviews at this point in time so do I need to add another review, not really, but my impression anyway :-) This is a cross between post-apocalyptic and survivalist fiction.  The end of the world as we knew it as experienced by a few preparedness/survivalist/gung-ho/ex-military types and their families.  Nothing wrong with that!  Sounded interesting to me but a bit different from the usual dystopian post apocalypse novel being turned out today.  The scariness comes in knowing that these events and the way people in general react to them are realistic.  This could happen.  This is definitely aimed at men, whatever the opposite of chick lit is, that's what this is, barely a female present and testosterone oozing from the pages.  I haven't read anything like it since back in the day when I sampled a couple of Mack Bolan (The Executioner) books LOL  This read like an action movie for me; I could visualize it as it happened.  Lots of action and violence.  I mean the main guy kills three people before the book's barely started and they were \"justifiable\".  All the good guys kill bad guys all over the place and they are always \"justifiable\".  Really over the top, action hero movie violence.  If this was a serious book, these actions would be deplorable but set within this fictional world it was a lot of fun. I didn't like either of the young men who were trying to get back to their wives and kids but Sarge was a mean old coot with a heart in their somewhere and he's the only character I actually liked.  Anyway, this is one of those books, I'll say I loved, not for any literary merit but simply because it gave me an adrenaline rush and it was fun.

He has to get home to central Florida.  Living near Tallahassee and knowing Highway 27 south, I can vouch that all of these little roads and towns he went through look exactly like they were described.  The author provides so much detail in description that you can almost smell the earth, the river, the rain, and the pine forests.  He even got the temperature right for November weather.  Morgan is a prepper with a Bug-Out-Bag fit to kill.  He has stuff you'll want to add to yours.  The things he does and the methods in which he does them could really help some of those idiots on the Doomsday Preppers show.  He doesn't start walking home immediately--he spends the night in the car and goes through his bag, deciding what to keep and what he doesn't need--his analysis is interesting.  His walk and listen technique added so much time to his trip, but he stayed with the drill.  He doesn't take more than about 60 seconds with a person before he can size him up and decide if he's a friendly or not.  If not, he takes the offense right away and backs people down or leaves them in a puddle.  The girl who won't leave him alone and tags along is just the type of person you DON'T want walking with you and she nearly gets him killed several times.  I wanted to slap her silly.  I hope every man who reads the book resolves to say NO louder and longer than Morgan did, or you probably wouldn't make it home.

The writer is obviously what we in the military called a \"gear-queer\", but this will be very helpful to anyone who lacks training for wilderness survival. What you lack in training you can make up for with gear. The story it'self is very well written with very believable characters (unlike most other fictions). You will find yourself thinking you want to read just one chapter, then wind up going through three or four before you get back to real life. This was the first book I have read by A. American, and I am now a fan. I never give a writer a second chance. If they impress me with the first book that I read by them, I will tell friends they are a great writer. If I'm not impressed, I slam their work with every thing I got, and never buy their stuff again. A. American goes into the great writer list. I love the fact that he will allow you to become comfortable with a character, then kill them off. Life isn't fair, so why should a story be? Why should the \"hero\" come out on top? A.A. lets you imagine a very realistic world, where he who has the bullets, and the will to use them decide what the rules are. I don't like that because of works like this, more people may start prepping. The fewer survivors after 2016-2020 the better, in my opinion. But as I stated, for those of you who weren't smart enough to do at least one term of service in the Army or Marines, you can get good ideas for gear. He names many items that you can research or purchase, just remember, in a bug-out event, you have to carry all your toys and ammo is a lot heavier than most civilians know. All in all.... read this book if you haven't already, because the world he describes is coming.

Starts out with him on the Interstate when his car dies as well as his cell phone.  He soon realizes what has happened as he sees more and more people stranded on the Interstate.  In this story the biggest difference from others I have read is this guy Morgan is prepared and has his pack stocked & with him.  Soon Morgan is hiking home and at first everything is relatively peaceful.  It doesn't take long before people figure out the electricity and most vehicles are never going to work again and all He*l breaks loose.  Morgan is soon thrust into a situation where he has to defend himself with his pistol and runs for his life. Soon Morgan meets a girl at a rest stop, Jess and she joins him on his walk.  They soon meet Thad and the trio is on the road together finding their way to their homes.  It doesn't take long before the trio opts to help what seems to be a husband, wife and two small children but turns out it's a ruse.  Not going to ruin the story for ya so all I will say is it gets exciting really quick!  Morgan is injured along the way and soon the trio are introduced to another character, Sarge.  Sarge is well prepared and as Morgan heals from his wound at Sarge's place other events take place in the country from the federal government.  Not sure yet but it looks like there may be some nefarious motives from the feds.  The story heats up pretty quickly as the trio go on their way to their individual homes with quite a bit of action along the way.  This book series is another great story written very well.

I would give this first book and the other 3 books I have completed 4 stars, but I want to express my disappointment with two of protagonist's (and possibly the author's) inaccurate beliefs.  First, these books take a excessively dim view of contemporary Americans.  It's as if there are very, very few independent, thoughtful, capable, decent people who would respond honorably to such a terrible event.  Good news folks: we're not a nation of helpless, nasty sheep.  Second, and this may be a related point, how is it that no one in these books (indeed in the whole post-apocalypse genre) is religious?!  Last I checked, if you find a group of honorable, brave Americans, including military, quite a few of them are going to be proud believers and given to sharing a prayer of gratitude now and again.  We get it - not everybody is a believer including some people whose behavior is impeccable.  And we understand not wanting to turn a book such as this into one all about God and faith.  But choosing to identify so many (good) characters in an offhand manner as \"not religious,\" yet having no one who is religious, is probably the result of simple common bias.  If and when the SHTF, people of faith will come together to make a powerful positive difference.

However, A. American really makes it seem plausible. The \"believability\" increases in the second book, but the first one is a very good one to start the journey on. Using Forchten's \"One Second After\" as the gold standard of these types of books, Going Home holds up and compares very closely to this benchmark. The characters are believable and reasonably well-developed. While there are a few grammatical errors, I found them not blatant (as they ARE in many self-produced books of this genre), and I was able to smoothly move through the story without getting hung up on them.

Just read Alas Babylon, a classic. Going Home is from the survivalist niche of the genre, which tends to express a worldview laced with fear and paranoia, with a strong antigovernment prejudice. If that's what you are looking for and literature is not really your thing, go for this book. I give this a 1 just because AA can tell a story, but he sure can't write it. Acronyms so dominate the narrative that it makes for a very choppy read (there is a glossary). But there is no excuse for all the errors! Others have pointed out the grammatical and spelling errors, the ridiculous inconsistency in tense and point of view. I mean, do us all a favor; if you are going to publish something, proofread it or have someone do it for you. There are also a lot of tired stereotypes crowding the action and character makeup. Sure, elements of the storyline are entirely feasible, but that's just not enough.
