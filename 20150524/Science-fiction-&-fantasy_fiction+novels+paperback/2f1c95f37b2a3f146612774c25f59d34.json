Lots of continuity errors and too much rehashing of exactly what everybody looks like, too much tell and not enough show, no story, no plot, just random bits of info dumping at strategic places that tries to disguise itself as a plot.

Apparently she was not satisfied with ruining The Anita Blake character and series her last 2 books of the Merry Gentry series accomplishes boredom, repetition of old information to fill pages, the destruction of main characters images, killing a main character that was both exciting and well loved by the few fans she had left. This book was my last hope for this author and it failed miserably. Laurell K. Hamilton is single handedly killing her own career and dragging her agent, editors and publishing house along with her since they are also responsible for publishing such trite. I was a real fan of Anita Blake as well as Merry Gentry Novels and was fully invested in all the many characters of this once wonderful and of fictional literature that I feel opened so many doors to the urban paranormal and fantasy genres. The heroines and heroes were both heroic and worth admiring and loving. The romance was lovely and had a wow factor now and for a long time all this authors work is about pain and depravity. This is surely a very public and published meltdown!  Funny that this book has therapy for so many of the abused characters hopefully the author is taking her own advice from her books. Meanwhile it saddens me to see the ruination of Anita Blake, Merry Gentry and all the many characters that became so real and loved by so many of us readers. I know that is why I bought this book and why I believe so many of us continued to stick by this author until I read this book that is. This is the end for me the decimation of Doyle's and Frost's characters in the same way in which she had done with almost all the male characters of Anita Blake's finally convinced me to be done with this authors work completely. The killing of one of my favorite characters that showed so much more promise of action, excitement and romance and sentiment was unforgivable!!!

The few major plot events that happen occur \"off screen\" or are treated only shallowly.

Magical facts established in earlier books (i.e., that Merry isn't really mortal anymore; that the Goddess won't be blessing the fey who don't appreciate her) are completely ignored.

No such luck. LKH has been getting less and less satisfying for the longest time.

At least the Merry Gentry series had a good reason for the sex. But this book was 65% descriptions, 20% sex, 10% flashbacks and 5% story. I had high hopes for this book since so many interesting things were supposed to happen. Taranis dethroned, Andais faced down, and the children finally appear.But all of those things were barely a facet of the story. Taranis, the big bad of the story apparently fades quietly offstage just because his hand is hurt, rather than fighting for  the throne he has held for THOUSANDS of years. Andais is suicidal but \"snaps out of her insanity\" when Meredith doesn't kill her, because that happens.  The children are ridiculously powerful already of course, though the only boy is less powerful than his sisters as any neofeminist supernatural erotic story must have it. Basically, i'm disappointed. But i'm especially disappointed with how Sholto dies. A single shot that he never even sees, and no mention of bringing him back is made. Even though the whole resurrection thing has happened for others already. Is it because Merry is only Queen because he is King and now she gets to have a crown to rule on her own? Is it because he's no longer interesting at all since his neutering was made complete? Whatever the reason for that or any of this disappointing book, i'm done with this series.

(Anyone remember how annoying Bittersweet was?)  This is the downside of committing yourself to a series.  You stick with it faithfully for YEARS and invest sometimes hundreds of dollars just to be sorely let down in the end by an author who clearly doesn't care about the characters any longer.  I'd rather not have had the last installment as to have endured listening to almost 13 hours of plot-less fluff.", "Helpfulness": 0.9166666666666666, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1CQBSCXD2I8OL"}}, {"Date": "on August 7, 2014", "Text": "This was a crushing follow up.

All that hair and clothes styling has got to take a large chunk of their day.  If I seem to be obsessing about the hair myself, it's because nothing much else really happens in this book until the very end(minor spoiler) when a major character is killed stupidly, and the main conflict is resolved(sort of) in a dream scene (almost identical to an earlier dream scene in this book), but THIS time it actually works.

This is the biggest let down ever after 5 years of waiting. I'm asking for my money back, I payed $26.00 .... It was all an illusion fabricated by a now commercialized writer.

We had to wait an eon for the latest Merry Gentry novel by Laurell K. Hamilton, but it was well-worth it! A Sliver of Light opens as Princess Merry has survived an abduction and rape by her Uncle (who\u2019s proven to be a match for her Aunt, Queen of the Unseelie, Andais on the whacko scale), and her pregnancy is advanced as she waits with her lovers \u2013 men she loves, and the special ones she is IN love with. They are all anxious for the twins arrival as no one yet knows who the fathers are. But there are innumerable surprises in store, not least of which is Merry\u2019s introduction to motherhood and the reactions of her cadre of guardians and lovers to the babes. But the horrors of the past have not been lain to rest. While she has given up her detective work due to her pregnancy (and she\u2019s given up sex too, which ain\u2019t easy when you\u2019ve got a line of lovers extraordinaire up close and personal on a daily basis), the mysteries of faerie continue to keep her landscape shifting. The blessings of the Goddess, witnessed in showers of rose petals, have touched many in her life, including some of her guards, and her friend in fae, Maeve, a Hollywood queen. This uncertainty, coupled with the new mysteries, have everyone a bit off balance. Then the trouble really starts. Genetic testing to prove who the fathers are will also keep her violent and insane Uncle at bay, too. Because Merry was already pregnant when he raped her. So he couldn\u2019t be the father. Could he? And her torture-loving Aunt Andais wants a home visit with the babies but everyone\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll lose control \u2013 it\u2019s happened before and everyone knows they\u2019ll rue the day it happens again. And while they wait to see the ongoing magickal developments in the babies \u2013 which might prove far more challenging than anyone would have thought \u2013 danger is getting closer. But who is their foe? As the men Merry loves are allowed back into her bed, there\u2019s darkness close at hand. The police are trying to help. The paparazzi are desperate for pix of the first fairy babes born in America since Merry herself. And someone is closing in on Merry and her mixed band of warriors. When the battle comes, someone may not make it out alive. This is Hamilton at her very best. Supremely hot and sexy, sensual, dark and gritty, romantic, thrilling, and Sliver is a story filled with the love, compassion, loyalty and heartbreak that has been a staple in this masterfully constructed world of Princess Merry and the Seelie and Unseelie courts. If you\u2019d despaired of more of Merry? The wait is over and you shall rejoice \u2013 as soon as you\u2019ve grabbed a copy and locked yourself away. Because you\u2019ll read this fast-paced paranormal in one sitting.
