The first book had the title Fatherless. It was also a great book. I am waiting for the third one in the series. This series is about the not too distant future. 2042. It is about the demographic changes that may occur due to society changing. The implication is that marriage is not important anymore and that our elderly population has outgrown the young population. There are not enough jobs to go around and life is not as easy as it once was. It is a time of selfishness. Women are more interested in their careers than in childbirth. It is a time when there are transition centers where the elderly or disabled may go and transition (die) so that their worldly goods may be given to their loved ones. There is a lot of abuse in this. I don't know, you will have to read it and come to your own conclusions. It is very close to that time now and I am not looking forward to that kind of future.
