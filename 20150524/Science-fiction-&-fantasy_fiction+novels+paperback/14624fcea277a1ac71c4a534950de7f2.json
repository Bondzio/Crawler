And after reading up on the author, was amamzed at the similarities between the author and the main character. I now certainly know what G. Michael Hopf would do! And one nice touch: some of the most evil people in this book are the most ordinary.(SPOILER) Usually you see the neo nazis or gang-bangers as the bad guys (The End has this too) but the most vile character in the book is the President of the Home Owners Association! That is certainly way too real!

I was disenchanted with the book by the time I reached about 25% of the way through, but kept reading - thinking something was going to happen that would discuss in some significance the breakdown of society because of the apocalyptic event. Instead, the greatest amount of true discussion about the restructuring of society seems to be with the main characters disputes with his neighborhood HOA president.  Then, the main character (whose background and personality traits are barely explored) makes extremely unlikable, violent decisions that even when considering the state of the new society still make no sense.  Meanwhile, the main character's wife seems to carry on in her daily life as if the destruction of society is no big deal with a perfectly melancholy attitude.  Lastly, the portrayal of the US Marines is unsettling to say the last.  The mutiny of the Marines, and eventual murdering of Marines by Marines is not only unbelievable but rather offensive, and basically helped me stop wasting my time as I deleted the book from my Kindle at the 61% mark.", "Helpfulness": 0.7647058823529411, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ATPO059B88SUI"}}, {"Date": "on April 16, 2013", "Text": "Well written.

I borrowed this book from library and start reading without checking any reviews. The dialogue between characters caught my attention right away and I kept asking myself why do I feel weird about this novel? I rechecked some of the dialogue and they are like elementary dialogue. Similar to he said, she said all the time. I feel like I was in fifth grade reading again. Also the main character and his family acted weird... too much hugging, kissing, and honey honey all the time. Then the main character acted like he didn't care about anyone else period. His perfect family is too unbelievable and no remorse what's so ever about any one else who would not benefit him or his family. Too weird and too selfish.

Its a shame as I would like to be able to trust them, but for a book this badly written to have a 4 star average over 600 reviews is crazy.  There are so many implausible things in this book that at some you stop reading it with real interest and, for me, continue reading just to see how massive a pile-up this train wreck will become.

I did, however, read the sample that Amazon lets you download prior to purchasing the book.  I have to say that early on in the story I was turned off the the fact that national news that the protagonist and his family chose to listen to (Fox News) and the commentator (0'Reilly) interviewing the speaker of the house and liberal congressperson turned me off to begin with.  Then, when the protagonist commented to his brother's query that he had be out purchasing new military style guns to add to his arsenal, I couldn't help thinking that his is not the book for me.
