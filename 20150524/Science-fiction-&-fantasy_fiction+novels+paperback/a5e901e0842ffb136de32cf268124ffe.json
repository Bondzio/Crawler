I love his work and I've read many others... I have to say Galapagos is one of my favorites.  On the surface, the unconventional style is great.  It's told from a million years in the future, with events revealed in non-cronological order.  This nonlinear storytelling really drives home Vonnegut's philosophies about the meaninglessness of time (as in Slaughterhouse Five and Sirens of Titan, for example).  Also, the grandiose nature of his plot is great.  The end of the world and the human race as we know it... typical Vonnegut, but still good stuff.  Above all, this book is very funny.  As in his other books, he treats such serious matters as war and death lightly.  This underlying irony is very present in Galapagos.  However, Galapagos is by no means a \"light\" book.  The subtlest twinge of sadness peeks through all of the humor -- just enough sadness to leave an impact.  On another level, Galapagos is great for its concept.  The human race is only screwing itself over, and it's about time it starts going backwards again.  The pessimism of it all is delightful, yet rings true.  My one gripe with Galapagos is its weak character development.  In a way this is OK, as it reinforces the message of the human race as a lost cause.  However, it would have been nice to have someone, anyone, to sympathize with.  But in the end Galapagos is interesting, funny, unconventional, and just a great read.", "Helpfulness": 0.9565217391304348, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3PB67T9V6WXDI"}}, {"Date": "on July 7, 2006", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2VJQG3OELAQ4E"}}, {"Date": "on February 20, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8723404255319149, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AL9HZLZT4X1KL"}}, {"Date": "on April 8, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1CYRTQ04LYI55"}}, {"Date": "on August 10, 2004", "Text": "GALAPAGOS is a profoundly moving and funny novel set in the reckless times of Ronald Reagan, when America itself seemed to be deevolving.

I guess everyone's standards for Vonnegut are so high they can't just read one of his lighter novels and enjoy it.  Merited many of his books are light but riddled with unbelievable and beautiful ideas, this book has value.  Spoiler*:  By the way, the narrator is Vonnegut's son, if people didn't catch that.  Also, he leaves characters undeveloped in this novel for a reason.  They are unimportant to the overall idea of the story.  Many books lack character development to help highlight other aspects of the work.  Other novels are strictly character driven for a reason.  Hemingway, Faulkner, Nabokov; their stories are driven by their characters experiences.  In Galapagos the characters are to be viewed on the smallest of scales since he is discussing evolution of a society and the mind.  This doesn't mean the book is not worth reading, Tom Robbins \"Villa Incognito\" is written in similar fashion.  It may not have the depth of meaning that his other books have or his beautiful rants that come right back around to the story.  It is short and sweet and to the point, the story is what drives the characters.  This makes Villa one of Robbins most enjoyable novels, where some of his others are bogged down in the development of characters.  They are tiny devices to convey a much larger message, and this is how Galapagos is written.  It is far more personal and reflects where Vonnegut was in his life.  Talking about the evolution of his writing, his \"big brain\" getting in the way.  It discusses his nature and his desires.  In Cat's Cradle he poured his soul on the page, but how can a person do that more than once?  No single individual has that much to offer.  Read Galapagos and just enjoy the storytelling and the ideas (and the *).  I gave four stars because I do agree this is one of his worst foreshadowing efforts.  It still beats 98% of authors at the time though.  I have read all of Vonnegut's work, and am also an English major.  Just saying I enjoy literature and I don't read garbage.  If you are just starting to read Vonnegut read Cat's Cradle, Siren's of Titan, or Slaughter-House 5.  Those are his most praised, but Mother Night is just as good.  Vonnegut had a style all his own, just enjoy reading an original and creative author, because there aren't a lot of them left.  He was one of the last great modern authors, R.I.P.

Kurt Vonnegut, however, has done much better.  It's tough to tell exactly where Galapagos is going from the beginning of the book, and the majority of the story after that is a gradual process of building up to a climax that never appears.  Galapagos works well as a caustic satire of civilization and all the supposedly beneficial products of our ridiculously large brains.  But I couldn't help feeling that there should have been something more here.  The characters themselves are interesting and Vonnegut's gleeful dissection of their destinies (death, for most) and the evolutionary consequences of them presents a picture of the personal aspects of Darwinism.  The ending was extremely unsatisfying and it just left me utterly depressed.  Vonnegut's future for the human race saddened me more than I had expected, even when I viewed the book as a satire.  Make no mistake, this book is extremely pessimistic.  Even from the detached viewpoint of the narrator, one can't help but sympathize with the characters, merely pawns in the evolutionary game.  And very few of the characters have any redeeming qualities at all.  Perhaps this was Vonnegut's aim with this book, but I couldn't help but a feel a sense of terrible loss, and I didn't at all find his new human race brave or admirable.  Galapagos, I suppose, will mean vastly different things for different people.  For me, it was a reminder that civilization does have many benefits, and that if it would perish, I would mourn it.

This is also a great one for someone new to Vonnegut", "Helpfulness": 0.5, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on December 19, 1997", "Text": "Kurt Vonnegut wrote the book Galapagos in the year1986 as a satire of the human race, making many contentions about what is wrong with it and showing some of these effects.  He presents a new society of humans which will result from a million years of evolutionary change due to an isolation of our species in the Galapagos islands and a near extinction of all humans.  Vonnegut's work is a satire in which he shows what he thinks is wrong with the human race.  He is trying to show how many of the actions humans take are unneccesarily created by what he considers our oversized brains.  Among Vonnegut's focuses are love, war, murder, death in general, and insanity.  He believes that everything about our society has become sick and over-complicated.  He tells the reader that \"This was a very innocent planet, except for those great big brains.\" (pp. 9) Throughout the book, he shows how each of the above problems in our world are things that happen to humans only because of ideas that their big brains give them.  For instance, he presents a man who has made a career out of making women think they are in love with him, and then running off with their money.  If it weren't for love, these women would have never had this problem.  Vonnegut contends that love is an illusion created by our big brains, which may be true.  However, in Vonnegut's new and improved human race which has much smaller brains, love does not exist, and mating is only for reproductive purposes.  He is very wrong in saying that people would be better for this, because although love brings problems, it also brings a lot of good things.  Vonnegut's new human race spends all its time fishing for food and basking in the sun.  He rids of every problem humans have today through evolution, which makes people almost like fish.  They are able to stay underwater for extended periods of time before coming up.  He also creates humans who have sense of individuality.  All people look alike, and since people have small brains and no need for relationships of any kind, it doesn't matter that people can't even tell each other apart.  They have no sense of history, or of who they are.  Vonnegut does not seem to think that these are things that humans need.  Vonnegut's story is believable, and could very well happen.  It involves ten people who are stranded on the island of Santa Rosalia and never found.  At the same time, a bacteria on the mainland begins eating human ovaries, so that no more humans are born, and the race as we know it becomes extinct.  The ten people on the island begin to reproduce, and evolve through time to eventually become what Vonnegut believes is the ideal society one million years from now.  Humans are isolated to islands forever, because their small brains restrict them from building any type of boats, and even if they were able to swim to South America, they would get the bacteria and be unable to reproduce.  This book definately helped me to understand man's origins.  In a way, it was the opposite of learning history which is supposed to help us understand human nature and to learn from that and not make the same mistakes again.  It is taking a story from the future and using it to understand the past.  Vonnegut's tales from Santa Rosalia, which are mixed in cleverly throughout his buildup towards the ship's departure, make me wonder if human life began the same way.  His story centers around an older man and woman who are on the island along with six young girls.  It could be that such a situation happened with Adam and Eve, who could have had six daughters before Eve became unable to reproduce, then when the girls became old enough, Adam inseminated them.  I don't know the real history since I've never read the bible, not that I think that would have anything to do with how it really began.  Another reason it could be similar to the beginning of humankind is that communication was strained because the older people, who spoke English, could not understand the Kanka-Bono language spoken by the young girls.  The first humans on our planet presumably did not yet have a language to speak, and had to develop their own methods of communication.  Also, I learned a lot from Vonnegut's narratives about how people's brains shrunk over time so that their heads could be more streamlined and they could swim better.  It involved Darwin's Law of Natural Selection, to which Vonnegut often referred.  It was interesting to put that law into modern-day terms.  It's interesting to hear to what humans may evolve rather than from what we have evolved.  The evolutionary ideas put forth by Vonnegut throughout the book are very interesting and informative.  However, what I don't agree with is Vonnegut's assertions that these evolutionary changes should happen.  It may be that the future human race which Vonnegut puts forth is merely an exaggeration of what he envisions, and that he uses evolution simply as a tool for change so that he does not have to spend too much time talking about how social changes will occur.  The point is that Vonnegut seems fed up with every part of human life and yearns for something much simpler.  I can agree with him only to the point that war, crime, deceit, and murder are behaviors which humans don't need to have.  However, I disagree with everything else.  I think that life needs to be complicated, because it gives people options.  We are allowed to live our life however we choose, and every person chooses differently.  People need to be able to think, to communicate, and to understand different things about themselves, others, and life.  We all need to be individuals.  Although I did not agree with many of Vonnegut's opinions, I must say that I enjoyed the book.  It is an interesting idea to think about, and Vonnegut presents the events in a very creative way.  Vonnegut's style of presenting ideas more than one time did get irritating at times.  For instance, he told the reader three or four times that in the future, humans will have short life spans due to killer sharks and whales.  Also, every time he refers to an action a person performs, he says it is due to their big brains, and states matter-of-factly that people in the future have no need for such a behavior because they are not capable of thinking and therefore performing the action.  Despite such annoyances, Vonnegut's style was funny and entertaining.  This book should be read as an introduction to any course on Sociology that is taken, and by anyone who is interested in people, society, and psychology.  Vonnegut has such intense ideas of what is wrong with humans and society, and these ideas should be given consideration.  They may not always be accurate, but they give quite a commentary on what is wrong with humans and what needs to change.", "Helpfulness": 0.5714285714285714, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2T145209TK6CH"}}, {"Date": "on April 5, 2015", "Text": "Read it cover to cover, it keeps you laughing and you can't put it down.

Vonnegut spent two thirds of the book wandering about aimlessly.  In the final third it's like he got sick of the  book and just wanted to finish it, so it suddenly feels rushed.  He makes a  few minor points along the way, but I never quite caught what he was  getting at. Also, while the lack of respect for time is an interesting  concept, do not foreshadow when you already tell me what happens.  It is  ineffective.  Style does not a good book make.

I found Vonnegut's work to be an incredibly difficult read.  He pays little attention to speed and character development, and his metaphors (I will bring up the \"when the rocket that french kissed the radar dish\" one) did not provide a clear image in my head as to what he had intended.  I did think that his ideas were largely valid and that he had interesting points, yet he seemed so antagonistic toward humans and made all of his characters unlikeable, with features that became exaggerated to the point of being unreal.  If you like abstract work of an unorthodox writing style, this book may not bother you, but otherwise I would not recommend it.  I ended the book feeling like I had wasted a great deal of time and learned nothing, on top of being frustrated with Vonnegut's writing style and characters.", "Helpfulness": 0.14285714285714285, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7U1MS3PS175X"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Galapagos-Novel-Fiction-Kurt-Vonnegut/product-reviews/0385333870/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "3.8 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$12.43", "Salesrank": "#17,464", "ListPrice": "$16.00"}
