Transformers were not destroyed. Satellite signals were not disconnected.

If, as suggested, there are as few as 30,000 people left in the U.S., they should not have to be living in gas stations and fast food restaurants for decades, without making any effort at re-establishing civilization.  Apparently, none of these survivors have ever heard of solar cells, wind power, or hydroelectric dams, and are thus resigned to living without electricity.  None of them have heard of electric vehicles with solar chargers, or cars that run on ethanol or biodiesel, so they are resigned to using horses as their primary mode of transportation. There are apparently no ham radio operators left among the living, so nobody makes any attempt at long-range communications using low-tech, low power radios, or even attempts short-range communications using battery-powered walkie-talkies from Radio Shack.  Nobody remembers how to man a sailboat, so there is no traffic up and down the nation's rivers, bringing trade goods and news.  Guns and ammunition are running low, despite the fact that at the time of the collapse there were about 300 million guns in the U.S., about ten thousand for every man, woman and child left alive after the plague. Prepared foods and medicines are unobtainable, despite the fact that 30,000 survivors wouldn't make much of dent in the supply of medicine on the shelves of the nation's 40,000 chain pharmacies, or in the supply of food in the nation's 40,0000 chain supermarkets (not to mention the thousands and thousands of independent pharmacies and grocery stores).

Novel is a blend of science fiction, adventure and romance, which was seamlessly written and beautifully narrated by ESJM. The story unfolds around a population decimating epidemic, giving equal time to the months before the pandemic, the event, and the aftermath, but cleverly jumping between the three instead of using a chronological format to relate the story. Often the use of this type of storytelling is confusing at first, sometimes to the point the reader gives up. Recently I read a young adult novel called \"Code Name Verity\", which had won numerous prestigious awards, was highly thought of, came with rave reviews, and try as I might, I could not get past Chapter 3, it was so confusing in the way it jumped back and forth between locations, characters, years, countries, I gave up (I went back to it later after having read an introduction and description of the novel and spent 5 hours reading it front to back, SUPER BOOK, IF YOU HAVENT READ IT, YOU SHOULD) . The way the story unfolds out-of-order in this novel is what makes the book a compelling and provocative read, written using current colloquial verbiage and terminology which immediately hooks the audience, with such familiarity it seems as if the story is taking place somewhere you've been, the people are like people you know, the surroundings and landmarks are familiar, but the tale being told is like nothing you can imagine, a glimpse of a shocking brutal future.

From the bleak-but-hopeful (The Passage), to the really bleak with a drop of hope (The Road) to the uber-bleak (1984). Along this spectrum of emotional tones, Mandel's work arguably sits on the more hopeful end. I found this hope to be refreshing, without being pollyannish (if such a label could ever appropriately be given to a novel in which 99% of the world is wiped out, and roving bands of criminals and murderous cults play a role). Indeed, I was struck by the richness of the narrative, and by the effectiveness of the Lost-like flash-back-flash-forward technique used to flesh out the characters, and to draw attention to different facets of the human experience. While there were some narratives that tied up just a little too well for my tastes, overall these aren't enough to dissuade me from really loving the novel itself. I found myself constantly coming back to the book, as much for its plot as for its reflections on how we remember events, and how much of our adulthood is spent re-examining and trying to adequately narrate the flecks of memory that linger with us from our childhoods.

I'm certain the book adds an additional resonance in this current day of ebola hysteria, building momentum with every passing hour, but I found myself constantly wondering what if something like this Georgia flu in the story really happened? How would the world and it's survivors fare in a before/after scenario.

While I applaud St. John Mandel for taking a tiring theme and breathing into it fresh perspective, I cannot say that the ground she treads here is riveting or inspired. The novel has a present, past, present variability that is easy to follow and a cast of characters that seem random, but Mandel pulls together with precision and aplomb that would disgrace many of her peers. Station Eleven doesn't have a central character, nor does it have a specific direction. About halfway through the book, I stopped reading and evaluated how entertained I was and to what degree the book's plot had actually achieved anything. The answer to both was very little. While the second half of the book is better, it never reaches the heights I'd hoped for. It ties up threads nicely, but it also becomes liberal and preachy in a way that is off putting. I found that I cared very little about any of the characters. By the end, perhaps only Kristen had any relevance for me, and that only in the way of her grit and determination that seemed to overshadow many of her fellow cast mates. Add in contrivances that are silly in retrospect, and the disappointment deepens. Why would people live in Wendy's and McDonald's and airplanes? 99.9% of the population is gone. There are plenty of houses available. Same goes for ammunition shortages. With essentially 100% of the populace dead, there'd be more ammo than the survivors could ever use. Throw in a shameless religious attack with an antagonist labeled as \"The Prophet\" (kid you not, yep, The Prophet), and you've got tropes that drag this wildly benign story to depths that Dr. Eleven wouldn't have been able to reach. I guess in the end, I was largely unmoved.

(One of the primary conflicts is between the \"prophet,\" who preaches that everything happens for a reason, and most survivors, who know it was just a mutated virus and only luck separates the living from the dead.)  The book's strongest metaphor is the Orchestra which travels between  survivor outposts and plays Shakespeare and music.  I hadn't thought about how Shakespeare's life and plays were shadowed by the plague, which restricted travel in Elizabethan times and banished theater to the countryside. The book is nowhere near as harrowing as \"The Road,\" where I was often scared to turn the page, but the details of deprivation and improvisation, and the nostalgia for our present,  are similarly fascinating. I like that the book revolves around an unpublished graphic novel, and that its motto isn't from Shakespeare but from Star Trek.

So I approached \"Station Eleven\" with healthy skepticism. But Emily St. John Mandel's book is the real deal.  When I write reviews, I tend not to summarize plots.  The Library Journal did so very nicely in one or two sentences.  Suffice it to say that the novel is about a post-apocalyptic world, a world decimated by an incurable virus. In this world the things we take for granted no longer exist: electricity, gasoline, communication.  But in Mandel's book we do not experience the apocalypse through the eyes of roving marauders or the hero - \"The Road Warrior\" (movie) - trying to survive despite them. Nor do we see the world through the nihilistic eyes of a dying father trying to save his son - \"The Road\" (novel).  Instead, we are provided a troupe of actors and musicians, a paparazzo-turned-EMT, and a boy who grows up to become the leader of a band of religious survivalists - echoes of \"Lost\" (TV show). Time is fluid and characters connected in surprising but believable ways.  The only reason I did not go all out with 5 stars is that the pacing is a bit slow and at times the book tries too hard to be plotted like a movie or TV show with chapter-ending cliff-hangers.

If you're hoping for survivalist adventure this may not be what you're looking for, but if you're looking for finely written and crafted characters whose lives happen to intersect around the time of the end of the world as we know it, I strongly recommend it.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A23WRE5K45FA4B"}}, {"Date": "on April 23, 2015", "Text": "\"Spanning decades, moving back and forth in time\" is exactly what this book does.
