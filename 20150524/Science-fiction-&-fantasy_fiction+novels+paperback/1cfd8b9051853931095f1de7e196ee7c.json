                "Text": "This ebook was fantastic and totally different from any other sci-fi thriller I've ever read. Very original story. I love that some of it was written like a diary then brought you to the present. Without spoilers I must say that this is the first book that instead of making me afraid of the dark it made me afraid to be living. I kept thinking, \"what if.... what if .....\". I kept feeling like maybe a hole in the ground somewhere might make me feel safe. I liked that the main character Andy was so human. Who couldn't relate to someone in that extreme situation. The author pushed this character from feeling special to feeling cursed. You  didn't want to be him after a while. Because I've read so much sci-fi, I personally could predict what the next move might be but you are never sure until it happens. It was a wild ride. Glad I have a strong heart."

I found myself easily hooked into the book and constantly questioning, \"why, what's next, how??\" In my opinion, the author wasted no time getting right into the thick of the story and from there he kept up the action pretty well! There seems to be some concern with pretty minor grammar/spelling issues, in the reviews. I found that these were easily overlooked as the story telling was excellent! I think there is plenty enough information in the story summary to help you decide if you're interested in reading and some of these reviews attempt to ruin a surprise ending. :( I'm glad I didn't read any reviews before I read the book.. as I was pleasantly surprised by the ending. I will definitely be choosing another book by this author as my next read."

It had possibly the least likeable protagonist of anything I've read in the last 10 years. The inner monologue of Andy just goes on and on and on and on, oh and then on some more with no actual insight or original thought. The author describes a scene or emotion one time then does so again and again as though it is giving the reader some deeper meaning to what his character is supposed to feeling when it is really just nauseating. We get it, he's confused by what's happening don't need to have it broken down for us over and over. If this book is supposed to be a \"thriller\" or \"horror\" the people who put it that category must have found The Bridges of Madison County to be one of the most edge of your seats capers of the last century. Pure B.S.  As much as the ASOIAF series has made me love reading once again and led me to becoming a fan of many more authors and genres, this book made me lose faith in the Amazon recommendations and made me question whether or not to take chances on lesser known authors like Smitherd with my money.  Smitherd and Amazon we are all dumber for having read this book, I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul."

It took me a while to even get that far through it, despite reading it in an airport where there's nothing else to do.

Kept thinking--put the targets on a ship and lead the stone man through the oceans (walking across ocean floor) forever--until end of targets' natural lifespans. Then, do it again for the next visit.  However, author put- an -end to that strategy by putting a small-area barrier around each target.  Finally the ending strategy fell in line with the obvious solution, so I was no longer frustrated!  Exciting!  Looking forward to next book I will read by him.  His easy, natural conversational style among the protagonists, made reading this book very fluid and enjoyable.  He deserves to be picked up by a major publisher and movie producers!! Only, please drop the F word, which I know is pervasive among people, today.  There do not seem to be any other offensive words, though bollocks ( I had to look up), is offensive to Brits, I didn't know what it meant-literally. Characters do reflect, unfortunately, the selfishness prevalent in so many."

Couldn't put the book down and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the well-developed characters.  I thought it was a unique story and it had a few nice twists to the plot.  Since then, I just finished the first part of the Black Room and enjoyed that as well.  I guess I am now a full-fledged 'Smithereen'."

So naturally I kept tapping the next page button as quickly as I could. Mr. Smitherd is, I think, a natural storyteller. The main characters are very well-drawn and their actions quite reasonable and believable. For Mr. Smitherd (if you're reading): I especially liked the Brigadier. Very sharp. Very professional. And compassionate when allowed. Also for Mr. Smitherd (if you're reading and since you asked), the only real issue I had with the military aspect was, when you finish transmitting on a radio you say \"over\". When you're completely finished with the radio conversation, you say \"out\". Saying \"over and out\" isn't correct. I hate to be picky but you did ask! I'll be looking for more books from Mr. Smitherd. I think he has a natural talent and quite simply, I haven't read such a fresh sci-fi-thriller-horror story in a long, long time."

Although this book has no Horror as we think of it today, it has plenty of emotional horror, great Sci-F and solid characters.  I am perplexed by some of the reviews I read prior to purchase with qualms like:  there wasn't an ending and/or explanation (yes, there were and both were quite good - unsettling but good), there were typos (admittedly a pet peeve of mine for dinging a book review, but really - this book had very few) and that it was slow to start (huh?).  This last point I really don't understand because personally, I appreciate the time to get to know the protagonist -- it makes me actually care what happens to him/her when chaos begins!  Whereas I can appreciate a book that starts with chaos and then you learn something about the characters, it's just not the same.  This book did not take too long to get the action started but did give you time to care (and I thought I was impatient!).  Anyway, if you are looking for a great original Sci-fi book to lose yourself in for a few hours, you can't go wrong with The Stone Man."

In general it's very well written and kept me wanting more and more. The characters are flawed and at first I didn't really like the main one. There are a couple of parts that I didn't feel belonged in the book and felt awkward (sleeping with another mans wife just didn't do anything for the story and felt 'slotted in'). However the whole premise is so clever that you end up overlooking this. Great story, very realistic and I want to know more!"

Andy and Paul were great as albiet unwilling 'finders' of the Stone Men's prey.  Henry, victim 2, was both inspiring and heartbreaking in his terror and courage at his fate. Victim 3,Theresa (Spoiler Alert) smothrred her own baby to save her froma fate she wasnt sure of but knew would be terrible. Who could blame her for stabbing  the solders who were coming to hand her over to such a fate? Wouldnt you? i certainly would!  SPOILER ALERT!! When Andy and Paul became frightened and paranoid thereafter and realized THEY had been 'chosen' they knew what their fate would be.  The differeces in their manner of dealing with it was inspired!  As for typos, the only thing that stood out for me was the use of 'floors' whether you were indoors or out, but was so consistent i decided perhaps the author is from an area that uses that terminolgy.  it certainly doesnt detract from his great imagination!  i sure hope there's a sequel."

I agree with you that sometimes you need to let the reader fill in the gaps and actually \"think\" the story through. For me it all flowed. Loved your characters. I am an animal lover and enjoyed your animal portraits with all its surprising twists! Your story was refeshingly original. I was never bored. Love your frankness at the end, explaining to your readers where you are at, the importance of reviews, etc. Its great some Kindle readers get a free book, but hey, its your bread and butter. READERS take a minute as a thank you and review. Im not your editor so, as long as I can read it, a few minor errors is not going to rock my boat LOL! By the way I think whenever a writer chooses the topic of the after life, and it dosent fit with the readers idea of what that is, there will be negatives. But peeps, its a story! Right? You have gained a new fan, keep up the good work! Best of luck to you! Cheers!"

And I'm not talking about the good magic, this is the \"defies the laws of physics as we know\" type magic, which usually means an author reached a dead end and whipped out this explanation to get him out. Later, things slowed down, and alien #2 hits. (None of this is a spoiler, as Mr. Smitherd drops hints like a horse drops ... you get the picture.)  I fall asleep on the plane, reading. The story telling gets more ponderous. I fall asleep on the couch, reading. The plot wanders and the author gets to pretend he is rich and successful. I fell asleep in bed, reading.Then the end hits and ... wait, that was no ending, just a story whose batteries have run out. So read the first third, put it down, and consider yourself lucky."

Well, yes, actually, quite a bit. The plot is intriguing, the writing good, the storytelling brisk and, contrary to a few reviews, it is the characters exposition that makes the story compelling. However, I must admit to a nagging disatisfaction at the end. Perhaps it was the rather ambiguous ending, though that usually doesn't bother me. Rather, I think I was intrigued by Paul and, especially, Brigadier Straub. There were hints that there was much hidden by that professional facade. There was a lot more to Paul, too, I think, that might have explained better explained his visceral reaction to certain events. Perhaps a sequel is in order?"

Some, but not all, of the mystery is solved by the end. I generally read hard Science Fiction, with excursions into dystopian fiction and fantasy;..but this caught my attention and kept it. I actually want to read more by this author now, which is the highest compliment I can pay. I liked his storytelling style. I wouldn't say it is my new favorite book. But I liked it a lot and thought the idea was so interesting....and scary. There were a lot of typos in the edit that I purchased. I don't know if there is a version that has been edited since, but that was a bit bothersome."

I read the whole story and appreciated the relationship between the two main characters' odd friendship. The depiction of their personalities was probably the most interesting and moving aspect to me. After it all, I still am not really able to put all the pieces together as a whole story.

You are \"with\" Andy as he comes to understand that he has some strange connection with the Stone Man.  Could this be the story of his career, or the end of his life?  You also have an insider's view of the decisions the military makes in its efforts to deal with the alien menace, and how the main characters become part of the military's efforts.  This adds an element of realism that is lacking in other sci fi novels.  Highly recommended."

The British tone of voice is also fun to read. The main character is a writer and he tends ramble on and on at times - I felt like I was wading through during these parts. The end was intriguing but ultimately a bit unsatisfying. The alternative ending (look for it) felt better to me. Don't get me wrong, I was drawn back to the book every time I put it down."

I thought the 'stream of consciousness' style would be annoying, but it turned out it was anything but.  Very good character development, and the only thing I anticipated was your final solution!  Keep writing!  I started your excerpt of 'The Black Room', and I like it already.  Thanks"

With chillingly realistic perspectives, the story of two men caught in life changing events beyond their control is scary, fascinating and honest.  There is no pretense in these characters, (or this story): no maudlin appeals to 'man kinds better nature'; no false heroics.  When faced with the simplest and most frightening events in their lives, these characters react exactly as you and I would---with fear, humor, desperation and indecisiveness.  It is exactly this honesty in writing that makes this story so appealling.  I couldn't put the damn thing down.  Bravo."

Not like Godzilla terrorizing the locals, the motives of the Stone Man are absolutely mysterious.  Somehow the mystery never gets resolved.  I like the writing style though long-winded story telling, some chapters are too long and some are too short.  Unfortunately the author just cut it abruptly, then begged the reader to give it a star rating, with a slice of his book to be, and some sloppy alternative ending draft.  If he wants to get a higher star rating, he should finish the story properly.  Looks like his stuff is kind of surreal."

I'm in the US and I kept thinking that one or two would show up there.  Just imagine if one left England, went into the sea, and walked all the way across the ocean to America.  When it came on shore, total panic.  If only it could be led into the Mariana Trench, how would it get out of there?  The scenarios are endless.

This holds up well against the giants in Sci-Fi like Bradbury or Asimov. The story is intriguing in itself but I really like the way Smitherd handles the human side (slight pun off the story line) of the protagonist. He is a brave hero and a cowering scoundrel - sometimes in virtually the same moment. Most of all he reacts to fantastic circumstances with real human thoughts and emotions. There are also points in the story that he waxes philosophical amidst his wonderful / horrible journey that caused me to pause - like Neo atop the WTC - and just go \u201cWhoa!\u201d Many other reviewers have provided a synopsis of the story so I won\u2019t bother with that - only to say that the setting and descriptions of the actions and interactions make for a very realistic and believable tale. There were times I found my heart racing and my body tensed in anticipation of the next page, as well as times that I read much later into the night (and morning) than I planned - because I couldn\u2019t stop.

I'm not a writing critic by any stretch, I just read what I like and if it bores me I don't finish it.  I was interested till the end.  I really liked the characters and the way they interacted as well.  I didn't feel much of the \"thriller\" in it, but that didn't matter at all, I guess you could kind of feel the fear the characters were feeling.  I also found myself laughing quite a few times during some of the interactions between Andy and Paul.  Luke does a really good job telling the story from the main character's point of view, and you get a really clear visual of what you are reading, which for my attention span is very important.  I'm well into another book by Luke and enjoying that one as well.  Looking forward to more by him."

Very few spelling errors/misused words, and the writing was clear and engaging. I thought Paul's character was under-developed and switching to his POV at the end was a little jarring, and Andy's diagnosis of Asperger's seemed unrealistic and unnecessary. Given the unlikely nature of the precipitating event, the reactions of all involved seem very believable. Kudos to Mr. Smitherd for doing his research well! Bottom line, I recommend this book, I just don't think it's exceptional or something I will want to read again and again."

I found for me it was a metaphor for death. These terrifying impressive stone things landing and then slowly marching across the landscape, taking out and impervious to anything in their path they were just downright creepy. All the best scientific minds working round the clock to try and stop it, to try and understand it with with all their gadgets all to no avail. Some people are driven mad by it, some are rendered helpless by it, hiding away behind closed curtains. Some face it with dignity and want to face it with boots on and a lets get on with it courage. Others want to make deals with it want to try and bargain for more time. I'm sure I have it all wrong but that's what I took from it. A good solid story and I liked the ending."

Often, authors over-explain things that are best left to the reader's imagination. I will definitely read more by Luke Smitherd and look forward to seeing what else he'll come up with.  In summary, this is a great read that I definitely recommend to fans of thrillers and sci-fi alike."

It was worth the read, but I just couldn't really get into the story like some others. However, you're definitely unique - and I like that very much Luke Smitherd.  I am interested in your style and story lines, but it may take too much out of me if the story takes a long time to be up and running.

I did have a hard time at first with the English terms and phrases that we don't use here in U.S. but eventually found this interesting rather than frustrating. I really wanted to give the book a full 5 stars, but couldn't due to typos. Not a serious problem, but enough you have to read around them here an there. The end left me wanting more, but the more I thought about it, the more I think the ending was what worked best. I highly recommend reading The Stone Man."

It is the struggle and the reflection on what we do in the same position that makes this book such an interesting read. The author's style allows enough detail to imagine what's happening to unfold like a movie in your head but not be so overly descriptive that you lose out on the story events. My question- who could portray Strain on film. I did like her depiction as a strong female, a consummate professional."

As a reader from a very small town in the US it seems that I don't always immediately grasp some of the phrasing of a writer from across the pond but it wasn't such a gap that it interrupted my enjoyment of your book! Really sir you better get cracking ,I'm devouring book 4 of TBR and I find myself wanting to know how it ends, but not wanting it to end. If that makes any sense at all:)  Thank-you Mr Luke Smitherd,please keep writing so I can tell people that I read you before you were super rich and famous."

He grabs your interest early and keeps it with steady momentum all the way through. If I had an objection it would be that the book ends 88% through the pages. a full 10% of the books mass is a kind of self promotional statement that begs reviews. So believing that there was some twist or epilogue yet to come, instead the book ended rather suddenly. But that aside, Luke Smitherd wove a great tale and I encourage others who enjoy science fiction that is strong on the characters and merely uses sci-fi as the vehicle to read this book. It's a very decent work."

My solution to that problem was skimming over the material. I did read throughout to the somewhat anticlimactic finish( the author did provide a somewhat more satisfying alternate ending). The writing was okay, the main characters were fleshed out fairly well. I give it three stars because I really believe that this is a book which while fairly well written will not impress the serious science fiction fan very much."

The hilarity begins when he, as former newspaper reporter, attempts to interview the young dude who claims to have been the first in the crowd to witness the frightening materialization of the Stone Man. The exchanges of dialog and repartee between the reporter and the young Irish man along with the witness' scared behavior are really comical. The plot picks up speed from that point on, which compels the reader to not put the book down until the finish, trying to second guess how it all ends. The author (Smithered) also introduced a female Army general who's all business-like in taking charge of the chaotic situation arising when the Stone Man starts moving and creates death and destructions along his seemingly unstoppable path. I really enjoyed this sci-fi story."

In the event it hasn't been stated outright, this book is British, not American English.  That's not a problem at all (in fact it adds to the charm of the tale), but at first it kinda threw me.  This was a nice departure from a lot of what I've been reading lately, and I did enjoy the story. Wish it had a more interesting ending, but that happens sometimes. I liked so many of the characters, and the flow of the story from Andy's viewpoint. I have already downloaded 3 more books from this author, and will continue to look for more in the future.

The plot lays out an interesting twist on the old idea that you can't kill the boogeyman. it explores a bit of interesting ethical territory when we discover not only that boogeyman can't be killed, but that everyone else wants the boogeyman to get you.  Nicely done Luke, and I'll be on the lookout for more of your books."

Rarely do I come across a self-published novel of such quality. I've been reading classic sci-fi novels since childhood, especially enjoying the ones by famous authors of the past, like Heinlein and Bradbury, and I think Smitherd has the potential to be in their class. Although this novel includes more profanity than I'd prefer, the story itself was well worth the read - intriguing, somewhat chilling, and thoroughly entertaining. The main character rings true as a real person who grows and changes over the course of the events in the story. This one will stick with me. Well done, Mr Smitherd. Oh, and thanks for including the alternate ending - it gave me the sense of closure I needed."

This novel keenly holds your attention, as it keeps you guessing throughout.  His characters are very well drawn at the same time being quite personal to the reader.  I particularly enjoyed his seamless transition from Andy's first person/protagonist viewpoint to the third-person narrative of Paul's ultimate fate.  On the down side, good Si-Fi, as with any good mystery or thriller, demands a denouement, which among other things, provides some plausible explanation of the mystery.  Here, Mr. Smitherd fails to give us even an inkling as to why the super-human blue Stone Men needed living human brain-stem/spinal tissue to be created and/or function.  Are we to assume that the original Stone Man was also supplied with human tissue before the novel begins?  Paul's ultimate fate being left ambiguous is fine, but unanswered pivotal questions ultimately leave one disappointed rather than begging for more."

I am a fan for sure, and I have already left reviews for The Black Room parts one and two. A good story by a good storyteller and I am sure the stories will only get better. I couldn't give it five stars though, because of one thing that bugged me. The \"Asperger's\" character. Writing about characters with Aspergers has become an in thing, it seems and I would caution this author, and any other author, to avoid the temptation. I know that it seems like it just makes for an interesting character, but as someone whose son actually has been diagnosed with Asperger's, it always leaves me cold. Asperger's is a syndrome. They are not stock characters that you can develop off a list. Every Asperger's kid is different. For instance the \"no empathy\" is a stereotype. My son has hyper-empathy, for lack of a better way of putting it, and when stereotypes are created, it creates assumptions that create problems (as in schooling). You see I gave it 4 stars, so I wasn't deeply offended, just bugged. I'm a bit sick of all the Asperger's characters cropping up, is all. Despite this, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good and entertaining read."

I don't usually read sci-fiction, but this story had me from almost the beginning.  I liked that the main character was not always likable, but he was honest about his feelings and life.  Very good story that does make you wonder how you would react (morally?) in similar situations.  Also, makes you think that sure something like this happening is possible.  I will definitely be reading more of Luke Smitherd's work."

Like I stated in my last review, I am now a Smithereen. Next is The Physics of the Dead(TPOTD). Will have to hunt for another one after that. You won't regret reading this.

It took a little while for me to get into it but once I did it was hard to put down. I don't want to give anything away so I will just say that Andy surprised me at the end. I was glad the author published an alternate ending at the back of the book as I preferred that one. I've never been a big fan of the ambiguous ending. I will say the book could use a little editing but it doesn't take away from the story. All in all a good read and I would definitely read more from this author."

Though the plot seemed completely unplausible, the author made it work, and I found myself sinking deeper and deeper into the story. Overall, despite the crazy premise, it was well written and compelling. Though the term is overused, this, for me, was truly a page turner which I found hard to put down and also found myself thinking about when I wasn't reading it. Unlike some others, I thought the author ended it just right. Life often doesn't have clean, wrapped-up endings. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to not only science fiction lovers, but to anyone who is looking for a unique, exciting read--one that will leave you thinking about long after you read the last page."

This book was far better than most of what I've read in the last year and certainly good enough for me to recommend to my 30-year old son. I will be looking to download more books from this author, and encourage anyone who enjoys a well-told story to do the same, starting with this one."

I am a fan of sic-fi stories which take place in ordinary real life settings, with every day people who are suddenly thrown into extraordinary and mysterious situations.  Put it this way - I LOVE John Wyndham novels!  Reading the Stone Man was like discovering a John Wyndham book I hadn't read before. It had the same creepy, spine tingling feel which I love, especially when contrasted with the typically English setting and quintessentially English characters, and while I had some reservations about the ending, it was consistent with the storyline and entirely unpredictable. Highly recommended to lovers of classic sic fi novels."

                "Text": "What would happen if suddenly a gigantic stone man appeared and started smashing it's way across the country?  Who's mind even asks that kind of question?  Very cool.  The set-up for the story certainly gives the author a lot to work with.  The characters were well developed and believable.  The response of the military was realistic.  I don't think the press was well portrayed.  From what I've heard about the British tabloids they would have been a lot more aggressive but we'll let this one slide.  Still, a very realistic portrayal of a very unrealistic situation.  There was enough action to keep you interested but enough plot to give you something to think about after reading a chapter.  Sadly the story was simply too bleak for my taste.  Brave people going to their death for the greater good.  People being driven insane by an all-powerful, unstoppable superior force.  Be chased to death by an unstoppable creature.  I think the worst part of the story was the absolute sense of hopelessness.  Not that I need a hollywood ending every time.  I know not all stories end \"happy\".  But our characters should have SOME sense of hope.  If they are smart and brave they should be able to come up with something other than suicide as a solution.  The one character who finds a \"solution\" that allows him to live has it even worse than the ones who died.  The author presents an \"alternative\" ending - the original ending - in the final page of the book but explains that he abandoned that ending for one with more punch.  Seriously?  Oh well - he's the author and it's his story.  He can end it any way he likes.  For me, I think I'm going to print this one out, rip up the ending and paste back in the original.  Far better.  But as it is, this book was just not my cup of tea.  I wanted to give this book 1 star because I really didn't enjoy it at all.  I have to admit it's very well written and should probably get 5 stars.  There's no star system that says \"Great Book - Hated it\" so I settled for an unsatisfactory 3 stars.  Which really is a cop-out because it's not a mediocre book.  It's either great or terrible."

I agree with the reviewer who said that this could be a short story if they kept the extraneous stuff out.  I REALLY DO NOT NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU HAD SEX WITH SOMEONE'S WIFE.  It does nothing for the plot and makes me hate the protagonist.  The writing is forced - no one talks like that.  No one thinks like that.  The protagonist is an arrogant jerk.  All the characters have the same voice.  So much work needs to go into the editing."

At first, I hated that we never resolve more about the stone men, but the story is less about them than it is about Andy, and ultimately, Paul. The ending leaves it all open, so you finish in as much suspense as you were throughout the book. Luke Smitherd is now on my favorites authors list, both this and The Physics of the Dead are original, well told stories, and I'll be back for more by him! Definitely recommending this one."

And when it takes almost 6 pages for the main character to break through a door, you know your dealing with one bloated novel.  On the plus side, there were no spelling or other errors, and if the author could of kept from describing everything in the most minute detail, it would of been a good novel.

This is a perfectly stupid book written by a pasty limey with British phrases which sometimes went over my head and other times were easy enough to figure out.  Had I \"realised\" rather than \"realized\" it was British I am very sure I would not have spent the $0.99 for the terrific sounding book.  It was very slow to start.  I fell asleep, began again where the tablet turned off the night before and had to go back and re-read several pages and it still didn't make sense.  I LOVE science fiction but I think this is what happens to a young mind with the aid of alcohol.  Keep writing and perhaps find some better drugs to produce something more interesting."

I got an error message saying it didn't download properly.  No luck trying to re-download without paying for the priviledge.  So, I'll never know how the story ended because I refuse to pay for what I've already paid for....one free book a month as an Amazon Prime member.  Sure hope this doesn't happen again as I'm having trouble with the lending library at Amazon.  I'm afraid to even click on a book for information about it, or read a sample of it, these days.  Amazon quietly puts a charge for it on my credit card without my knowledge or permission!  No \"Thanks for your Purchase\" screen or any confirmation at all that they just put a charge on my card.  That's why I closed my credit card with them.  Why would I pay for a book I can read for free?  They've just a bit too free and easy with using my card.  No more."
