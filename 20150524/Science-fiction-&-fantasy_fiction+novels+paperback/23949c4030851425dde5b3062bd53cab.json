I admit I was a little worried because I felt let down by the way Rudith and Sarah's story ended and wasn't sure if a story with Runach could be pulled off at least not with him having no magic and messed up hands.  However somehow it works.  I was pulled in immediately as Lynn began her story with a memory and not the one at the well thank goodness.  I think it is the loneliness of Runach and Aisling that pulls at you the most.  It seems as though each is surrounded by people and yet very much alone and trapped in circumstances in which the have no control.  As the travel through the nine kingdoms they are thrown together as they each try to find a place in a world in which neither quite seem to belong.  Aisling is trying to escape the life she left behind in a weaver's guild and find a mercenary to free here people all while trying to figure out how much of what she has been told is a lie and how much is truth.  Runach is trying to find his place in the world without his magic and to relearn how to wield a sword with his nearly healed hands.  They encounter many of the characters from the previous nine kingdoms books...primarily those from the first three, some good and other boy.  The similarities between Aisling and Sarah become apparent early on to the reader and yet the is only a brief mention of Sarah in the book which seems odd considering what is revealed.  The only real downside is that unlike Miach and Rudith, Runach doesn't quite measure up as a hero able to take care of himself and Aisling.  Aisling manages to get him out of a few situations as do other familiar characters and unlike the other too it seems like he is incapable of doing more and clearly wishes he had his magic.  It leaves you thinking, hoping, and wondering if somehow he will manage to get his magic back....", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AUP85CG2NBNWN"}}, {"Date": "on January 31, 2013", "Text": "Even though this is the 7th book in a series, it does not disappoint.

It introduces Aisling of Buadair, who was apprenticed to the weavers\u2019 guild of that kingdom at the age of seven and has had her apprenticeship extended by her parents twice since then (each apprenticeship lasts seven years). Months short of her 28th birthday, when her parents shouldn\u2019t be able to extend her again, she sees them going into the guild headquarters and has a bad feeling that they\u2019re going to do it anyway. A peddler provides her with the necessary papers to leave the country (not an easy thing to do) and sends her on a mission to find an assassin to kill the usurper who holds the throne. All sorts of bad things happen to her along the way, but she does meet R\u00f9nach, a son of the black mage Gair (also the father of Ruith from the second Nine Kingdoms trilogy and Morgan from the first) whom we met briefly in Gift of Magic. (We met both Gair and R\u00f9nach in that book, for that matter.) And the two manage to end up traveling together, though their relationship is a bit prickly, since both have secrets they\u2019re unwilling to share. The romance side of this pairing is not very prominent in this book compared to its sequel, but the adventure side is stronger. I did note with interest that Aisling is shown on the cover aiming a longbow left-handed; on the cover of River of Dreams she\u2019s also aiming a longbow, but right-handed in that one. I\u2019d presume that if she were really that ambidextrous a point would have been made of it in the text, which it isn\u2019t, so I suspect the artist for this book was just careless. (Or possibly the picture was reverted in a transfer.)", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1KATMAV54RMH1"}}, {"Date": "on March 24, 2013", "Text": "Like the first Nine Kingdoms the start is a little slow but if you are willing to hang with it, the story will reward you. Allow me to start this review by saying I love this series. When I discovered it two years ago I fell in love with it. I have read the first trilogy but not the second so there some things that I did not know coming in but things like spoilers do not annoy me. This series is on my To Buy List. It is well written, fun, and just plain good. There is just one problems and it is the same problem I had with the first book Star of the Morning and that is it takes about 100 pages before you are really hooked into the story. I do not know if Kurland just needs some time to get things going but I warn you about that. That said do not let that stop you from reading this book because it is wonderful. I cannot wait for the next and I am going to be buying them all from Amazon from here on out. I like both main characters and we see old ones from the other books and they just add to the story. Some romantic tropes are here but do not let that annoy you just part of the show. The plot has me guessing at the moment but I was in the same position at the end of the first book in the first trilogy too but I trust Kurland. This is a wonderful series with inventive magic, clever heroes, and evil villains; what fantasy lover would not love this?
