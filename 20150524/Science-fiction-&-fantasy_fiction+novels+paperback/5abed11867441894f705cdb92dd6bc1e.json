I love mysteries and strong plots, and usually, Harris's writing has never let me down. Until now. I'm not going to rip into the woman but I will say this is the first book I've read of hers where I was bored reading it. Worse than hating it, I didn't care about any of the characters or there problems. I think it was because all th characters had secrets, so many secrets, that i wasn't able to identify with any of the characters. When the mystery was solved  and the killer revealed, I still couldn't care. I liked Figi well enough, but everybody (the characters) guarded their back stories so well that it  made them all dull. When Harris let me know interesting bits about her Midnight cast, it was too little too late. Sad to say, I didn't enjoy reading this book; I dredged through it. Ignore or believe me -your choice.

And her story telling generally has depth, pace and texture. This book, however, reads like a short story. There is little depth, the story line seems to bounce around, and her characters seem two dimensional.  Even characters we already knew well, like Bobo Winthrop, seem almost caricatures of their earlier incarnations. I guess it is being set up for the next books in the series.

She sticks with her real life tales of supernatural characters set in the back drop of the American south (well, it's Texas but still pretty close to being southern).  I definitely fell in love with the spirit and companionship of Midnight, TX and the unique hodge podge of characters.  The only thing I felt that was lacking with the book was the fact that it didn't start off in the typical way that her other books do where they suck you in and leave you constantly wanting more.  It just felt like a good start to what may become a pretty good series.  I suppose every author has their \"Gone With the Wind\" where nothing else they do could possibly live up to that one pinnacle of their career.

There is not a lot of action, especially in the beginning, and the reveals are slow but very clever, and the way Charlaine Harris brings out the secret details of Midnight's residents is extremely pleasurable.  At the same time, my major complaint is that the book is slow, and the murder mystery was not so much at the top of my list of concerns.

And you have the life in a small town aspect, out in the Texas boonies (I lived in south Texas for five years back in the 1980's, so I really enjoyed the setting).  There is a very interesting cast of characters, which I think she develops well.  All in all, I enjoyed the heck out of this book.  Oh, and one last thought.  I believe that this has been advertised as being the first in a series of three, and I hope that is the case.  However, this book can stand alone, as the story is actually wrapped up at the end.

Midnight, Texas looks like a pretty standard dried-up western town, with lots of vacant buildings and few full-time inhabitants. The people who do live there, as new resident, psychic Manfred Bernardo soon discovers, are a bit unusual, although most are friendly and helpful. His landlord, Bobo Winthrop runs Midnight Pawn during the day; at night his basement tenants, the chilling Lemuel Bridger and the beautiful and very capable Olivia Charity take care of the business. Fiji Cavanaugh, self-proclaimed witch, runs The Inquiring Mind in a cottage left to her by her Great Aunt Mildred, along with her unusual cat, Mr Snuggles. The reclusive Reverend Emilio Sheehan looks after the Wedding Chapel and Pet Cemetery. Madonna Reed cooks wonderful meals at the Home Cookin diner. The aptly named Joe Strong runs the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon with his partner Chuy Villegas. Shawn Lovell runs the busiest concern in town, the Gas N Go, while keeping a tight rein on his pretty daughter, Creek and handful of a son, Connor. Not long after Manfred\u2019s arrival, the body of Bobo\u2019s missing girlfriend is discovered, and suspicion initially falls on Bobo. A pair of strangers also threatens the peace of the town, and Midnight\u2019s residents take steps to protect their own. A diligent sheriff from nearby Davy, Arthur Smith is determined to flush out the killer. After a somewhat slow start as Harris sets the scene, the pace picks up and this novel is as intriguing and enjoyable as Harris\u2019s other short series: Aurora Teagarden, Lily Bard and Harper Connelly. Fans of those series will recognise Bobo from Shakespeare\u2019s Champion, Manfred from the Harper Connelly series, and Sheriff Arthur Smith from the Aurora Teagarden series. Harris peoples this series with interesting characters, her dialogue is witty and sharp, and the plot includes a vampire, white supremacists, gays, kidnapping, Halloween traditions, arson and a truly shocking climax.

However, I always liked Manfred Bernardo (from the Harper Connolly series) and certainly thought Bobo Winthrop (Lily Bard series) was a character who could stand to be fleshed out, so I gave it a try and I'm glad I did. I'll pick up the next book in this series when it comes out. It's nice to see Bobo all grown up (minor gripe: while it's perfectly normal for Southern men in small towns to have weird names in their hometown - my grandfather, Davis Bruce, was known as Doodle-Bug his whole life to his family - when they move, especially if they are trying to leave their past behind, they usually start using a grown-up version of their name. I hear there's an Aurora Teagarden crossover as well, but since that's the \"most\" in \"most everything,\" (the series bored me after awhile), but I can't say who. That said, this book reminded me more of her earlier books, especially the Lily Bard series, and the last few Sookie books, where character and viewpoint shifts and the plot is in the interactions and small doings of a little Southern town, and not so much wild vampire sex and life-or-death supernatural politics. If you enjoy cozy mysteries with a drop of the supernatural, you'll like this. If you picked up the Sookie series because you have read every (repetitive and badly written) book Laurell K Hamilton has published and you wanted more vampire sex, you will hate this book. Like most cozies, the murder (off-screen and without detail to a disagreeable character) is not a central focus, and is simply there to provide a reason for character interaction.

It does forgo the first person narrative but that's no sacrifice since the story is as wonderfully told as any Sookie book.  She also spreads the wealth in storytelling, letting you get to know intimately (after a bit) most of the residents of Midnight and they are an intriguing, well thought out bunch.
