The reason I am only giving it three stars is because it did not feel like a full novel, more like filler or a short story that is long ( if that makes sense).  I love the sisters stories and wait for them so it was a bit of a let down.  Also, the \" who is going to inheret\" is getting dragged on.  I will keep reading the stories but really hope the next has more substance.  For a lazy afternoon read it is not bad.", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A6SYU16FLXBJD"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Witches-Enemy-Novel-Mist-Torn/product-reviews/0451471334/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.6 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$7.99", "Salesrank": "#52,155", "ListPrice": ""}
