This book doesn't have a love triangle, instant love (although there is magic triggered sex), angst, a major cliffhanger ending, or over the top evil. The Shattered Court is a wonderful, enthralling fantasy with believable, likeable main and secondary characters in a well-built world with an intriguing magic system. The possibility of spoilers is very high with any detailed discussion, as all may not be as it seems... I checked Scott's website, and she is planning at least two books in The Four Arts series. I am very pleased that Sophie and Cameron will continue as the main characters, and I look forward to the next book.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AHPOH9230P4R1"}}, {"Date": "on May 18, 2015", "Text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this first book in Ms. Scott's next series.
