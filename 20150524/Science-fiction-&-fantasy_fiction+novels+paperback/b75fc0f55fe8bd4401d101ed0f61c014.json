I was there with the characters and in that silo from the first few pages. I could feel every emotion, frustration, and even the physical sensation of being dizzy and tired from the trips through the silo. The story kept building and I wanted to know everything and couldn't put it down. Truly superior writing and storytelling.

These books are truly remarkable.  As compelling a reading experience as the finest Stephen King, yet sci-fi to the core.  Mr. Howey has three great strengths that he employs in these 4 novellas and 1 short story:  1)  Great story-telling.  You feel like you are in the silo with these people.  2)  Characters you can relate to.  For me this is key.  Many sci-fi authors fall short in this area by having wooden, stock or boilerplate characters to complement their stories.  Not so in Wool 1-5.  I was riveted by the story and often stayed up into the early morning hours to read \"just one more\" chapter.  3)  Leaving you wanting more.  Luckily for me, Wool 1-5 left me wanting more.  There are many plotlines left to flesh out and areas to discover.  In fact, if there's one thing that impresses me most about Wool 1-5 it's that the author was able to make such compelling reading out of such a - on the surface at least - simple premise.  People living inside a concrete tube doesn't have to be compelling reading.  Yet thanks to Mr. Howey's unique ability to craft a compelling HUMAN story, Wool 1-5 rises far above the ranks of most sci-fi.  To me, these are modern day classics.  Awesome.  Simply awesome.  5/5", "Helpfulness": 0.8181818181818182, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AV1KSTDOW85QK"}}, {"Date": "on July 25, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8055555555555556, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2DC9XC9OJHRGX"}}, {"Date": "on June 7, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8103448275862069, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7Q8DIDD8ONMM"}}, {"Date": "on August 16, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8888888888888888, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1TBKC4L39JSU7"}}, {"Date": "on August 20, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8292682926829268, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3NNUDG8GXEFSI"}}, {"Date": "on February 29, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2N6ROIO1VNOET"}}, {"Date": "on September 4, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8285714285714286, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1A993AA3BKTOP"}}, {"Date": "on November 12, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8636363636363636, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AR29VVYCKTY40"}}, {"Date": "on March 31, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8461538461538461, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AERQG2VDOIQ54"}}, {"Date": "on November 23, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.84, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1HTP2WJSJD3ZQ"}}, {"Date": "on July 11, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7931034482758621, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A18UP36J88MP6B"}}, {"Date": "on April 24, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7872340425531915, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A22NSIO5HTBYXC"}}, {"Date": "on June 21, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7872340425531915, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A6HYEMFJH5JMN"}}, {"Date": "on June 9, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A80GXV4FT2Y4J"}}, {"Date": "on October 15, 2012", "Text": "Interesting enough to read, however did not live up to my expectations.

I had a feeling the author had spent countless hours imagining details and working out all the connections. Even so, I read Wool 1-4 and then decided I owed it to myself to dispense with reading Wool #5--which (unless there are a number of appendices) comprises nearly half of the Omnibus, so even at its bargain price, I felt I'd wasted my money. Wool #1 is the most rewarding of the five and the only one that can stand alone. The other four are all dovetailed installments, each one skirting around the same central mystery and evidently inching toward some climactic revelation--but the movement within each installment is very slow, in part because each one introduces a new main character (entailing a fresh round of back-to-square-one exposition and re-orientation); and in part because the prose bogs down in too many picayune moments. It's possible I missed a marvelous payoff at the end, but getting there wasn't worth the effort for me: I was simply never captivated, didn't really care how it all comes together. The weaknesses of the Wool Omnibus are numerous, but the slow pacing is the deal breaker: by the fourth installment I was only reading the first sentence of each paragraph, just getting through as quickly as possible (more like reading homework than reading for pleasure) and sad to say I could still follow the narrative quite easily that way, so again, not that much is really happening, and there aren't any key insights along the way. The second major flaw is the interchangeability of major characters: there are a lot of them, and they all have nearly identical personalities, the same ernest and stalwart virtues, despite their differing bodies and different roles in wool society. There are simply too many heroes here, yet they all seem like clones.", "Helpfulness": 0.7777777777777778, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A228DLA3BJ3DVD"}}, {"Date": "on February 7, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8333333333333334, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3M2EJH45XM0SD"}}, {"Date": "on February 22, 2012", "Text": "I am an avid reader of science fiction.

Like most of the best science fiction authors, the science fiction aspects of the story quickly take a backseat to the human condition and serve to enable us to learn about ourselves as part of the human race.  The last book I read that achieved similar results was the Sparrow.  Howey's series does this brilliantly while at the same time providing an exciting story with many unpredictable occurrences.  Second to the emphasis on human interaction for me, is the overall tone and feel of the book.  I felt a constant aura of weight and oppression throughout the story and the slight claustrophobic feeling of being trapped underground in the SILO was very effectively conveyed.  At the same time the driving force behind the plot is a balance between a building tension and impending tragedy racing a bubbling sense of hope and redemption.  The contrast between both doom and hope excellently creates that elusive feel most readers strive to capture in a story, namely the feeling that they must keep reading to find out what happens next.

There are a few things wrong with this book, but with almost 4,000 reviews it is still hovering at the 5 star mark. There are some complex themes, but they are not explored on a deep level. The ending was really not that awesome. The science was flawed and some of the rationale as to why things were the way they were was just not that compelling. For example if someone refuses to clean, why would the manual automatically assume a rebellion is underway? Similar explanations were somewhat superficial throughout the book.  Wool is sometimes referred to as Young Adult science fiction. The writing is definitely at a level that makes it accessible to a wide variety of readers. The bottom line here is that I could not put this book down. The characters were really well drawn and compelling, the universe of the silos and their strange ways was so incredibly interesting. I set aside a couple of Saturdays to get through it and I refused to touch it during the week because I knew I wouldn't be able to stop. About 10 pages into the story, I was hooked.

At first I wasn't sure that introducing so many characters in the first books would work--I mean--you get attached and then they are gone.  But, now I see how critical it is to the whole universe of Wool because the different perspectives and experiences of the characters just makes it all so much stronger and real.  Now that I have finished, I can't stop thinking about silos or nanotechnology and how seemingly intelligent (or not) ideas just go to hell and, in this case, contributed to the destruction of the world as we knew it.  Howey raises some great questions about the nature of humans, politics, power, rebellion...why do they clean? and so much more.  I love the idea that the entire series is going to come together and in the end I think we are going to see a final showdown between the people who created the world underground and those who have lived in that world for centuries.  The creators will have to full on face what they did and I am sure (especially Donald) is not ready for that. Who knows how this finale will play out, but I can barely wait to read it.

The story was amazing, keeping you turning the pages, not wanting to stop reading and not wanting the story to end because it's so good! There's not extra fluff, the prose isn't flowery - and yet it is written with much more beauty than most of the stuff I read. It has a way of giving you the story without extra padding or heavy description or exposition and yet makes you take a breath every once in a while to appreciate the refined poetic way Hugh Howey writes. This guy is a gifted storyteller AND a gifted writer. You don't see that often. It isn't easy to write in a way where the words don't get in the way of the story and the reader is able to just take it in and enjoy what's happening to the characters. If you get that in a book you know you're in good hands, but when they can do that and still sprinkle in amazing prose that has such a poetic beauty with wonderful images, similes, thoughtful ideas, well - you get Wool by Hugh Howey. Beyond all of that, the story world Hugh has built is so awesome! You just want to keep reading more about it. I'm so glad he's now writing the Shift books going back in time and telling us how the Silos came to be. I cannot wait to dig into the first prequel book First Shift! This guy is my hero.

I struggled for a minute to either give the series a 4 or 5 star, and decided on 5 to give Mr. Howey a benefit of the doubt. I probably have been reading a few too many novels lately and my brain cells haven't caught up yet. He reads all his reviews I've heard ;) I checked the reviews and was putting off purchasing until now based on a couple of reviews, I forgot their names but one woman from Texas said there seemed to be no hope. That is a bunch of drivel. Uprising is in the works.People in the story are fighting for the truth. Another fellow said there that Mr. Howey is too descriptive about objects. This too is drivel. Each author paints a picture and some use more brushstrokes.I didn't like Prip'yat from Mr Kraus as much as I liked Final Dawn.The first is more of a short the last a novel-series but the artistry is still there. I am new to post acopolyptic fiction and my favorite 3 are Howey, Kraus, and Molles. To me the greatest for a good story are believability and that the major characters don't shirk from their courage and become cowards, but expose the truth at all costs. I think there is an interest in this type of fiction because fiction many times parrallels reality. Most question now the truth in what the media says about 911 and how the bankers are spending more and more of our money but our economy gets weaker and weaker, and more of our freedoms are eroded. This questioning of authority and getting at the truth, not the propaganda is what seems parallel in this book of Mr. Howeys. For all you religious fanatics and those who are naive enough to think our government is there to protect us from the cradle to the grave. I too am christian, but read Romans 13 again and pay attention this time. The government is to be obeyed as it says. But the government described is a just government, one that upholds the good citizen and punishes the evildoer.When it does not there are exploits as it says in Revelation. And justly so. Mr Howey is a humble man. He even considers himself a nobody in his questions and answers on his website. I just ask him to not get caught up in his success and become proud, which I think will hurt his writing. I don't think he will but it should nevertheless be mentioned. Pride cometh before a fall.

I don't know why people constantly place speculative fiction books in the science fiction category.  This book isn't science fiction.  One could make an argument that it is speculative fiction, but I would argue against it, or at least it being on a best of list of speculative fiction.  The book is too prosey---I would have liked it better if there was less narrative prose.  The main character has no character arc--kinda dull in that respect.  The two characters who do have character arcs, Peter and Solo, are hardly even tertiary characters.  The plot is interesting, but not interesting enough to make up for the lack of interesting characters.  The first section of the book is about a character who isn't centrally important to the main narrative... I kept waiting for Holston's thread to mean something, but it doesn't.  I thought it was funny that Solo's real name is Jimmy; reminds me of another character named Jimmy who goes by another name, \"Snowman,\" (from Oryx and Crake).  I actually thought that that this book was going to at least be better than Oryx and Crake, but was quite underwhelmed with how the end was tied together.  One day I might get around to reading the squeal to that other Jimmy book (Oryx and Crake); however, I'll save my speculative fiction reading to more speculative speculative fiction books, hopefully ones with bigger words and ideas than wool had.

I have read books of \"constant tragedy\" before, such as Tolkien and Paolini, but something about Mr. Howey's writing, while it left me compelled to keep reading, it also so depressed and upset me while reading the bulk of it. I think I will still have to try another of his books and see if they feel as painful and depressing to read; I truly hope not!", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A4XYPSSZF80VV"}}, {"Date": "on October 8, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1K71PYEKI90D5"}}, {"Date": "on July 4, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1"}}, {"Date": "on July 4, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2NHERI3W195Y"}}, {"Date": "on August 31, 2012", "Text": "What a pleasant surprise!

Might have been on NPR, or in the Wall St. Journal. He wasn't sure, but I had just finished \"Dearie\", a superb biography of Julia Child, and was without a book and desperate for an excellent consumingly good one, since I had just come off a fabulous 'read'. Praying that it would be dystopian fiction rather than just science fiction, I snuck my daughter's Kindle out of her room and downloaded the e-book. First paragraph made me stop for a prayer of thanks: I knew I was in the best of hands. I could barely work and feed the family for the next two days, captivated and distracted by this amazing, compelling, heartfelt and brilliant story, wonderfully and vividly told. I could see it: I could SEE the view projected on the walls, and the wheat-colored dirt-and-dust outdoors, the steps and the blue and yellow jumpsuits, and feel terror during the big swim and long walk. It was beyond my deepest hope for a transporting, thrilling, heartbreaking and thought-provoking transcendant read. My heartfelt thanks to Mr. Howey, and may he write on and on and on and make tons of money so that he can have whatever he needs to make more books, and also be happy. What a gift.

First off, I think Hugh Howey has one of the most imaginative minds going right now. The overall concept of this story (which is still continuing) is fascinating, and the themes introduced take this beyond normal \"science fiction\". There are several primary characters featured throughout the five books of the Omnibus edition, but Howey does a great job giving them all a unique voice and story. My only criticism is that the ending to the fifth book felt very rushed. After pages of build up, the ending sort of just happened and then that was the end. There did not appear to be a climax to the story, with everything just \"working out\". I understand that this isn't the end of the overall series, but prior to the fifth book, each story seemed to have a natural conclusion. The fifth, however, made me feel like I had skipped over several pages, as if the author saw the finish line and dashed for it rather than continuing the pace set previously.

I simply refuse to give away any of the more intricate plot details. You need to read it for yourself. Suffice it to say, this vision of the future is very dark and grim. However, what sets this book apart in a science fiction sub-genre that is already over crowded with sub par writing is the prose itself. Howey is simply an exceptional writer.

I think the foremost is that book is incredibly \"organic\" i don't think that there is a force scene, character, or moment in the entire series everything that happens seems a logical consequence of the setting and the characters. Secondly none of the characters are really \"fiction-evil\" there is tons of conflict, sometimes bloody. But i don't think there is a single character who would not say that his/her actions were not in the best interest of everyone. The author does a fantastic job of making everyone understandable.

The canvas for this story is quite limited, as you soon learn, but this allows the author to focus on the characters and dialog like a good play rather than be distracted by magic, fantasy or futuristic technologies - not that I have a problem with magic, fantasy or futuristic technologies.

The plot is excellently constructed, the characters are rich and lovable, the suspense is great, and the ending is satisfying. It's amazing that Howey can tell such a rich story in such a bleak world with such a constrained setting. The writing is superb. Either Howey is a skilled editor himself, or this book was prepared by a professional copy editor, because there are none of the typos and little errors that are so common these days in all books, not just eBooks. One picky point: Howey should consider consulting someone about technical matters that he's not familiar with. He seems to think (for example) that radios are tuned by varying resistance, as with a potentiometer. That's wrong, of course. Circuits are tuned by balancing capacitance and inductance. Howey might also have done some research on factors that impede radio signal propagation, and antenna theory. Still, this is a small matter.

The surface of the planet is totally unlivable, and the populous lives in a huge underground \"silo,\" which houses thousands of people. I found the physical and social environment of the silo community to be fascinating. The structure begins at ground level and submerges about 100+ levels into the ground. People live their entire lives within the silo and never go outside. Life depends upon a highly technological society and is controlled by a highly developed IT compound situated in the mid-levels and a ruthless mayor who lives in the \"up top\" floors. All needed commodities, products, crops and other materials/items are produced within the silo. Different products and services are situated on specific levels and delivered where needed. The mechanical department, which handles life-support for the entire habitat, is located on the bottom levels (the \"down deep\"). The stairs are the only way to move from one level to another. Life in the silo includes rigid rules that must be followed, and breaking those rules incurs severe punishment from villainous leaders. Even speaking about certain topics or dissatisfactions can mean death by expulsion from the silo. Aside from its interesting environment and society, this book has many complex, colorful, eclectic, and endearing characters that endure excruciating situations and demonstrate heroic actions for the reader to appreciate. However, the reader must also endure breathless trepidation while characters are struggling for survival and gut punches from the death of characters. Wool is a totally engrossing story, which captures the reader until the end. In addition, Mr. Howey's prose makes it an even greater pleasure to experience this story. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes science fiction, and especially post-apocalyptic science fiction.
