The two guys feel as if they belong more in a Call of Duty video game (I say this as someone who loves video games). The women in this book are very poorly written. They exist only to serve the men as lovers. Lara is a terrible, boring excuse for a character. I found the fate of Kate to be eye-rollingly stupid.

Another reviewer mentioned that some of the little romantic moments were distracting and inappropriately timed. I agree: the kiss that elicited a moan from Lara during the shoot-out at the school? Elicited an eye-roll from me. The lovemaking scene between Will and Kate in the abandoned house?  Seemed a bit unwise with ghouls trooping by outside and wild dogs wandering in. The way that scene was written also came across as prurient, and I'm sure that was not the intention. Within minutes of disclosing to one another for the first time that they shared an attraction, Lara was apologizing to Will because she couldn't have sex with him that moment because of what the Sunday brothers had done to her?

It also gets a bit tiring when the antagonists already have what appear to be insurmountable odds in the their favor and the author continues to pile on to the protagonists.  A few errors in terminology and typing, but that has become the norm these days so if that turns you off you are getting less and less to read.

I was not bored for one minute reading it, and that's saying a lot for me as I'm not one to value endless details - I want the story to unfold without getting caught up in the minutiae.  I was very impressed that there were almost no typographical or grammatical errors either, so I'm guessing that either this author is very good with proofreading or he actually had an editor.

From character development to explaining YOUR idea of how the End of The World might happen, this first novel I've read of yours leaves me feeling like I've just lived through I Am LEGEND- 2007 ( I am legend is an adaptation of a sci-fi novel of the same name by Richard Matheson; a novel which also inspired the making of both George Romero\u2019s Night of the living dead and the 1970s movie Omega Man.  Robert Neville [Will Smith] is the last living man in New York and as far as he\u2019s aware the last living man on the planet. Immune to a killer virus that wiped out most of humanity and turned the rest into flesh eating zombies, the only reason he has for staying alive is to a find a cure. At night the virus victims who have become enraged night walkers stalk the streets, giving Neville only daylight to gather supplies and continue his work. Aware that his location will eventually be found Neville works against the clock to find the cure before it\u2019s too late.), The Terror Within-1989 (where the world has been changed by an accident involving Biological warfare as a result of this it horribly mutates humans into monsters called gargoyles.) Or one of my absolute TOP THREE ZOMBIE FLICKS, Night of The Comet-1984 (\"They Came. They Shopped. They Saved The World!\"  Cult sci-fi comedy from the 1980\u2019s had very little promotion on its release and would have slipped away into obscurity if it wasn\u2019t for a small but dedicated group of fans.  After a comet passes close by the Earth two sisters wake up to find that the majority of the worlds population have been disintegrated, leaving only a handful of mutated zombies roaming the streets. Seemingly the only survivors in an all but empty world, they set out trying to make sense of what\u2019s happened and soon stumble across another survivor. Together they take advantage of the vacant world that\u2019s become their playground unaware that scientists in an underground facility are monitoring their every move.).

You follow several groups of people across Texas as they battle their way through the undead and what they lovingly call the 'ghouls'. These creatures are not our normal everyday zombies. They are deathly allergic to sunlight, bullets do not kill them and they are smart. Way too smart. Will and Danny, two of the characters you will meet, are SWAT team members and ex-Rangers. They will have you chuckling throughout the entire book. They keep things lighthearted and have a great relationship. Always finding humor, even when the situation seems dire. As they meet up with other survivors and start to make their way to a safe house, you see the survivors begin to depend not only on them but on this continued lightheartedness. That if they can remain calm and joke around when thousands of these creatures are swarming them, then the situation must not be that bad. In this book, we see things get shot, blown up (which is always a favorite of mine), heads cut off and quick one-liners that bring a smile to your face.
