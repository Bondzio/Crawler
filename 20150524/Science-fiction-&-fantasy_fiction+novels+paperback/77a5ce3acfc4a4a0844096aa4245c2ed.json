By the time I was halfway through, I would've welcomed any kind of action: maybe a raccoon invading a garbage can or a deer running in front of one of their vehicles, anything. Seriously, I would have welcomed either of those scenarios just to break up the page after page monotony that is this book. I hate to say it after how much I enjoyed the first two books but \"Escaping Home\" is a \"snore fest\". I'll probably buy the next book in the series but if things don't speed up, that will be it for me. I gave this one 2 stars simply because I enjoyed the first two in the series, otherwise, it would've only gotten 1 star.", "Helpfulness": 0.8717948717948718, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AEI3IHU1T33YT"}}, {"Date": "on November 2, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.868421052631579, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3LMH6XH7TR7VN"}}, {"Date": "on October 31, 2013", "Text": "Morgan and his family were smart enough to prepare for the unexpected.  They built up a good back-up food supply, solar power to run the essentials, water supply, etc. It was enough for a while, but throw in some Feds that never heard of the constitution, a few jealous ex-neighbors and a firestorm erupts.  This is the story of a bug out after the fight gets personal.  Sarge and his men are a big part of the story, along with the hardware they brought to the party.  There is a lot of action and various sub-plots to keep the pages turning.  On another level, for anyone who has done any prepping or has plans to, the book does deliver a lot or realism and food for thought.  Overall, its a good story in the larger saga of the survival of Morgan and his family and friends.  It does leave some cliffhangers, though and the bigger action and whatever payback is coming will need to wait for the author to write the next installment.", "Helpfulness": 0.8846153846153846, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1I0MKOZ67K9Q8"}}, {"Date": "on November 22, 2013", "Text": "I have been reading some of the independent writers here and I expect a few type and grammar errors now and then.  Low budget by necessity.  Proofreading can be tough to get done I imagine. While the story continues here, annoyingly the grammar and type errors have multiplied.  A lot!  I found at least one every other page or so. Much shorter book than the previous 2 and much of it seemed like filler merely to expand the word count.  Honestly, I enjoyed the first 2 much better.  Is this what happens when an independent writer gets under contract? Seems like my 3rd grader proofread it.

I also really like how the civilians in the book want to remain civilians and just be left to live in peace. Too many stories like this feature the theme of a normal citizen who ends up becoming a soldier by default and then their life centers around that.

I had a hard time deciding between 3 or 4 stars but this one was not quite up to the level of the first two so my rating dropped to a 3 but I still enjoyed it in a different way than the others. All our regular gang are still here, though still not back together. Things switch between the guys & family, then we see what Jess is up to. This volume is not as action-happy as the previous two, there is still plenty of shoot 'em ups but there are definitely less than the norm. This left some periods where the story was all about talking about the next scheme or waiting for an episode to happen. What I can say though, is that this volume certainly improves on the character development of nearly every one of the major players. Thad had already been the most developed character and Morg too but we get to see a different side of Morg as he interacts with his family and we learn the different personalities of his three daughters. The soldier guys are all developed much further as well. I've really come to like this hodge-podge group of rough 'n' tough alpha males! The only one whose development was left out was Jeff.
