The graphics are really cool - the story is short. A lot is overlooked. I understand that it would be hard to remain really close and true to the initial story but I did miss the depth and suspense I encountered in the books. I would like to give it three and a half stars - mainly for the art work --.

My criticisms are that the writing on occasion seems a little stiff and it's not my favorite art. Don't get me wrong, the covers are incredible!
