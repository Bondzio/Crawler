Kauzmann's treatment of real gases is particularly useful because there are no perfect gases.  He refers to a volume II in this book, which I would also like to acquire, but if it was ever published I don't know when or under what title.  Perhaps a kind reader could inform me of this information.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1BX22OFAMN11L"}}, {"Date": "on July 9, 2014", "Text": "good", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A37SW0Z605RZKZ"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Kinetic-Theory-Gases-Dover-Chemistry/product-reviews/0486488330/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$18.70", "Salesrank": "#384,163", "ListPrice": "$24.95"}
