Quite a magical read.  The author presents complex scientific ideas in short, readable, cohesively-themed articles.  Each article is on a topic familiar to us, upon which he expands towards scientific ideas which may be unfamiliar to us.  There is enough overlap in the independent sections that the read feels like one is being 'taught' rather than just reading information.  And Tyson is first and foremost a great educator.

He is able to discuss these topics for even those who aren\u2019t famous astro-physicists or striving scientists; Tyson starts with basics and goes deeper, but as he does so, he breaks down the details explaining each step of the way. What makes the book more enjoyable, than simply reading articles about such topics, is Tyson\u2019s ability to speak to his audience through his book. He often times relates these phenomenons to everyday life; for example, \u201c... I was having a hot-cocoa night... I had ordered it with whipped cream, of course...I saw no trace of it\u2026 he asserted I couldn\u2019t see the whipped cream because it sank to the bottom\u2026 I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant\u201d (Tyson 37). I, personally, found myself chuckling now and then. His comical side notes not only made the book more enjoyable, but it did help put ideas/thoughts into more simpler terms. Besides his witty comments, the overall layout and order of the book helps readers get deeper into topics without sudden jumps from one idea to another; starting from more literal and concrete theories then slowly progressing towards more radical ideas. The overall fluidity made it a quick and easy read. Finally, Death by Black Hole contains the perfect amount of information in which readers may grasp each topic discussed without too much unnecessary information being thrown at them. It was reassuring  looking at the pages of work cited, starting from professors, to scholarly journals, to other published books because there are books that discuss such topics, such as outer space, that are solely based on the authors knowledge, or contain little/bais resources. Neil deGrasse Tyson gives factual thoughts and concepts with little bias and persuasion. I would definitely recommend this book to people who enjoy the topic of cosmology, physics, or just want to learn something new; on the other hand, I would not recommend this book to people who lack interest in the topics discussed because some parts may feel dragged on.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A11OFCH6PXIH8I"}}, {"Date": "on November 19, 2010", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ADY0QI5IENSLY"}}, {"Date": "on January 14, 2015", "Text": "He is amazing and his ability to make science fun is uncanny.

I found myself curious about the potential applications of antimatter.  When antimatter and matter make contact, they are annihilated, creating a ton of energy in the form of gamma rays.
