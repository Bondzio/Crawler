Since it is based solely on Elie Cartan's work, the termonology and wording reflects that of the transition coming out of the Post-Victorian math era (i.e., when quaternions and the more abstract mathematics where used for applied calculations in physics, which have been replaced with scalars and vectors). The geometrical definition layed down in the third chapter makes this a very comprehensive book for the newcomer to the subject. Quote page 42., \"A spinor is thus a sort of \"directed\" or \"polarized\" isotropic vector; a rotation about an axis through an angle of 2pi changes the polarization of this isotropic vector.\"", "Helpfulness": 0.8333333333333334, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3IQACD8KKCI7Z"}}, {"Date": "on May 12, 2009", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8888888888888888, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A147M6P4HLH7RT"}}, {"Date": "on December 3, 2012", "Text": "E.
