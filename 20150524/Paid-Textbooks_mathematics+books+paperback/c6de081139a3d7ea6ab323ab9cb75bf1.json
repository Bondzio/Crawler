Relativity was relatively new at the time (pun intended), so some of the discussion seems a bit beside the point now.

There is some stuff about visualization (pertaining to different models of space) that seems quite interesting.

I grew up on this book.  I picked this book up after high school and read it cover to cover several times over.  I regret to give such a negative review, but hindsight is 20/20.  I really don't believe Reichenbach explains matters that well.  I don't know if that is attributed to English being his second language or translation problems.  The introduction by Rudolph Carnap is worthy of five stars.  However, Reichenbach had a tendency to embrace nutty ideas.  And these ideas obfuscated the topic he was talking about.  His primary importance is not due to originality of ideas, but to being a member of the secret society known as the Berlin movement branch of the Vienna Circle and to slavish devotion to crediting Einstein with the relativity theory developed by Poincare and Lorentz.  His life was spent serving propaganda against Germany in Germany's attempt to preserve its national cultural integrity, promoting the myth of Einstein's genius, and publishing apologetic works in support of the Humean type myopia of the Vienna Circle Analytic movement.", "Helpfulness": 0.15789473684210525, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A15JFODPMUGF0M"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Space-Dover-Books-Physics/product-reviews/0486604438/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "3.8 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$12.05", "Salesrank": "#105,168", "ListPrice": "$15.95"}
