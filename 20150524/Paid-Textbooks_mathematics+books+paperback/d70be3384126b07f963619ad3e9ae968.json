I wanted a book that covered game physics and could help me reconnect to the math I was using on the job.  But this book, while covering every topic I was interested in does a very poor job of explaining what is going on.  The author often throws out a complex equation with no explanation of the terms and transforms the equation into a seemingly different variation with all new terms and zero effort to tie them together.  The code is too agnostic, and not useful for reading or using.  I am back at amazon looking for a better book, this one is to simple for someone versed in the math and lacks the explanations needed to help someone get back up to speed on the subjects.  If you had never had a college physics course or taken calculus you would not be able to get anything out of this book at all.", "Helpfulness": 0.5, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2DZEINNE7PWF9"}}, {"Date": "on February 22, 2006", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.42857142857142855, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3VRE49KH5JXP6"}}, {"Date": "on September 3, 2009", "Text": "The book covers a lot of topics, all very well explained.
