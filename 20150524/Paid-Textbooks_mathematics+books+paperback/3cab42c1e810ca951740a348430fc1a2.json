What a book to read if you want a glimpse of where science is taking us in the future!  This highly interesting read does a great job of explaining current and future possiblities of tracking, improving and studying the human brain.  From current research of creating prosthetics which can be controlled from thought to 'helmet' scanners which can read your thoughts to portable body scanners like \"Doc\" from Star Trek used - the future possibilities are amazing.  There is so much work being done in creating ways to actually read one's mind - which would be of enormous benefit for some people stricken with disease...to implants in the brain to stimulate thought, movement, recovery from stroke or traumatic brain injury.  The book lightly touches on the downside of such technology - could police use some of these devices which are currently in development to read your mind? could the government?  What are the ethical implications of this technology?  How could it be controlled once it's on the open market?  The author did a great job of presenting the information in an easy to read, understandable format - I almost read the book in one sitting the concepts were so interesting.  The book touches on the amount of research being done by private companies as well as DARPA, and it left me feeling that  futuristic science fiction movie plots aren't really that far away from becomming a  reality.", "Helpfulness": 0.9444444444444444, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A33UZDO4KB4S0H"}}, {"Date": "on February 19, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9333333333333333, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A122SFGLAHQLSJ"}}, {"Date": "on February 28, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8823529411764706, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AB17Y03366TV4"}}, {"Date": "on January 24, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS"}}, {"Date": "on April 28, 2014", "Text": "This is my first reading from this author and was expecting much more because I really enjoy him whenever I see him on the screen.

The book will frustrate you, because Kaku gets his facts wrong so often--which is surprising given that Kaku is a scientist. For example, his theory of consciousness is not a theory of consciousness at all. It is sort of a theory of one kind of mental function, but certainly not a theory that has any chance of explaining why we need to have subjective experience (qualia). One could easily argue that Kaku's concept of consciousness, which centers on the mental function of making mental models of the future, could conceivably have nothing to do with conscious experience, since it may well be possible to create such models unconsciously. By the way, Kaku uses the term \"subconscious\" instead of \"unconscious,\" a term that carries its own misleading implications. And Kaku completely misconstrues David Chalmers' \"hard problem,\" among many other errors. Finally, Kaku tends to go on and on with long passages in which he ruminates about issues that he imagines might come up in the future, such as which children robots should be programmed to rescue in a disaster. With all that said, however, if you don't know anything about theories of consciousness or cognitive science, you might enjoy the book.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A15DEKAR06YSBF"}}, {"Date": "on December 26, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1V7Z8Q0V8AWVR"}}, {"Date": "on February 3, 2014", "Text": "If you haven't read Michio Kaku before, you are missing out.

The current brain research being done is amazing in scope, and the hope that ways to fix brain illnesses or irregularities, which affect all of us in some way, will  be found. Startling fact: half of our population over 80 will develop Alzheimer's, a human catastrophe that is slowly unfolding. Then there's Parkinson's, ADHD, depression, autism, and on and on. What scientific research could be more important to the fate of mankind than knowing more about our brains? But the book is about much more than just what's happening now.

But the author of this book, who has no qualifications as a cognitive scientist, brushes all those concerns aside and simply declares, as if with papal infallibility, that the mind is nothing more than what the brain does. His assertion is treated as a self-evident fact, so no empirical evidence or compelling reasoning is offered in support of this hypothesis. A scientific hypnosis, unlike a philosophical theory or religious belief, must lend itself to empirical validation or refutation, but this reductionist hypothesis does not. Nevertheless, Kaku presents it as a scientific fact. This is pseudoscience at its worst.  As the historian Daniel Boorstin pointed out, the greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance, but the illusion of knowledge. By presenting the illusion of knowledge that the nature of consciousness and it's role in nature is already known scientifically, Kaku obstructs open-minded inquiry into this aspect of reality that has so far eluded scientific discovery.", "Helpfulness": 0.712, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A12OSBVN11PFVJ"}}, {"Date": "on February 18, 2014", "Text": "A Physicist\u2019s take on the human mind, and where the latest science is and future possibilities on consciousness, the possibilities of telepathy, the possibility of telekinesis or just moving things by using your minds.

With this one though it made me think here is a guy that is extremely smart and well spoken on some topics (technology, cosmology) but left me really wondering on others.  The first was with the definition of consciousness.  Kaku summarizes  consciousness as the ability to perceive the outside world and formulate models of it into the future.  The first few times he uses this definition I thought he may be planning to expand on it but instead he repeats endlessly.  To casually make this assessment on what is a topic that could take up several books was bothersome to say the least.  To add to this he talks of advancements to the mind only in terms of our current socio economic predicaments.  For instance he speaks of  a sort of telepathy that could be used on the battlefield overlooking that 1)future wars may not have human ground troops 2)if we could have telepathy we may find better ways of solving problems than shooting chunks of metal at eachother.  But more frustrating was the lack of discussion of the spiritual aspect of the human brain.  He talks about how we can be smarter and happier but not nicer (ie less psychotic).  This would be a controversial discussion no doubt and I hear you on the fear of a borg/bravenewworld scenario . Yet still with all the fascination of the brain of Einstein why not some mention of the brain of Ghandi, King, Gotama?  On the one hand you have the supposed techie nerds wanting to build HAL or Lawnmower Man and on the other are the supposed hippie granola types that appear to think humanity would be better off plowing fields and destroying all our gadgets. I have been looking for a book that is not aligned in either camp but sees the value in both.  Other than Ray Kurzweil not much out there.  On a personal note I am more bitter with the neo hippies that dont see the value in adding their voice to the AI/Mind Enhancement topic.

Bu Kaki and his colleagues have given rise to a plethora of movies and TV series focused on the misuse or outright evil cooked up by the world's bad guys to take advantage of super or telepathic brains, brain networks and intelligent robots. Then Kaku switches over to the vastly more complicated subject of aliens from outer space. Even though we have not yet to find one, Kaku dives in these soon-to-be-charted waters. The professor provides much interesting speculation on the consciousness and intelligence of these creatures who may be trillions of years ahead of us and as interested in us as we are in fruit flies. More than a popularizer, Kaku interviews many of the science protagonists mentioned in his book. And he he seems to know just what questions to ask the not-always-communicative scientists.

Unfortunately, science isn't quite there. Yet. But that hasn't stopped Dr.Kaku from taking us \"one step beyond\" in his exploration of what the present state of physics suggests might be possible in the not too distant future. If you have a literal mind, this is not a book for you. Dr. Kaku's speciality is theoretical physics not material science so he does what theorists are supposed to do: extrapolate from what we know and have the equipment to measure or observe right now to the furthest edge of possibility. It can be argued that we are only in the very early stages of \"brain science\" but the rate of discovery in the field is progressing exponentially. Almost daily researchers publish new - and often unexpected - findings on how the physical brain functions. We are beginning to be able to see the path of a thought as it travels the neuro-circuits of the physical brain. But thought itself cannot be seen, weighed, or measured in any way. It is invisible and leaves only the faintest temporary imprint for us to observe. Dr. Kaku wrestles with the problem of consciousness in his quest to understand the MIND. Our minds use our brains to record and communicate thought. But is Mind identical with Brain? This is the question that must ultimately be asked and answered. What IS consciousness and where does it come from? Is it dependent on the brain or does it exist in the quantum universe and express itself through conscious creatures in the form of thought? And, if so, does that mean that pure consciousness really does exist and that it has intention and will? Dr. Kaku is one of our planet's most enquiring minds and he'd like to know. So would I.

The fact that this frustrating individual goes to say there is no cure and people get it wearing pots on their head is insane. And, it is frustrating to see this authors popularity which encourages unsuspecting consumers too have dangerously incorrect knowledge.

I think it is time for humans to accept that these heavy metals all around us are causing insanity, psychosis, mood swings, halucinations.

Im so sad that Americans are allowed to get sick, forced to live a low quality of life, forced to stay out of work and rely on big government.
