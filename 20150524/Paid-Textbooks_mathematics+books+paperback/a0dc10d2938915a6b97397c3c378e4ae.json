It is devoid of the juvenile partisan political nonsense that makes \"Alcohol Can Be a Gas\" so unbearable to read for anyone firmly grounded in the real world.  If you are serious about making alcohol fuel this book will tell you what to expect and most of what you need to know.  If you are interested in Utopian communal farming and somehow trying to squeeze 10,000 gallons of ethanol per acre from cattails or fermenting that 5,000 gallons of organic cheese whey that you have in your back yard, \"Alcohol Can Be a Gas\" would be the better choice.", "Helpfulness": 0.9259259259259259, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1AL6JMZPDZYDK"}}, {"Date": "on December 10, 2009", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3RANEB7589H1Z"}}, {"Date": "on February 20, 2012", "Text": "This is a great book that is well worth the read if you are the least bit interested in using ethyl alcohol as a fuel.  It gives a great overview of what you can expect if you want to build your own still and create your own fuel.  What it lacks is the political propaganda, which is what attracted me to continue reading until the very end.  I would highly recommend this book for the alternative fuel beginner just to get a glimpse of what is possible.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3EP6EKPVXPOTI"}}, {"Date": "on April 10, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2MMBGNSSJV6YM"}}, {"Date": "on January 11, 2010", "Text": "Alcohol fuel is a very well written guide to making small scale alcohol fuel.The author obviously has alot of experience with this subject.I bought it for a different perspective from \"Alcohol can be a Gas\" which it is.If I had to choose I would go for \"Alcohol can be a gas\" first because it contains much more information.However Alcohol fuel is still a very useful book for anyone seriously considering making their own fuel.", "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A6I4U5YTP0YWQ"}}, {"Date": "on January 12, 2013", "Text": "This book answered all questions I had to complete my project.

It is organized from a US perspective, but people outside of the US will still find it useful.It has good explanations with supporting tables, that should give the renewable fuel newbie a good understanding of the processes and the requirements.
