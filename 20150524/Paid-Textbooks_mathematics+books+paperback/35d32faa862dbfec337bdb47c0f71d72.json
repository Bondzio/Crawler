Like a book by M. Nakahara it describes basics of diff geometry and topology. Though it stresses physical intuition more than formal definitions. I especially liked discussion of  fiber bundles and  characteristic classes.

I think it's all right for an author to engage in hand-waving arguments if this enhances physical intuition or even to make the occasional statements without proof if this allows more ground to be covered.  However, if a proof actually is presented, I expect this proof to be correct.  In this book, proofs are sometimes only for special cases of theorems stated more generally and often contain logical errors.", "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ADRU0P0DUUN8D"}}, {"Date": "on January 15, 2004", "Text": "This book shows you the geometric view of some advanced mathematical topics.
