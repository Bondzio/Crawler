It does this, but the majority of the book explains cosmology and quantum physics that is already widely written about by other scientists. It talks about the age, shape, size, and expansion of the universe, relativity, and other things even a casual science reader such as myself have already read and watched documentaries about. There are about three chapters in this book, starting with chapter 4, that have anything to do with the \"universe from nothing,\" and most of those discuss other topics more than the subject I was reading the book for. While there is some setup required to understand the \"universe from nothing\" parts, what is in the book should be obvious to a person who has read cosmology stuff before. A lot of the book is bragging of the author's achievements, and Richard Dawkins's afterword talks about the book as if it is some classic (along with the usual smug religion-bashing), which it is not. I recommend this book to a person who hasn't already read books and/or watched documentaries about the universe and I do not recommend it to someone who is already familiar with the common topics.", "Helpfulness": 0.8214285714285714, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2P721N0YID6J5"}}, {"Date": "on May 29, 2012", "Text": "Being a Christian I was a little apprehensive to read.

One possible state of the field is the universe that we know and love. Another possible state of the field is the absence of all matter. It is the latter state which Krauss suggests we may as well call nothing. He understands that it isn't nothing (which he calls the \"philosopher's\" nothing) and he spends a chapter arguing why his equivocation is justified. His argument to justify his equivocation fails and, hence, Krauss doesn't really inform us how the universe began to exist from nothing. And while it is very interesting to hear how the universe came from SOMETHING (truly it is), it is not nearly as interesting as it would be if he showed how the universe could come to exist uncaused from nothing.", "Helpfulness": 0.8, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3U02PWG8040RC"}}, {"Date": "on May 25, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ABN5K7K1TM1QA"}}, {"Date": "on January 30, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8125, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1IN2ZQP7GYHS6"}}, {"Date": "on June 5, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Y3RM29VLH9SL"}}, {"Date": "on March 14, 2012", "Text": "It's hard for me to rate this book, as I found I was unable to understand a considerable amount of it.

As it is approached on several different occasions throughout the book, the assumption of a supernatural force (i.e. a god) in the process of cosmic origins is irrelevent if not completely superfluous in understanding how the universe came to be.

This is a good, honest book by a physicist (cosmologist) who tries very hard to explain the staggering impact of discoveries in physics over the past century--inflation, the Big Bang, the microwave background and quantum fluctuations, a flat universe, dark matter/energy making up 99% of the universe and providing a negative gravitational pressure/energy that provides for continuing expansion of the universe, a calculation of the age of the universe at 13.72 billion years, etc.-- totally changing our perception of reality. He argues that space and time not only can, but must, come from  nothing (no mass, no energy, no space) via quantum fluctuations and inflation.  He includes a good jibe against theologians and string theorists alike--\"physicists don't invent things they can't observe to explain things they can\", but incongruously seems to like multiverses.

He explains that virtual particles materialize in the empty space near electrons, but he concludes from this that the virtual particles jump into existence from nothing.  This conclusion, however, contradicts his more detailed explanation of how virtual particles come into being.  According to the explanation he gives, they are created by the quantum activity of the electrons that are present in space, and, according to science, electrons are something - not nothing.  He also concludes that virtual particles could jump in and out of existence within the empty space between galaxies just as they do within the space between electrons and protons - but again, like electrons and protons, galaxies are something, and their presence, according to the proton/electron analogy, is necessary for the creation of the virtual particles.  In addition, he says that empty space really isn\u2019t empty.  It is full of dark matter and energy that we cannot see.  So again, if empty space is full of dark energy, virtual particles are not being created from nothing. But the whole point of the book (according to its title) is to show that something can be created from nothing (which one would assume means absolutely nothing instead of almost nothing or seemingly nothing).  And because this book is ultimately an attempt to claim that a god is not necessary to explain the big bang and the possible creation of our universe from absolutely nothing (no time, no space, no matter, no energy), I think the book fails.

He does not have much regard for those who are critical of his perspective based on the existence of a Supreme Being or Prime Mover.  God is a creation of the human mind and is left for the field of theology, not science.  If you have strong feelings about the existence of God, you will not appreciate this book.  For others, I think you will enjoy the trip.

As a result of this environment, quantum fluctuations , provided what was needed to create the solar systems and milky ways ,in these zero energy vacuum universes. Like Hawking ,he uses Feynman`s \"sum of histories\" or \"sum of paths\", a quantum concept for predicting the probability of virtual particles popping in out of existence on a subatomic level and transfers it to virtual universes popping into existence but zero energy allows these universes to stay in existence and bypass Heisenberg`s Law of Uncertainty. We therefore have a multiverse of universes. He uses these concepts with brilliance to illustrate why we do not need a creator and how the universe and it`s laws are self sustaining. These ideas and mathematics are a product of physicists over the last forty years from Professor Guth to Linde who were involved with the Chaotic Inflation and Alexander Vilenkin's Model of Cosmic Origins and Hawking. A great summary for the background of Cosmology is John Gribbin`s Cosmology for Beginners. <...>.

The afterword, by Richard Dawkins, echoes (rather gleefully) this point. I feel that both fail to establish that point. While I agree that we will probably never be able to prove a creator, I don't think they can prove the negative. If they are so willing to credit string theory as possible despite the fact that it calls for seven or eight dimensions that we cannot see or experience in any way, why not at least allow for an intelligent creator who established the rules of physics at or before the big bang.

I had hoped the author could provide insights. I was disappointed and confused. I'm not sure if the book is a scientific work or a theological one. The author spends much of the time trying to convince the reader that God does not exist , or is unnecessary for the universe  to exist. He fails to make the distinction between \"God\" and \"religion\". \"God\" is simply the root cause of existence, be it a sentient being or a quantum fluctuation. Since we exist, \"God\", or the root cause must exist. QED. \"Religion\" is the mythology, if you will, promulgated by theologians who attempt to explain/define their \"God\". Krauss proffers \"Nothing\" as science's surrogate for God but fails to define \"Nothing\". He accuses theologians of offering God as the \"creator\" without any empirical evidence to support its existence, instead offering \"faith\" as the rationale for acceptance. Yet he offers the reader \"Nothing\" as the \"creator\" with no empirical evidence to support its acceptance. I might easily choose either \"God\" or \"Nothing\"  based upon \"faith\".The conundrum continues to confront me. If you cannot define \"Nothing\", how can you claim it exists? If you can define \"Nothing\", then once it is defined it is \"Something\", no longer \"Nothing\". The book has not given me any relief for my confusion but suggests that we are faced with an ongoing debate between a theological creation and a scientific one. I tend toward the scientific. It offers empirical proof of some of the issues that theologians refuse to accept by simply rejecting irrefutable scientific evidence. The intransigence of theologians seems not to have changed since the church disavowed the teachings of Galileo. I am still waiting for the answer. I hope it comes soon.

Answering the question, who or what created God. That it wasn't matter or energy which first came from Nothing, but metaphysical principles(relationships), which interrelated, and became the underlying mind to the rest of reality, spiritual and physical.

That the universal mind is relational in nature, Alive Information, which is why the afterlife seems so alive to people who experience a NDE.

Which is why God favored the Jews as his chosen people, being so verbal. Also explaining why Jews produce more lawyers, bankers, and media people than mechanics, artists, and laborers.

The right brain doesn't like to follow the verbal rules that come from the right brain. Thus Hitler didn't follow laws, except the laws which he liked.

I agree with most of the one star reviews and add a few points. I have a Doctorate in Philosophy and have done research in the history of science; I taught philosophy for 20 years.  First, the two chapter titled \"Nothing is Something\" and \"Nothing is Unstable\" are shocking to a person who intuitively knows that beings exist outside his mind.  In grad school, I remember a course in Medieval Logic where the professor said the Medieval logicians held that 'if you begin your argument with a contradiction (eg. 'nothing is something'), then anything follows' meaning that you can say anything no matter how illogical. Krauss does just that. Second, he says that philosophy and theology have nothing to say about the meaning of life.  This is stunning, indicating that Prof Krauss thinks life as he conceives it is reduced to physics; however the average person must take on faith (on the authority of Dr. Krauss)the directly unobservable theoretical entities like particles and multiple universes as well as philosophical principles like 'Nothing is Something'.  Thus, religious faith and philosophical knowledge are replaced with faith in the physicist as his only guidance in life; but physicists disagree and so do the Darwinians, so whom do we follow? Third, it amazed me that there was no mention of Chance in the extensive index.  Fourth, Prof. Dawkins says in an Afterword that material particles \"go into and out of existence like fireflies\"; apparently it is just their nature to go back and forth from nothing to something which would indicate there is a real difference between Nothing and Something. As a former teacher of philosophy, I am convinced that the first principle of THOUGHT and REALITY is the Principle of Identity or Non Contradiction which goes back to Aristotle and forward through Aquinas and to the 20th century Thomists like Gilson, Maritain and Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange, who said frequently that the intellectual choice is between \"God or Radical Absurdity\"; this book exemplifies radical absurdity. As a conclusion I would say that Krauss' book is very bad philosophy mixed with some standard modern physics although I cannot judge the physics.  As an antidote to Krauss' book, one could read \"The Devil's Delusion\" by David Berlinski, \"The Science Before Science\" by Anthony Rizzi, and \"The Quantum Enigma\" by Wolfgang Smith (all I believe available through Amazon);  all the authors have great expertise in modern physics as well as philosophy.", "Helpfulness": 0.4788732394366197, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3CCLNCBIJJUGV"}}, {"Date": "on February 8, 2013", "Text": "Here is an attempt to make the latest developments in quantum mechanics and cosmology accessible to the ordinary man.

I don't even no where to \"begin\" (pardon the pun)  Let's start with the preface, \"he says, Who created the creator?\"  that question makes absolutely no sense.  Asking when the eternal God didn't exists, doy.  Then in the preface he says, the existence or non-existence of a creator is independent of our desires.  Actually Lawrence, you have it backward, the existence of Jesus is not dependent on our desires.  The right answer to the wrong question is always wrong.  Then he states also that the laws of physics COULD, we're talkin science here not philosophy bud.  he says could probe new scales through physics. but we simply don't know.  He admits there are some things we don't know so actually we know that we don't know-epistemological suicide.  That alone proves absolutes.  then he says THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD, something from nothin MAY have been required for the universe to come into being.  Then he says nothing upsets the philosophers and Theologians more than the notion of what truly \"nothing\" is.  When he quotes that he's being philosophical, so don't try to play this scientists vs Theologians game.  Science is about the interpretation of facts.  then he says something funny again \"everyone now knows the universe is 13.72 (i love the .72 makes look \"scientific\") billion years old.  Another lie, or unintentional interpretation of the facts.  This book tries to disprove hell.  If you want evidence for the Bible, just google in search of the real mt sinai and look at the archaeological evidence, i could keep going but, people seem to believe what they want to believe not what's actually true.  And on judgement day that's not gona work.  Jesus loves us and payed our death, trust Him, and follow Him and it's all safe.  I would have no problem if hell didn't exists but that's not reality.

In this book, I am not sure why there was such a mixture of religious dogma combined with  physics, but clearly he is an atheist and pushes this thought down your throat in several chapters. I reached a point i could not read any more after his repeated arguments that there is no reason for a God, that I threw the book away, and I will never desire to read anything more from this author.The issue is not whether he is right or wrong, but whether he has a right to argue against God on this pulpit of a book that you are thinking your reading something about physics. If he has the wherewithal to think he can speak to all of us or even argue that his subject about 'nothing' disproves God, then he should have titled the book appropriately. Because Lawrence cannot seem to decipher the difference between God and physics, I had a hard time determining the subject of this book.  For myself, this is a very distasteful exposition, and i never care to read anything more from this author as he has proved to me he is not really interested in educating me in his physics, but educating me in his wisdom about the universe as he sees it, including his disbelief in God. I'm done.
