What I liked about it is that it develops everything with Rigor from the fundamentals.  Chapter 6 is very useful for wave guides, but it covers most all topics in wave propagation.  Great reference, could be better if it had more examples, but what it lacks in examples, it makes up for in its detail derivations of all of the basic principles.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/APOCSU6WX0QWO"}}, {"Date": "on January 10, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AJA1CDVKXQC3C"}}, {"Date": "on November 6, 2014", "Text": "it's useful\uff01", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AV65069NC49VA"}}, {"Date": "on December 31, 2003", "Text": "to study this hard subject, subject as hard as QM in physics, can become the #1 nation boss!", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AYHV2ZOYJK4OP"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Propagation-Elastic-North-Holland-Mathematics-Mechanics/product-reviews/0720403251/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.8 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$64.53", "Salesrank": "#1,197,750", "ListPrice": "$72.95"}
