I think the book is well done, but a good part (a quarter or so) of the book is at a 2nd year calculus review-type level, much more so than most mathematical physics books (e.g. Boas or Arfken). The encyclopedic book by Riley-Hobson-Bence, which I like except for its sheer size, does also have review chapters, but most of that book is still at a higher level. If you want something about signals and noise in the text, this is the book, otherwise, I think the others may be a better choice for advanced undergraduates.", "Helpfulness": 0.9, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2QUC51QJS7FJ"}}, {"Date": "on April 28, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2DGHX87BFHYMR"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Physics-Michael-M-Woolfson/product-reviews/0199289298/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "3.7 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$63.75", "Salesrank": "#1,948,287", "ListPrice": "$75.00"}
