The physics is always at the  forefront, by the use of clever models and analogies. Either whether you  start your General Relativity here or read this book in parallel to more  standard texts, you'll be a much better practitioner. The treatment of  neutron stars, for instance, is \"just elegant\", as Marilyn Monroe  would say.", "Helpfulness": 0.7674418604651163, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on August 16, 2012", "Text": "I'm not reviewing the book - I'm reviewing the printed copy. Like most Dover books from a few years ago, the copy is decent but not outstanding. For the price, one can't complain. The pages are on the thin side and text from the obverse is visible if a single page is viewed in a well lit room. The binding is standard for a paperback. Characters are usually crisp, but there is some very mild ghosting - enough to be visible if looked for, but not enough to be distracting during ordinary reading. All in all, a great buy for the price and thank you Dover for keeping books like this in print!", "Helpfulness": 0.25, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1S4TVC7TD4GYU"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Stars-Relativity-Dover-Books-Physics/product-reviews/0486694240/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.5 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$19.76", "Salesrank": "#1,146,927", "ListPrice": "$21.95"}
