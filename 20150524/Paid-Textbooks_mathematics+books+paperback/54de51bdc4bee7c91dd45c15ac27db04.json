It is a remarkably clear introduction to some important topics in the philosophy of science: the nature of scientific laws, probability, scientific measurement, the structure of space, causality and determinism, theoretical concepts and laws, and a last chapter called \"beyond determinism\". The point where Carnap gets a bit formal, sections 26-28, is boring and absolutely out of date; his approach to analyticity is certainly not the best available. As for the rest, Carnap's conceptions are generally reliable (although it should be observed that his \"logical conception\" programme for probability was a complete failure). The sections I enjoyed most are those which deal with the structure of space. Carnap is highly proficient there (Carnap's doctoral dissertation was called \"Der Raum\") and his philosophical observations are always lucid and precise.", "Helpfulness": 0.9615384615384616, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on July 7, 2004", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.896551724137931, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2M9XZ2UD8ZM40"}}, {"Date": "on September 16, 1997", "Text": "This is probably the clearest account of the way Science works and why certain decisions are made.  Within it is contained the clearest explanation of portions of General Relativity (as a concrete example of why Einstein presented the theory in the manner he did) I've ever read, as well as many other little interesting tidbits.

The author explores how abstract ideas are the foundation for science (since they allow us to quantify and organize experience), and how we apply them. What I liked about it is that it wasn't just a book packed with scientific facts, but explored and examined ideas thoroughly.
