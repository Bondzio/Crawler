It is also wonderful that there is an audience that wishes to learn these subjects. It is assumed that you know linear algebra and complex variables. If you have not had these subjects or need a refresher, you will have a better time with this book if you study or review these subjects. I would recommend the Cliff Quick Review of Linear Algebra by Leduc and Chapter 1 of Schaum's Complex Variables 2nd edition by Spiegel. They both have many worked out problems and the books are inexpensive.There are more expensive alternatives like Engineering Mathematics by Stroud or Shankar's Quantum Mechanics textbook which cover these areas.  Susskind makes heavy use of spin and the Pauli Matrices as a basic model for quantum mechanics. A similar approach was taken in Jordan's Quantum Mechanic in Simple Matrix Form published in the 1980s and available on Dover. Susskind is a good teacher and further simplifies the math, probabilities,  commutators, and operators to make the subject more easy to follow. The introductions to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger Equation, and Entaglement  are nicely done and are a good read. If you want to learn some concepts of basic Quantum Mechanics and are not adverse to the math described this book will fill that need. Learn or review the mentioned math first or you will be lost quickly. You need to know what a complex number is,why we need complex numbers, how to obtain a complex conjugate, and Euler's famous formula. Susskind covers this in three short pages which is unlikely to mean much to you if you do not remember or know the math.  It will also help to watch the lectures on You Tube.  The major flaw of the book is the excercises.  They range from easy to hard. The answers are not provided and the techniques for answering them should be fully worked out. This should have either been added as an appendix to the book or posted on the web. These excercises are meant to test and rewire your brain. They are important teaching tools but  most of us do not have teaching assistants to check our answers and help us when we are lost. What may be obvious to the teacher is frequently not obvious to the rest of us. I have taken off one star for not have a longer chapter on the math required. I have also taken off a star for the lack of answers (worked out would be even better) for the excercises.", "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A38AKHUK96FH9F"}}, {"Date": "on February 27, 2014", "Text": "I like the book.
