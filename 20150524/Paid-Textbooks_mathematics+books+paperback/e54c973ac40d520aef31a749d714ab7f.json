It provided an excellent quick review on some topics from a while back, and a great summary and introduction to topics I needed to know for the course but had never been taught. Its not a substitute for taking a calculus course, but it is a great review if calculus was a while back, or if you never covered certain topics. Either way, this book will come in handy throughout your physics courses.", "Helpfulness": 0.8461538461538461, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A8TDR5HXUNQTX"}}, {"Date": "on May 14, 2008", "Text": "Probobly the best summery of mathematical physics an undergraduate could buy.
