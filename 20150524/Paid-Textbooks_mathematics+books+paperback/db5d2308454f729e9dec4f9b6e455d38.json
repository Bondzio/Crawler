The examples are quite old, but I expected that given the date of publication.  However the content itself is not very good.  The format of the book takes some mathematical concept  and tries to wrap it around a spaceflight idea.  However there is very little insight provided to the student.  The format is also overly verbose and hard to read. I'm a practicing aerospace engineer and teacher and I could come up with problems that are better worded and better illustrate both the mathematics and the spaceflight concepts.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2ZX7ALG4SG6QW"}}, {"Date": "on February 20, 2013", "Text": "I'm an adult learning math, and this book is great! It perfectly illustrates how algebra is used in one of my favorites areas of interest, astronomy!
