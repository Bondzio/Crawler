Requiring no mathematical background whatsoever, Mr. Hausner makes the properties of vectors and  matrices (cross-products, determinants, eigenvalues) intuitively obvious.  With detailed descriptions and graphics, the science of vectors is made  very clear.  Further, Mr. Hausner's use of levity and practical examples  makes for a very enjoyable read.", "Helpfulness": 0.9411764705882353, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1FLOIQH84ZIUE"}}, {"Date": "on September 8, 2000", "Text": "I have been reading many books on vector analysis, geometry, and linear  algebra this year.  Many of them have been good, but this book stands alone  for deriving the basics of determinants, vector products, geometry, etc. in  a clear and intuitive manner along with great examples.

I got it hoping to learn about projective transformations for computer graphics, but was disappointed because of the method of presentation was too long to get through.  I believe the text would appeal to those whose interest was strongly in geometry and had a college level background in math. I gave it three stars for the seemingly interminable proofs of geometric theorems that I had little use for.", "Helpfulness": 0.3333333333333333, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1TQG3QY9SLRGM"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Vector-Space-Approach-Geometry-Mathematics/product-reviews/0486404528/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.7 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$17.06", "Salesrank": "#649,332", "ListPrice": "$18.95"}
