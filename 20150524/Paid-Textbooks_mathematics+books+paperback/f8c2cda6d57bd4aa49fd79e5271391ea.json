I have read the text and have found it to be a very nice, straightforward read.  Series expansions to the roots of polynomials are covered and various techniques for solving differential equations are also introduced.  It is a great book and I highly recommend it!  The title accurately describes the text however: the book provides only a first look at these topics.  It is a great book for those like me who would like to get an idea about what perturbation theory is good for, but it is not appropriate for those looking for a thorough text.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3083GKY65TODX"}}, {"Date": "on October 5, 2014", "Text": "thanks", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2A0HXSCULB72W"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/First-Perturbation-Theory-Dover-Physics/product-reviews/0486675513/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$5.97", "Salesrank": "#209,574", "ListPrice": "$11.95"}
