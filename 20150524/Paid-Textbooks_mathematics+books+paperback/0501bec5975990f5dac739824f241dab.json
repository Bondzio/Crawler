Since it was written over 30 years or so back, it includes basic stuff, which is what  your advisor or lecturer at university \"expects\" you to know or understand without a problem (of course in reality nothing is easy unless one knows about it and this book, I feel, does provides those basic answers :o)", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3J5FVO3TJL6VZ"}}, {"Date": "on October 29, 2012", "Text": "great price, clean page, no scratch or any dirty spots, very good condition.
