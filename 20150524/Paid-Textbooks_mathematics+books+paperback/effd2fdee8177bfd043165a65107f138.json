It might be outdated, but that does in no way disqualify the content of a text.  As for learning calculus in order to understand relativity: I believe Einstein once said he could explain relativity (maybe he meant special relativity) to a barmaid.  Knowing calculus and differential geometry (for general relativity) would indeed provide one with a much deeper understanding of the theory, but one can get a good feel for the subject without it.  So if you are looking for a basic introduction to relativity don't discard this one for those reasons.  One good reason to choose this book is that it presents relativity in its natural context of electrodynamics, which really gives one a much clearer perspective, I believe.", "Helpfulness": 0.9375, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on January 4, 2007", "Text": "Dr. Einstein oft lamented that so few really understood his theories.  He said that perhaps there was one or maybe two people that understood.  It seems to me Max Born must be one of them.  His work simplifies as much as possible without sacrificing the level of knowledge needed to grasp the topic and begin to see its implications.  It is a complex topic but Max Born rises to the occasion to give us at least a glimpse into this important subject.", "Helpfulness": 0.9375, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AF3X7J0XC391L"}}, {"Date": "on May 24, 2009", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU"}}, {"Date": "on February 13, 2003", "Text": "This little book is a complete delight;  if you can only take one physics book to bed with you at night, this might be it.  Born reviews much of classical mechanics and E&M, and gives a great introduction to special relativity.

I am aware that Einstein's world view was different as his view of the cosmos was much smaller. In his day technology had not developed to view the cosmos and find trillions of Galaxies. They thought many of the sparking were stars; but in reality they were whole galaxies. With that view he projected other theories about space travel that were in error. Thus, one should examine his special theory of relativity as well.

For example, F=ma states that force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration.  Born uses K=bm, where K is force, b is  acceleration, and m is mass.  Huh?  Why?  I suggest that this book be  re-edited and updated to today's notation! 2)This book is for non calculus  students!  If you simply learn calculus (believe me, it's not hard!!)  you  wont have to run around the bush as this book does, in trying to dumben  down the physics.  After all, you DO want to learn relativity?  So learn  CALCULUS!! 3) This book offers a quasi-historical approach to physics,  showing the logic and thought processes behind the development of these  physics equations.  I liked that about the book.  This, however, does not  lend itself to learning, studying, and appplying relativity.  The book  shows how relativity and Newtonian physics came about.  It doesn't let you  apply what you've learned. To actually study Relativity, I suggest learning  calculus, purchasing physics and relativity books with worked problems and  questions, as well as purchasing a non mathematical treatment of  Relativity.", "Helpfulness": 0.55, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on September 7, 2010", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.2857142857142857, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A31COAJ9LR2DWO"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Einsteins-Theory-Relativity-Max-Born/product-reviews/0486607690/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.2 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$3.99", "Salesrank": "#92,308", "ListPrice": "$14.95"}
