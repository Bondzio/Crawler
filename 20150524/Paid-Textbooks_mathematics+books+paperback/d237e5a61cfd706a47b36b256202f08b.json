While this book is not \"Physics in One Simple Lesson,\" Walter Isaacson did a wonderful job of telling the story of the man and making the scientific aspects sufficiently understandable to be useful in grasping the magnitude of Einstein's intellect.  This book is meticulously researched and sourced, yet written in a witty and entertaining way that makes reading it a pleasure.  The central lesson that I was left with was the importance of independent thinking in any context.  Einstein made it clear that conventional wisdom is often neither practical, nor wise.  I was struck by his resiliance in his early years and his good humor in really tough times.  I also appreciated the fact that the author was willing to examine all aspects of Eintein's personality, both favorable and unfavorable.", "Helpfulness": 0.9633699633699634, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AVXGN90BU95P8"}}, {"Date": "on April 12, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.945054945054945, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AQP1VPK16SVWM"}}, {"Date": "on April 28, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9607843137254902, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2ZHB7E544QLLQ"}}, {"Date": "on January 13, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9340659340659341, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3KR9Q99D1EGEB"}}, {"Date": "on June 17, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9459459459459459, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AH1KJ45IQTM4T"}}, {"Date": "on May 29, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A39ABKRS1MKFTW"}}, {"Date": "on May 5, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9032258064516129, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A359U0JFFZ0Q04"}}, {"Date": "on April 15, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.92, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1L8HRCM60W0W7"}}, {"Date": "on May 5, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A680RUE1FDO8B"}}, {"Date": "on April 18, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9142857142857143, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A23US54A0OILE4"}}, {"Date": "on April 24, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9310344827586207, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2GBMNYVT040BE"}}, {"Date": "on April 19, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8974358974358975, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AE31M52VLKOG6"}}, {"Date": "on April 23, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9259259259259259, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1G37DFO8MQW0M"}}, {"Date": "on June 19, 2007", "Text": "With the 2006 release of the massive personal papers of Albert Einstein, the door was finally opened to the last remaining secrets of the life of the most renowned mathematician, scientist and quantum physicist of the 20th Century. By covering in great detail Einstein's entire life from his 1879 German childbirth to his passing from a bursting aneurysm in 1955 at age 76, Issacson has created a much broader understanding of the man, his pursuits and the often turbulent times in which he lived. Facing great dissent (including that of the anti-Semites) in the pre-war Germany of the 20's and 30's, the controversial and publicity seeking scientist is revealed to relish his often contrarian view of science, politics and society while at the same time becoming celebrated by the famous and politically powerful far beyond his country's borders. Einstein's motivations, dedication, creative phases and ultimate fame are all revealed in a finely detailed, cogent yet highly readable presentation that gives a new appreciation of the persona behind the discoveries of relativity, the expanding universe and unified theories. Beyond pure science, Isaacson explores his dedication to family, society and cultural Zionism which in 1932, just before Hilter's assent to Chancellor, ultimately lead to his relocation to Princeton University and the United States. Having covered such weighty literary ground as his recent biographies of big-thinkers like Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger, the former CNN chairman and Time magazine managing editor (where in 1999, Einstein was named 'Person of the Century') continues to build his case for being in a lofty league of serious contemporary authors in his own rite.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3L7LEJB9I7CFM"}}, {"Date": "on April 14, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8928571428571429, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A18LFU7UO4BH96"}}, {"Date": "on April 28, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A23LPQEL9YBGA4"}}, {"Date": "on June 24, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9333333333333333, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1J93EGDYK0IWA"}}, {"Date": "on June 4, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A14GK0E64J0WAS"}}, {"Date": "on May 9, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AQQLWCMRNDFGI"}}, {"Date": "on May 8, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1R4VHGGF1H23Y"}}, {"Date": "on August 23, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8823529411764706, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1ZTQFCL8ORC3Z"}}, {"Date": "on July 23, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3COJ370SPWHL0"}}, {"Date": "on July 16, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU"}}, {"Date": "on May 29, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2F6N60Z96CAJI"}}, {"Date": "on November 11, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9166666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1TM0Z207DMCZE"}}, {"Date": "on April 17, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A13E0ARAXI6KJW"}}, {"Date": "on May 14, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2G2MP8VLLATOR"}}, {"Date": "on May 20, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A10WVAH33PD2S3"}}, {"Date": "on April 17, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8421052631578947, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ASPJ8Z8WTPQEQ"}}, {"Date": "on July 4, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9090909090909091, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1WBIUQTR14CTG"}}, {"Date": "on July 26, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A252KC3NYOUQ1W"}}, {"Date": "on June 14, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1OBLTXJJ5ZHMA"}}, {"Date": "on October 3, 2007", "Text": "I am 75 years old and have read over a dozen books on Einstein and his work, including his own.

I think Isaacson's made an incredible effort here, but whereas you really felt he knew the guy in the Franklin book, it almost feels that with Einstein he's trying his hardest to be an \"insider\" in a crowd he really doesn't fit in with (for better or worse).  Consequently, he endlessly falls back to some very sweeping themes like \"Einstein always believed in independent thinking\" without really being able to articulate the nuances of those ideas in the context of a scientist.  He wants to have the comfort with Einsteing that he successfully built with the story of Franklin, but he never quite gets there.

I have very limited science and math background and was lost in some of the more technical explanations (scientists will love these parts) but it didn't bother me and I skipped these few places that befuddled my unscientific mind. Those who are interested in how quantum physics informs spiritual belief and practice will appreciate this book.

In the same way that Einstein fell short of a true unified theory (or so we think) the writer ultimately fails to bring together the myriad wavelengths of the inventor of e=mc(squared). While Isaacson is reasonably successful at explaining the Theory of Relativity to non-physicists he falls down when trying probe the depths of Einstein's motivations and decisions, especially later in life when the author treats his subject like a kindly, old, semi-deranged misanthrope. I also found his snide digs at other biographers unhelpful. Moreover, it is extremely hard to accept this biographer's contention that Einstein had completely lost his way in the study of Space and Time and spent the last 30 years of his life playing with inconsequential equations. The strongest parts of the book deal with Einstein's politics and roots of his pacifism.

Getting inside the mind of Albert Einstein beyond his scientific accomplishments is accomplished for the reader by author Walter Isaacson. Isaacson gives the reader a portrait of a uniquely curious, fascinating, and passionate man with high ideals for himself and humanity who was also detached at times at the expense of those close to him, fiercely independent, and marched to his own drummer even at personal and professional cost. Reading about Einstein making his way through society and his times were the most interesting part of this book for me. Besides his life as a thoretical physicist, Einstein was an active participant (on his own terms of course) and observer of the world around him as he strived to live a virtuous (my words, not his) life. Isaacson tells Einstein's life is told in the context of his times including the Europe around the turn of the 20th century, World War I, the rise of Communism and Nazism, World War II, the founding of the State of Israel, and McCarthyism.  No matter what the era, place, or ideology, Einstein tended to gently push the envelope of convention. He enjoyed his fame, but did not give in to his principles to obtain and keep it by going along with the wishes of governments, his scientific colleagues, and the prevailing political correctness. Einstein was very spiritual in his own way and spoke of God as \"the old one\" and believed the universe and its natural laws to be the product of some sort of divine design. His God was generally and impersonal God in the Deist sense.  Nevertheless, Einstein saw a divine presence in the laws of nature and his search for a \"Unified\" theory was partly based on how he thought God would set up the universe and its natural laws.  Although Isaacson concentrates on Einstein the man, he does not skimp on his scientific development, methods, and accomplishments. The book contains lengthy descriptions of Einstein's theories that sometimes became too complex and confusing for a generally scientific and mathematical illiterate such as me. Nevertheless, I did learn a lot and am glad to have been challenged and always had the option of skipping ahead. I am now reading Isaacson's biography of Benjamin Franklin. Although more different than alike, both men had a curiosity and sense of wonder that makes one realize why Isaacson dovetailed into a biography of Albert Einstein.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HRPFBYBZ4RJ5"}}, {"Date": "on December 24, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A8YGY02IDQKJ2"}}, {"Date": "on March 21, 2009", "Text": "Wonderfully informative and unbiased account.

Its main claim to fame, considering the many biographies of Al that have already been printed and sold, is that it reveals the newly uncensored letters and other material that the public was prevented from seeing. In short, it describes some of the 'dirt' that Al's friends and literary editors have concealed from the public. His coldness and mean-spirited treatment of his children reveal his almost reptilian affect where family relationships were involved.  For example, when he got his girlfriend pregnant and she gave birth to his illegitimate daughter, he refused to visit her or to even see his newborn baby. Instead, realizing that an illegitimate child would certainly damage his career potential, he gave orders to dump the baby into an orphanage. Much of the correspondence regarding this matter between Al and his girlfriend has been destroyed by the families. He pursued a similar coldness toward his legitimate son Eduard who was schizophrenic. He just refused to visit or see him and emotionally abandoned the child. I will say in Al's defense that he did provide financially for Eduard's upkeep in a mental institution in Switzerland. It is the revelation of the details of Al's personal life that make this book so interesting. It would be nice if even more personal information could be revealed such as the many infidelities with women that took place while he was married. These are hinted at but not described. The book has one annoying flaw which continues to irritate page after page. The author insists on using that pigeon-English expression \"thought experiment\" over and over again. The use of this ugly phrase seems to be required of Al's biographers as if de rigeur. It should be discarded once and for all. I notice that the index has no mention of Lieserl, Al's daughter. I guess the author also regards her as of no importance. One humorous note - the author claims he learned tensor calculus in order to write the book.

Isaacson presents a view into the soul of a great thinker and humanitarian, and although a nice man overall, at times he was a somewhat less than perfect husband, father, friend, or colleague, all backed up by clear, comprehensive research.  The emotional and spiritual quality of his struggle to complete and integrate quantum mechanics with our perceived reality is beautifully presented, as are the conflicts of his unstable family life, and the internal conflicts with his own unsteady faith and the social context of his time and place.

Walter Isaacson does this, but also with an emphasis on the roots of Einstein's genius.

In particular, Isaacson believes Einstein's natural curiosity and rebellious nature allowed him to reach breakthrough insights. Overall, the book is well written and accessible even for readers with no background in physics. My only regret is, despite Isaacson's repeated claim that \"Einstein's mistakes are more interesting than other people's successes,\" Isaacson never really explains Einstein's scientific mistakes. The first half of the book deals with Einstein's youth and physics theories, while the second half focuses almost exclusively on his politics. The second half barely even mentions his search for a unified field theory, much less try to explain his rationale. Instead, Isaacson retreads the claim that Einstein's latter years were wasted.

I won't have time to read books until I retire, but sometimes you just have to make exceptions.  Not only is the book researched incredibly well (see the vast list of persons that the author interviewed and/or asked to review portions of the manuscript - including the top experts in their fields to ensure that the theories/discoveries were accurately represented), it is told as a very personal story of another human being warts and all.  I discovered Einstein's sense of humor, especially with the Olympia Society that he and two lifelong friends created to mock the stuffy academic societies.  Einstein notes that after later being recruited by several of these societies, he and his friends were right on the mark.  Even the Time Magazine Person of the Century is just like you and me, and I admire him all the more because I now know the man.  And, I don't want to leave out the fact that Walter Isaacson takes you through Einstein's development of his theories - what triggered them in his head, the thought pictures that he used to work them out, and the events of his life that looked like they would stifle him - settling for being a Swiss Patent Examiner - that actually gave him the time and freedom of thought to work things out.  Finally, I enjoyed having the theories of General Relativity and Special Relativity presented in descriptive language I could understand, though certainly not in a condescending manner.

I attempted to read this book in 2008 and somewhere within the first two or three chapters I just gave up on it. More recently, I have read several positive reviews and I have decided that my first, flinched reaction might have been caused by the old \"kick-the-dog\" effect. Out of displaced anger, I often vicariously kick the ass of an unfortunate book. I'll wrongly declare and pathetically whine, \"...this book was just too hard for me\" or simply, \"...this book sucks!\" Did it really suck? I don't know, I jumped too early! Once I banish a book in a fit or in a funk, I rarely take it back. Einstien is an exception. This time around, I chose to listen to the unabridged audiobook and I'm sure glad I did. I doubt very much that I would have had the tenacity to physically skim through the cornerstones of quantum mechanics and general relativity that Einstien (and Isaacson) so clearly laid before us. As an audio book, Edward Herman (an exceptional orator) diligently marches on allowing the listener to painlessly phase out and phase back in to catch up with Einstein's next big life event. Issaacson's biography presents a colorful personal portrait of a true genius that changed mankind's understanding of the universe. Outside of Einstein brilliant mind and early accomplishment, he was just like the best and the worst of us. This was a fine book, but I must confess, if I physically read it, I would have whined about it.

It took me about a month to listen to all the 18 discs while driving to and from work, and at the end I felt an emotional separation from the writings of Walter Issacson -  a great writer with a sophisticated flare. Albert Einstein was a genius who defied dogmas, and rebelled against authorities, conventional wisdom and conformism.  Through his creativity and  intellect he gave the world  the postulates of the Theory of Relativity - many thought it as a radical concept at that time. Theory of Relativity was the greatest leap by mankind towards understanding the mysteries of the universe through relative motion, simultaneity, time dilation, length contraction and energy-mass equivalence, these are incomprehensible harmonious concepts. Time dilation led to the theoretical possibility of time travel and energy-mass equivalence (or e=mc2) led to the creation of atom-bomb, to which Einstein lamented. Einstein in no way participated in creation of the bomb, but had hand in the in pushing the US government to consider the creation of the bomb. With all his contributions that lead to the understanding of the universe, Einstein never received Nobel Prize for Theory of Relativity, but instead he received for his work in photoelectric effect (read the book for the politics behind this). He was a pacifist at early stages of his life, but gave up pacifism when he understood the threat posed by Nazis. Einstein was a socialist democrat, who believed in continual progression and restrained capitalism, and promoted world federalism throughout his life. He struggled to find tranquility in his personal life, his personal life was a roller-coaster ride from start to finish. My only critique of Einstein is his rejection of Neils Bohr's theory on the movement of electrons. Einstein rejected this idea by saying \"God does not play dice\". He did not believe in randomness, he believed that every action in the universe is governed by laws and patterns. Did Einstein become a conformist? While I did not understand some parts of the book that dealt with physics, I had a great pleasure in reading it and regret that i'm done reading it.", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AOXX69AY0R0FY"}}, {"Date": "on January 16, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1982SL9723QI"}}, {"Date": "on July 17, 2014", "Text": "Good book upon arrival, timing was good", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2C8O2JX3N68CC"}}, {"Date": "on October 4, 2010", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3HWNGA4VH2TR2"}}, {"Date": "on July 24, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1SP9F6VUVCQ0Y"}}, {"Date": "on October 19, 2014", "Text": "Great book.

WI does a superb job of describing Einstein the scientist and Einstein the man, and gives admirable account of Einstein's very abstruse scientific theories and discoveries.  In only one respect did I find EHLU disappointing: WI hews closely to his subject -- Einstein -- but touches only tangentially, in general, on Einstein's world.  World wars, the rise and fall of nations, etc., emerge only indistinctly from the pages of EHLU.  Of course, greater depth would have required a much longer treatment.  I, for one, would have been happy to read on, but I respect the strategy WI pursued in telling Einstein's story.  And what a story it is.  Einstein, genius, flaws, and all, will never cease to fascinate and inspire.  WI's account is honest and engaging.  It is also -- how could it be otherwise? -- reverent.

Some of the more interesting features of the book are Einstein's struggle with his unified field theory, a discussion of his concept of God, his disdain for the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics, and his ideas on peace. The last chapter deals with Einstein's brain: what happened to it and how it compares to other brains.

The author obviously understands the science and was able to describe physics and relativity in a way that this reader, a biologist, was able to understand. I would have liked more detail on Einstein's work in the decade 1905-1915, but I suppose the book might then have become unmanageably large. Details not in the text were often found in the notes, which were very helpful. I thought the episode with David Hilbert was somewhat appalling. Here we have Einstein giving a lecture on relativity and Hilbert, who was in the audience, then tries to scoop Einstein and beat him to the correct equations. Perhaps that was acceptable practice a century ago, or in the field of physics, but now to try to beat somebody out of credit for his or her own work would be seen as unethical.", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ADK7VC7CROJVC"}}, {"Date": "on July 4, 2014", "Text": "Enjoyed the insights", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24G7HUKPH2VRL"}}, {"Date": "on August 13, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.5, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AUIY58M1CIDBI"}}, {"Date": "on January 20, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2JTCMTEZ1N8IY"}}, {"Date": "on March 10, 2015", "Text": "It is Just WOW !", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A118GOQ15P7XT0"}}, {"Date": "on November 12, 2014", "Text": "Get.

Thomson, to Ernest Rutherford, to Lorentz transformation equations to list a few brilliant ideas that transform the modern physics, it took all to shape our understanding of our world. Einstein is known for his science, and we can not understand the man without full understanding of the true scientific zeitgeist of his time. This is where this biography falls short.
