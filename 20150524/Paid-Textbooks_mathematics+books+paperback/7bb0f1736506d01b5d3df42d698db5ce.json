I found it  by accident in a used book store in Madison, WI, in 1995 and found I  learned a lot from it, even though by that time I had already taken  multiple classes in Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Statistics,  etc.  Dr. Morrison really sets out in lucid detail many of the important  developments in applied modeling theory--dynamical systems, stochastic  systems, the fudamentals that lie behind them--from a very useful  perspective, and one that is often missing from the orthodox academic  treatments.  What he chooses not to cover in detail he references  thoroughly.  I wish that I had had this book when I was learning many of  the topics.  Anyone who is seriously considering learning dynamic modeling  should read this book and I have little doubt that fairly experienced  modelers will find something between the covers.", "Helpfulness": 0.9166666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on January 24, 2002", "Text": "This is the kind of book that should be available in every area of science and mathematics.  A book that is not a research book, but yet is not a broad popularization.  This book can benefit both persons who are just beginning a study of dynamic modeling and I dare say things will be learned by even those that are researchers in the area.  Good work Foster Morrison whoever you are.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AAI0DMQJDVJ1W"}}, {"Date": "on February 19, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A18L2CXEIBCQD5"}}, {"Date": "on November 22, 2001", "Text": "Very general overview for the subject of dynamic systems modeling, providing ample historical perspectives.

It asks you to casually re-examine the natural world and challenges you to come up with a way to view dynamic and interdependent systems mathematically. It explains the role of research and how to develop your own methods and approaches by keeping perspective with other disciplines. Truly a help in identifying relationships and attempting to express them mathematically.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24FSMNW5GZJZZ"}}, {"Date": "on January 20, 2001", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ANIHM0BW3ZWR3"}}, {"Date": "on October 23, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3QZC223RCG50J"}}, {"Date": "on July 9, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2QT8BI0QRI91E"}}, {"Date": "on December 25, 2014", "Text": "Modeling on statecraft was the dynamic I used and was quite successful.
