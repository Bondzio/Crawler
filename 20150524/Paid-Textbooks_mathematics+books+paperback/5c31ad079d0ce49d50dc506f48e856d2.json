It gave a concise coverage for each chapter. It didn't rely on mathematics or equations which makes it good for readers who aren't scientists. The only downside is there are a few unusual words due to the book's translation from French, but this can easily be solved by looking up the words in a dictionary. I would recommend this book to all readers interested in astrophysics and cosmology, only a basic background knowledge is required.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1286CNLNUTNV4"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Exploding-Superstars-Understanding-Supernovae-Gamma-Ray/product-reviews/0387095470/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$16.07", "Salesrank": "#1,195,953", "ListPrice": "$29.95"}
