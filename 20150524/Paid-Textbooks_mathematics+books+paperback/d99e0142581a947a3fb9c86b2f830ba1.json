Some of my commercial products contain simple Kepler solvers and orbit integrators that began life in BMW. Compared to other books in this field, it's a deceptively easy read. But I know of at least one rocket destroyed by engineers ignorant of the basics in sections 9.5 and 9.6. Sure, it leaves out chaos and I really wish it used SI rather than imperial units (actually, it favors canonical units, a useful and units-agnostic concept).

An unfortunate number of them were written by people who, while they may know their subject, are not skilled at teaching.

This book is not like that.  The authors (Bate, Mueller and White) start from fundamentals and proceed slowly and steadily to build on them in a logical fashion. The book contains exercises that (wonder of wonders) actually added to my understanding of the material.  The authors clearly have experience teaching this subject and seemed to have an intuitive grasp of exactly where I would have trouble understanding, whereupon they would offer a little extra extra explanation or some coaching about the math or even (wow) a discussion about the physical implications of a mathematical equation they had derived.
