This book is perfect if you have a good understanding of linear algebra as well as  optimal control theory. Some of the proposed problems are (I remember the  headaches) of high dificulty but having the book along with some good  papers written by the autors, makes them much easier. Because of the  dificulty of the subject, I read several other books and none was better  that this so if you really want to learn Linear Robust Control and care  about mathematic rigurousity, this is the book for you. It is best suited  as a companion for a course in robust control since the book is not easy at  all.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3ONF9JIGAO9D8"}}, {"Date": "on August 3, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1O8EAT165MSHM"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Robust-Control-Electrical-Engineering/product-reviews/0486488365/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.5 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$24.05", "Salesrank": "#1,003,062", "ListPrice": "$29.95"}
