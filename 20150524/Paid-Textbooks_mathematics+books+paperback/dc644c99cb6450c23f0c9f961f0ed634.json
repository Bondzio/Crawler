This book goes into much greater detail and merits a gradual reading by non-scientists like myself. The Preface is a clear introduction to the issues. The next section, Overture, is intentionally overwhelming with its \"Greatest Story Ever Told.\" If you are not frustrated by this chapter, you know a lot more about physics than I do! Ah, but that is the point. Hang in there, because the rest of the book explains the Overture, one topic at a time. I am reading part of a chapter each day at lunch and find something amazing each day. This is a good book for people who want to challenge their assumptions about reality.", "Helpfulness": 0.9722222222222222, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A331YM8BT7ZOBC"}}, {"Date": "on September 17, 2004", "Text": "\"Origins\", Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Donald Goldsmith's new book, subtitled -the search for ourselves in the universe, has attempted much in tackling the real `biggest story ever told'. It is largely successful. It presents a general survey of cosmologic history from the `big bang' through the formation of galaxies, planets, and life with most of the emphasis on the earliest period. All of this is accomplished almost entirely without math, with some humor, and is a good starting point for the high school or college undergraduate student without a scientific background. It presents a more detailed scientific picture with less `wonder' than the late Carl Sagan's \"Cosmos\" but some readers may want more depth. For those I would recommend Steven Weinberg's \"The First Three Minutes\", or from the biologist's viewpoint, Morowitz's \"The Emergence of Everything\" which starts with the `big bang' and continues the story step-wise to explain complexity and emergence. For the general reader \"Origins\" presents an introduction to much mind-opening material including the mysterious `dark matter', isotropism, discussions about the curvature of space-time and the inflationary model of the universe that has the potential to stimulate further study or simply be enjoyed for itself.", "Helpfulness": 0.8703703703703703, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2C4EDQ54BJ6OQ"}}, {"Date": "on September 30, 2004", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9230769230769231, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1M8PP7MLHNBQB"}}, {"Date": "on November 21, 2004", "Text": "This book was fantastic in terms of it's scope and presentation of astrophysics.

I am surprised how many people love Dawkins's fairytales and billions of years that gives us such an awe of `mother' nature. We can't help to have some deep religious awe of nature; we just want to bow down before nature and `science so called' to guide us into the unknown future. We want to cover our ignorance of the universe with deep religious faith that what we have in front of us is billions of years old. Now stop the bus for a moment and watch Age of the Earth by Kent Hovind and that lie suddenly explodes in ones face like a big bang. After reading John Hartnett's book, `Dismantling the big bang', one cannot but feel betrayed by Scientific America, National Geographic, Your Lecturer at university, etc for changing the age of the universe from 5 billion to 10 billion to 20 billion years to accommodate their false religion of evolution and their ever changing `scientific theorems'.  And what does the average McDonalds eating, soap opera watching non thinking person do? He accepts it as `science' because after all, naturalistic `science' is the end all of all knowledge and modern science fits right in with the `God is dead movement'. One can see how this religion of evolution and its evil twin, atheism has managed to fly through under the radar of `science'. 99% of people hate the God of the bible and will believe any fairytale rather than God!

But if nonlife is the cause of structure formation in the universe, it ought to be demonstrated that at one time life did not exist, or that nonlife on its own - i.e. in the total absence of life - can generate life. The authors do not even attempt to make that point. So their unconditional bias in favor of nonlife's imagined self-organizing capabilities is most evident. They maintain this bias in face of the fact that in our experience structure formation is the basic quality of life and not that of nonlife. So instead of rehashing cosmology's divorced-from-reality mathematical models, on my part I would be delighted to see what makes them think that life did not play an intimate part in the creation of the universe. It is evident beyond any reasonable doubt that the cosmic system yields life, and it is equally evident that in our experience any natural system that yields life is itself the product of life. To illustrate my point with nature's model: over 97 percent of a giant Sequoia' mass is considered to be dead, yet it yields leaves, flowers, and millions of tiny winged seeds. We know it yields seeds as its output because a seed generated that tree structure for the purpose of self-reproduction. What makes the authors believe that the universe is the sole exception to this most basic principle of nature? Or did they manage to refute, without our knowledge, the principles of biogenesis and causality? (Namely that life comes only from life akin to itself and can never originate from nonlife, and that a cause cannot produce an effect superior to itself because the difference between the cause and the superior effect would have to come from nothing.) Only when they can refute these principles of nature should we join them in the celebration of nonlife's incredible creative potentials. In the meantime we should study nature's life-giving systems and based on those observations infer that the universe yields life because the cosmic system itself is the product of life. Since that initial seed or genotype of the phenotype universe is both the input and the output of the universe, the authors and the rest of the pro-nonlife cosmologists ignore its existence. After all the seed or final cause of the universe exists beyond the self-imposed limitations of science, and those who remain in that box will pretend it does not exist. Metaphorically speaking, it is like the seeds of a giant Sequoia pretending that the seed which created their tree for the purpose of self-reproduction does not exist. Instead of ending with the search for extraterrestrial life, the book should begin with the realization that life is immortal, which immortal life created the universe for the production of life in its own image. I recommend the book for those readers who want to embrace and to worship nonlife as the creator of the universe, and want to read more about the mushrooming crank theories that posit multiple hidden dimensions and universes. On the other hand this book is definitely not for \"out of the box\" thinkers, or for rational thinkers.", "Helpfulness": 0.09090909090909091, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3U4JLRZTXHFM"}}, {"Date": "on December 28, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2L1KC5CTPF9UD"}}, {"Date": "on April 12, 2012", "Text": "Why do so-called scientists continue to preach their unproven religion?
