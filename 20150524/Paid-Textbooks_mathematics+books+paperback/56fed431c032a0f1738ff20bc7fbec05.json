It is not a textbook by any stretch of the imagination. There are no equations, analyses of operation, or vector-space drawings as you would find in modern mechanical engineering textbooks. However, as an idea book for mechanical engineers at its very low cost it cannot be beat. The Amazon title page says it is copyrighted 1995. However, the book was written in 1868 and its content remains unchanged from that date of publication. The language is therefore flowery and somewhat archaic as you can see from the book's complete title: \"Five Hundred and Seven Mechanical Movements, Embracing All Those Which Are Most Important In Dynamics, Hydraulics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Steam Engines, Mill and other Gearing, Presses, Horology, and Miscellaneous Machinery: and including Many Movements Never Before Published and Several Which Have only Recently Come into Use\". The book's format is quite simple: On one page you will see 8-10 drawings of mechanical devices. On the opposite page you will have a paragraph or so each describing those 8-10 mechanical devices. If there are any equations being spelled out it is done via prose, so you may need paper and pencil in hand to write in equation form what the author is telling you about the theory of operation. I think it functions well both as a history book for mechanical engineers and as a source of ideas of how mechanical devices can be combined to create more complex machines. I highly recommend it, as long as you understand what you are getting.", "Helpfulness": 0.9583333333333334, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2E3F04ZK7FG66"}}, {"Date": "on March 14, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8181818181818182, "StarRating": "1", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1D3T5RNKOCAMM"}}, {"Date": "on July 19, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9411764705882353, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A276AFN1BZB09U"}}, {"Date": "on June 17, 2000", "Text": "This book is around for a reason, even though it is old.
