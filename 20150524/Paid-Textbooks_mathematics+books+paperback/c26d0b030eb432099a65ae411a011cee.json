As it is true of the other great books by Weyl, this is not an easy book, but it is, by all means, accessible. Don't try to read it in front of the TV set. Get pencil and paper, put yourself in a calm and contemplative mood and patiently read the words of the master. Hermann Weyl, one of the great minds of the 20th century, wrote this book with utmost care to make it self-contained. Sometimes you have to be deep in order to be brief, so the book requires some thought. But the main ideas are all there, and the connection of group theory with quantum mechanics has here its best treatment, in my humble opinion. But in less humble too: this was the only book concerning physics which Enrico Fermi read as a grown up. Once, Max Born had to write a synthetic exposition of Quantum Mechanics. After he finished it, he saw, for the first time, this book, and Weyl's synthesis of QM. He felt depressed by the superiority of Weyl's text. The book was originally written in German, but the translation is excellent, due to the great American cosmologist H. P. Robertson, of Robertson-Walker fame.", "Helpfulness": 0.975609756097561, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3D7XC7USJ9X7J"}}, {"Date": "on June 27, 2000", "Text": "Although published by Dover in 1984, this book dates back to about 1930, when Weyl was the big proponent of group theory in quantum mechanics. Because of this date, much of what modern books on group theory would  include, is absent from the book. It mainly discusses the permutation  group. The book is, however, of historic interest, as Weyl (mathematician)  tried to convince the physicists to exploit group theory - which even gave  rise to some irritation (\"group pest\").", "Helpfulness": 0.9565217391304348, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on February 26, 2003", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9411764705882353, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3EQQP0LD4Z375"}}, {"Date": "on November 7, 2001", "Text": "This is my favorite introduction to quantum mechanics.

Everyone who wants study a deeper view of quantum mechanics, in his intrinsic mathematical formulation, should read this work. After a firt brief introduction to quantum theory, he passes to explain the theory of rapresentation of groups, and its physical application, like the rotation group, or Lorentz group, and finally the theory of simmetry. It's a fundamental book for a good understandig of the importance of simmetries in modern physics.
