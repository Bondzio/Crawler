This is a brave attempt, however the  exposition contains many mathematical mistakes in the form of claims that are false. A example of this is the pervasive confusion between closed and compact, a mistake which makes the relevant theorems wrong as stated. A less damaging problem is the tangental to disconnected material in each section. These tangents are hardly  related to the topic.", "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A36KS9O0VIFIN2"}}, {"Date": "on April 28, 2000", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3RRVSBVYAJJ9W"}}, {"Date": "on January 14, 2004", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0"}}, {"Date": "on September 10, 2007", "Text": "While I think that this is one of the best introductory texts with regard to twentieth century mathematics, a person has to be willing to spend some significant time studying some of the chapters in order to make any sense out of it.  I understood the Minimax and Halting Theorem chapters because I'm familiar with the material, but the rest of it was a little over my head for the amount of time I was willing to invest.  I think that if you are really into math, this book will seem too simple, and if you aren't, it won't seem valuable.

On one level, the material is fascinating.  At another, you have to be impressed with Casti's ability to compress complex subjects into short essays.  I've never seen anything comparable.  Casti's presentation of game theory and topology are audacious.  I've spent a lot of time with the 'Halting Problem' and disagree with a variety of conclusions Casti draws, but the clarity of presentation makes it a 'must read'.", "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AFVBYTVP8C4LW"}}, {"Date": "on March 12, 2013", "Text": "Casti really knows his stuff and is able to convey the underpinnings and applications of 5 interesting and fundamental topics. Not for the casual reader but for someone with a love of mathematical concepts and not just glorified bookkeeping.
