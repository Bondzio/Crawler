Over 350 pages covering literally hundreds of cases of \"what went wrong\" with launchers, satellites, missions, instruments, designs, and procedures from the 1940s to the present.  It is well written, entertaining, highly educational, and can be read in many short sittings since the average incident description is about one page long.  The book not only covers what went wrong, but in many cases also what was done to fix it.  \"Space Systems Failures\" is a valiant and perhaps unequaled attempt to preserve institutional memory and the lessons learned, often at great price, by the world's space programs.", "Helpfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A26QUAP2SERRWB"}}, {"Date": "on March 14, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AG35NEEFCMQVR"}}, {"Date": "on February 20, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1VEJ0PAM9XN5D"}}, {"Date": "on January 4, 2014", "Text": "As many other reviewers have noted, this book goes into great detail to describe failures that occurred in many space missions, failures that involved everything from catastrophic booster failure to simple blown fuses. To be honest, I found most of these to be rather boring, and even the more dramatic were presented in a dry fashion. Moreover, as some have noted, there is only a feeble attempt to generalize these experiences and draw insightful conclusions about them. There are some interesting tidbits that can be extracted from a brisk read-through, but not much in the way of enlightenment.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AZC562U18BK2S"}}, {"Date": "on September 23, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2FWTNH24D1PPQ"}}, {"Date": "on March 28, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A32A6AQJR9ZUJ"}}, {"Date": "on March 1, 2013", "Text": "Lessons learned from past missions are extremely useful.
