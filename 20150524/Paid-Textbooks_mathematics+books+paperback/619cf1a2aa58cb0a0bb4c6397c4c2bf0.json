As for system identification, especially of linear systems, it is a useful introductory text. The main concepts and basic model structures and estimators are presented. The author trades a rigorous mathematical presentation for a more informal style. The author always tries to appeal to the reader's common sense and basic knowledge of dynamical systems and statistics. Many students found this book helpful as an introductory text (and that is what is promissed in the title). For deeper studies and to gain a better theoretical basis -- which is a must in the field -- the reader should look elsewhere.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2P0PRYHOAJ161"}}, {"Date": "on September 6, 2014", "Text": "great book.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AZ0U89818WFYW"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Identification-Dover-Electrical-Engineering/product-reviews/0486469352/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.0 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$15.82", "Salesrank": "#1,121,911", "ListPrice": "$16.95"}
