It contains all the information necessary to properly design a solar passive house.  The only negative is that it is 1979 Copyright, out of print, and may therefore be hard to acquire.  The best current book that we have is by Daniel D. Chiras, \"The Solar House\".  James Kachadorian's \"The Passive Solar House\" is also an excellent current book in terms of the excellent engineering information provided although some of the slab construction recommendations may be somewhat dated and not in line with current best practice.  The worst book we have encountered was Debra Coleman's \"Sun Inspired House\".  This book is merely an advertisement of the plans she sells and we would definitely advise applying due diligence if considering to do business with her.  For those interested in doing passive solar design, we added some calculators to our website that you can find by Googling Borst Engineering & Construction LLC.", "Helpfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1283LGIL2T6VL"}}, {"Date": "on February 1, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A377RTU25E4T6V"}}, {"Date": "on December 7, 2010", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3DJV0J3JWZJPY"}}, {"Date": "on April 24, 2013", "Text": "One of my favorite books on passive solar...very complete,useful information, temperature performance and rules of thumb on relation of thermal mass and glass area etc.....and thanks god the book is written in a down to earth style and not overloaded with useless equations such as in Kreidler's books on active solar systems. that book is a must have....and bearing in mind that you get that marvel of a book used for less than 10c it should be punished not having a copy!!", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2ZSYJ3DABTLII"}}, {"Date": "on August 11, 2014", "Text": "If you are designing a house this is a must for the basics in Passive Solar.
