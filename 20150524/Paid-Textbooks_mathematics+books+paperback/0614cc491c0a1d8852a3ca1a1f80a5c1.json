It generalizes far too much. It gives too little detail. It reminds me of an outline for a scattering text book. It is a reference text in the truest sense of the word. It's obvious intent is a reminder for those who already know the information, but it is so generalized...it alone is not very useful for the student learning scattering.", "Helpfulness": 0.5, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3OCEDH49YY8KA"}}, {"Date": "on January 3, 2015", "Text": "Excellent.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2390WJBHTIFMJ"}}, {"Date": "on April 23, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A26BOCSG2AIHY9"}}, {"Date": "on March 26, 2015", "Text": "good", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1BIZHO3UANMNS"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Light-Scattering-Small-Particles-Physics/product-reviews/0486642283/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.6 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$14.01", "Salesrank": "#158,389", "ListPrice": "$16.95"}
