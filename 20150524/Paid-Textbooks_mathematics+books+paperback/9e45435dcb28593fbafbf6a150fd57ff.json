Even though it is not a long book, it covers a lot of material, but it focuses on giving a general overview and conceptual understanding rather than long proofs.  Some parts of the book are more thorough then others, so I would recommend supplementing with additional readings.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2VP9941AW5G24"}}, {"Date": "on September 2, 2013", "Text": "This book is a great, semi-formal approach to PDEs. Was used in a PDE class during my undergrad, and I would recommend it for anyone interested in sharpening up their PDE skills. It has many nice applications to the sciences (many biology examples).
