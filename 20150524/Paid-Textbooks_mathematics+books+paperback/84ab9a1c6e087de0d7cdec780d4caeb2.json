Speaking as an engineer, I found it  not as intuitive as I had hoped (I'm more mathematically-oriented than most  engineers) However, the book is clearly written and develops the arguments  in small steps. Recommend it as helpful, but perhaps supplemented by more  careful development.", "Helpfulness": 0.9428571428571428, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3B16TNKAC08RQ"}}, {"Date": "on April 6, 2009", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2Z17Y2C4C704S"}}, {"Date": "on September 20, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2AJU5YX5CXB7O"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Transforms-Springer-Undergraduate-Mathematics/product-reviews/1852330155/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.7 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$34.79", "Salesrank": "#872,987", "ListPrice": "$49.95"}
