It's truly written in a manner that's not heavily mathematical, but without losing any technical soundness or being anecdotal. Instead, the author expertly explains the consequence equations have on the practical design of electric machines and drives, the reasons for the design techniques of today's electric machines and drives, and how to analyze and make assessments for the selection of electric machines and drives. This new update includes a new chapter for field-oriented control used in VFD's. I think it's a worthwhile update to the 3rd edition, but the author sacrifices end of chapter problems for the addition of that chapter. Now, this book has no problems that one can practice, a very unfortunate thing! I don't know why he did it, if but he felt that the publishing costs would be too high with having to print too many extra pages or if he didn't want to develop new problems for the new VFD chapter. I would encourage him at least to bring back the problems for the other chapters in a reprint of this edition! However, the overall book is still excellent and the additional chapter is definitely a must for anyone wanting to understand fully how VFD's work. Overall, I highly recommend this book for an engineer, technician, or student.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1294XJ37QQD5M"}}, {"Date": "on September 1, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1RDKJWXHD73TI"}}, {"Date": "on December 7, 2013", "Text": "This book is informative and good.
