The contents have completely been revised to reflect the changes in the commercial spaceflight industry. Very helpful are the Suborbital and Orbital Ground School Manuals - the first in the industry. Extremely thorough and authoritative. A must-read for anyone contemplating buying a ticket or are just interested in how space tourists will be trained.
