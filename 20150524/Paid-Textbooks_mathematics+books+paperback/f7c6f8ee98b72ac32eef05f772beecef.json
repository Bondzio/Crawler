The stories are in the form of an article so they are to the point and not too long. I use this in my one on one tutor class and it is a great jumping off point for further conversation.  But the absolute best part is when my student's eyes light up when he finally can make sense of a phrase he has been hearing in conversations.  We have cleared up so many simple language stumbling blocks with this book,  it has given both of us a feeling of accomplishment. I would highly recommend this book for someone with basic English language skills.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A15IFACWTC8Q0V"}}, {"Date": "on July 31, 2010", "Text": "The book was in perfect conditions as advertised.
