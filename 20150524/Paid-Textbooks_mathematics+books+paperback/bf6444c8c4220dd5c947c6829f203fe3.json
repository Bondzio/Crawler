This is an old subject,  many treatises have been written about it,  so  what more can one expect from yet  another  monograph?  I would say, that this book  offers you  Donaldson's perspective on the subject, always  superbly  clear and efficient,  informed by the author's own  extensive experience, and  revealing the depths of the subject with an ease that would  make  Fred Astaire jealous.  It has  a  geometric bias and it brings you from zero to where modern research  begins.  This is a good place to start if you want to learn about this subject that  branches out into  many other areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.", "Helpfulness": 0.8846153846153846, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2D1IZSOMFP7IW"}}, {"Date": "on December 20, 2014", "Text": "Excellent.", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ACI4R265T3MP8"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Riemann-Surfaces-Oxford-Graduate-Mathematics/product-reviews/0199606749/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$46.92", "Salesrank": "#264,168", "ListPrice": "$55.00"}
