The word Cosmos itself, derived from ancient Greek, implies the deep interconnectedness of all things, in which we all play a part. Although it was written over two decades ago, and therefore you may think that it may not be so relevant in its facts today, its underlying dual-purposes, to educate and to inspire, remain just as relevant as ever. It serves as an introduction to science, and the late Carl Sagan, one of the great humanists of our time, does an excellent job in bringing us into that world by not presenting simply hard facts and technobabble. Instead, he tries to make the book accessible to the scientific novice, and shows how it is relevant to every aspect of our daily lives. And we learn about the development of human understanding, not only in terms of 'Where did we come from?' and 'How did the universe get created?', but the development of ourselves, as people who began our existence from the most humble of beginnings, and were intelligent enough to ask ourselves 'Who are we?' and of course 'Why are we here?'. He shows why science is not only relevant to us here and now, but how it can help us to understand the future, and in the final chapter, he makes it clear that through the rampant destruction of our environment, that future may not be so long-reaching as we might dream it. Sagan manages to gently educate us in a stylish and entertaining way, and his book Cosmos leaves us feeling richer for the experience. I certainly recommend this to anyone.

He asks and answers many questions I have had about the universe beyond Earth, and proposes many theories and scenarios that he wishes he knew more about. He writes in a way that every reader can understand, even when the subject is a terribly complex problem that only the greatest astronomers have dared to tackle. This trait as well as his own curiosity, make the reader feel comfortable and assured even if they will never be more than hopelessly amatuer astronomers. Aside from the broad exploration of the Cosmos, Sagan makes interesting cases for the advancement of knoledge and peace on Earth and takes fascinating tangents  that are very thought provoking.

I recently read the book based on the series, which covers the same basic material but without (as Sagan points out in the introduction) being a transcript.  Still, the book captures the distinctive voice and language that Sagan used while narrating the TV series.  Although some of the science is now dated- for instance, the Big Bang is now believed to have happened about 13.7 billion years ago, rather than the \"fifteen to twenty billion years ago\" that Sagan cites- the book essentially focuses on the history of science and stays general enough to stay relevant and interesting.  Sagan is also careful enough as a scientist and writer to add qualifications to his statements and point out scientific uncertainties.  On the whole, the book is still a readable classic of popular science, especially if you're nostalgic for the TV show (without wanting to pay for the boxed set of DVDs).  One can, of course, argue with some of Sagan's optimistic view of science: he see science as essentially a force for good that has only been corrupted by superstition and mysticism, rather than seeing it as a morally neutral technique that can inherently be used for either good or evil.  But his outlook motivates his enthusiasm for the subjects he covers and adds to the spirit of the book (and yes, Sagan is fascinated by vast quantities and refers frequently to things like \"billions upon billions\" of stars and galaxies).", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AKI8VJIO9GF4M"}}, {"Date": "on January 27, 2007", "Text": "What more can be said about this book which hasn't already been said?

For  one thing, the more enlightened the general public, the more chance for  mutual survival. Furthermore, science does not function solely in an ivory  tower; it coexists in a wider world with many people who could be made to  appreciate the genuine wonders.  It is to the author's credit that he  realizes this, which many other \"pure\" scientists of the same ilk  (Sagan certainly knew his \"hard science\" too) would be well to  observe.

The 13-part series, which has now been seen by over half a billion people, aside from introducing many people to science, was also enormously influential - can one imagine the success of the modern Discovery Channel and its ilk (actual 24-hour science networks) without Sagan? Hardly. Undoubtedly, many of the leading figures in science today would credit Sagan with introducing them to the field in the first place. Perhaps even more importantly, however, Sagan did that incredible, seemingly almost impossible thing: he interested the average layman in science. Whether he was a \"real\" (whatever that means) scientist or not, as some refuse to concede, is totally beside the point: what he accomplished was monumental, and he should be given the credit he deserves. Many supposedly open-minded individuals would keep science esoteric and its knowledge among the hands of an elite few; Sagan not only pointed out why this is wrong, but also devoted his life to vigorously seeing that it never became so. This book is remarkable in that it explain many difficult and far-reaching concepts in relatively simple terms that most people will be able to understand - and even enjoy. Unlike many college textbook authors, Sagan, for the most part, keeps his personal biases out of the writing, and he rarely gets overly technical. This is truly a book that all can enjoy. There are many photographs and quotes strewn throughout the book as well, to pep up interest in the text. This is a great general, all-around book on science for the layman: truly a \"Science For Dummies.\" And, unfortunately, this book is often pigeonholed as a book solely on astronomy (the section in which you're likely to find it at bookstores), but don't let the title fool you: this book at least touches on all the major aspects of science, as well as quite a bit of history. Evolution is given a clear and concise overview, genetics is more than touched upon - and Sagan even induldges in a bit of the social sciences. However, the book, unfortunately, does grow less interesting towards the end, where Sagan uses the text to push his own agendas (radio astronomy, later the basis of his excellent science fiction novel, Contact; and a dated plea for peace in the nuclear arms race, which, though commendable and worthy, now smacks a little too highly of Cold War paranoia.) All in all, though, this is an excellent, highly interesting, and immensely readable book that works very well as introduction to the science (in particular, astronomy) for the common man, as well as guiding him towards that all-important virtue: open-mindedness. Along with Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time and some (unfortunately) long-out-of-print books from Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, this is perhaps the best type book of its kind.
