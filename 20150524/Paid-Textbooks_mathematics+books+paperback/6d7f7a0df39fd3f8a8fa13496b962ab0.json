I couldn't be happier to discover this book. It does require a grade 8 level of algebra, Geometry and trigonometry and does not expect you be math wiz!. If you don't have a grade 8 level of math then work on math first. Mathematics made simple is a recommendation, covers to about grade 10. Physics made simple does not mean mathematically ignorant.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2GA3YDAPFWIWX"}}, {"Date": "on July 28, 2007", "Text": "i love this book it is by far the best book i found.that makes this very interesting subject easy to understand.i never took a school course in physics .yet i was able  to complete the book in about a week  and completely understand all the concepts.the book made physics really easy and fun.now that i finished this book i will better understand other books on physics.i hope many other people get to enjoy this book.", "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1DUWXYTZL7HEA"}}, {"Date": "on January 16, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AQUCXBJDH9JX3"}}, {"Date": "on May 7, 2013", "Text": "This book is an easy read and answers a lot of questions that I had about how things worked.
