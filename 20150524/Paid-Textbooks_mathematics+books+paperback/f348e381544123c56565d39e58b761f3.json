It was easy to read and understand by the average person with an interest in astro physics. It doesn't boggle down one's mind with the math.  I think it's a book that everyone with an interest in this field should read.

It explains the consequences of asymmetries in nature and how the underlying symmetries are broken. I learnt quite a bit as to how it operates in biological systems.
