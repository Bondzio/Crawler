I used this at UC San Diego for a year long graduate  course on Mathematical methods in physics and engineering.  If one has the  time, there is really a lot to be gained by carefully studying this book. A  big part of the book is geared toward developing in detail the mathematics  of the Quantum Theory. This is a good thing because in my experience most  QM books are too eager to \"get to the physics\". It is true that  you can get by with a superficial understanding of functional analysis and  still do QM, but this book will give you an immensely deeper understanding  of the underlying structure of the theory.  In particular, the  treatment of Green's functions and integral equations is good. There is  chapter on Group Theory and it's uses in QM. Also is a chapter on Complex  analysis, although it is a wise idea to read a book entirely devoted to  this subject. Overall, I like this book very much.", "Helpfulness": 0.9818181818181818, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HX6QSV6BDYVR"}}, {"Date": "on September 27, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9666666666666667, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A336IIPVQMGQGG"}}, {"Date": "on May 29, 2003", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.911504424778761, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3CKCIKPTQTZRH"}}, {"Date": "on November 10, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.9642857142857143, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3D4Z9QQ6F06QI"}}, {"Date": "on January 11, 1999", "Text": "This book has in-depth info on some of the topics that get less attention than they  deserve in other physics texts, such as  integral equations and hilbert space.
