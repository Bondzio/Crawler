However, the level of detail and rigor can obscure the main ideas, and so it is a very difficult  introductory text for readers without a strong background in probability  theory and continuous Markov processes.  As a teaching assistant in a  Mathematical Finance Masters program, I recommend that my students read  Oskendal's Stochastic Differential Equations first, which gives an  excellent introduction to the material without sacrificing rigor.", "Helpfulness": 0.9247311827956989, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on June 17, 2001", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7941176470588235, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3EQQP0LD4Z375"}}, {"Date": "on January 14, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.85, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2MLYJZDTJMPHL"}}, {"Date": "on September 1, 1999", "Text": "Before young talents try to prove themselves in this area they must know what is known...
