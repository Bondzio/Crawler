It is accessible to anyone with a bachelor's degree in computer science,  mathematics, engineering, or physics.  It is also accessible to others with  a few years of math courses.  Lattice gasses and lattice boltzmann machines  are the natural extensions of cellular automata such as the game of life.", "Helpfulness": 0.8571428571428571, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A11W1GDAHPGPJY"}}, {"Date": "on May 6, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A44BIDH5E0KNK"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Lattice-Gas-Cellular-Automata-Lattice-Boltzmann/product-reviews/3540669736/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.5 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$59.75", "Salesrank": "#1,650,441", "ListPrice": "$79.95"}
