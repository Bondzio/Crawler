Each book essentially consists of a number of NASA documents printed for the  media that describe details of the flight (e.g., the Press Kit).  Separately, the original documents contained in these books would cost  hundreds of dollars.  Reprints of individual press kits alone would cost as  much as the price of this book.  The only problem is the poor reproduction  of many of the black and white figures.  They were obviously scanned--and  often at low resolution.  The important information is still there,  however, and it shouldn't detract from their value as a reference.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on March 9, 2000", "Text": "Reading these Apogee books is like leafing through a thick stack of mimeographs.

For example,  a big cut-away diagram of the first stage rocket showing fuel delivery system and nozzles.  Also,  complete launch sequence.  The biggest disappointment  was the fact that the whole book consists of pre-mission reports,  and only  the very briefest post-mission report.  Where are the post-mission reports?  Also disappointing is the fact that one report is almost identical to  another!  Some of the reports were scanned in,  and so contain frequent  spelling errors.
