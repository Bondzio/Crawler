It's become something of a classic it its time, and I think this is well deserved, since it is written with a good flow and clarity and also covers everything a nonspecialist in nuclear physics would ever need to know (and provides a good basis for those who are specialists). The Dover edition is nice and also inexpensive. I would highly recommend it as a reference for all physics and chemistry people.", "Helpfulness": 0.9090909090909091, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ARSGAWB8YU6ZG"}}, {"Date": "on June 18, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A30OS3RBR592DE"}}, {"Date": "on July 6, 2006", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AG35NEEFCMQVR"}}, {"Date": "on July 27, 2013", "Text": "I bought this for my grandson.
