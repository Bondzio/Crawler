I have been a fan of Angry Birds since I bought Angry Birds for 3DS and I have been a fan of Star Wars since I was a child. This book had beautiful and funny pictures. In this book, this book explains the difference between Sci-Fi and Reality. This book had all of the Angry Birds as Star Wars characters and this book explains everything that we do not have in the Star Wars world like the robots we have are almost similar to the droids in Star Wars, the space suits we have are almost similar to Darth Vader's armor, even a blowtorch that is almost similar to a lightsaber and many more. I gave this Angry Birds book a 5 star rating and I recommended this to Star Wars fans.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JYATWK5TZ089"}}, {"Date": "on February 16, 2014", "Text": "My son loves angry birds, especially angry birds star wars.
