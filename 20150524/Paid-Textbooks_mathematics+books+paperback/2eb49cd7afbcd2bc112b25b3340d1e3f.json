Instead, it is an elegant analysis of antenna  radiation and the associated problems of electromagnetic propagation in a  plasma and the Doppler effect.  It will appeal to every applied physicist.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A26BKV6R6XFJT6"}}, {"Date": "on September 14, 2011", "Text": "\"Theory of Electromagnetic Wave Propagation\" by Charles H. Papas is an extremely fine but relatively little known text on several important topics in electromagnetics: 1) the electromagnetic field, 2) radiation from monochromatic sources in unbounded regions, 3) radiation from wire antennas, 4) multipole expansion of the radiated field, 4) radio-astronomical antennas, 6) electromagnetic waves in a plasma, and 7) the Doppler effect. Papas' presentation of all these topics is very lucid. It is not a general textbook on electromagnetics but there is much to be learned from the book by anyone interested in the topics with which it deals. My own particular interest in the book was in the area of multipole expansions where I found Papas' presentation unequaled by any of the standard texts such as Jackson.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1277GI1IWKVNW"}}, {"Date": "on March 31, 2003", "Text": "In reading and lecturing from Theory of Electromagnetic Wave Propagation by C.H.
