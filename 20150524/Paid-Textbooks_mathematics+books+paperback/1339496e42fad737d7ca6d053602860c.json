It is very dense, and does not contain much in the way of explanation.  If you can learn applied math straight out of this textbook, then you are smarter than I am.  For me, I had to find a bunch of other resources to help me learn the material... a compilation of other less-terrible textbooks checked out from the library plus a bunch of internet resources.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3VKKIBX3LF7SC"}}, {"Date": "on March 8, 2011", "Text": "I did my Ph. d. on integral equation techniques, and I spent a lot of time in the math library looking for books on the subject that I could understand.

Toward the end he makes the connection between vector space and functional space and has a common language developed. The Linear Algebra is not of a very high level and should have been covered in a good undergraduate course. The Function Space concepts should be familiar to anyone having taking ODE using Fourier Transforms. I am know working in Chapter 2 and the concise way he writes leaves out steps or doesn't make explicit connections and so I find myself re-reading and looking for other resources. I have not tried the exercises but they look to run from straight forward to ridiculous, which is probably what a graduate text should do. So if he had used a few more words and steps I would give 5 stars but alas, I cannot.", "Helpfulness": 0.4, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A19N15QU7VHM0F"}}, {"Date": "on October 23, 1999", "Text": "The book doesn't have much examples.
