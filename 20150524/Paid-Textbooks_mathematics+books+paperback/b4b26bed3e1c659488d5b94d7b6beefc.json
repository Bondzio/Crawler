He starts by telling us about the age of the universe and its size while telling us a little about his personal journey in researching these things. Later chapters however take us into areas of physics which, by Tegmark's own admission, are much more speculative.  Tegmark suggests that our universe is really a multiverse and that this multiverse is really four levels of different multiverses.  The first level of multiverse is the physical universe we cannot currently observe.  The second level of multiverse is the physical universe we cannot currently observe and never will be able to observe due to cosmic inflation.  The third level of multiverse is the creation of parallel universes by the quantum wave function. In this multiverse observers break off into different worlds describable mathematically by an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.  The final multiverse is determined by all the mathematical structures that define the many different fundamental laws of physics that are theoretically possible. It is this final multiverse, postulated by Tegmark, that gives us the title of the book.  As the book progresses one starts to feel that Tegmark is no longer talking physics but metaphysics.  For example, Tegmark suggests that the mathematical multiverse is premised on the notion that this multiverse describes a reality independent of our minds.  Tegmark suggests that we discover rather then create this mathematical reality but how come the mind can use math to discover this reality?  Is the square root of 2 something that exists independent of the human mind?  If so, what does it really mean to say that the square root of 2 exists independent of the mind? Interestingly, another physicist, Saul Paul Sirag, when talking about a higher dimensional mathematical structure as the ontological structure underlying all reality, came to the conclusion that this mathematical structure was consciousness or mind itself.  Sadly, I think no lab experiment is going to settle these issues.  Tegmark's book helps one think about the bigger questions that physics may pose and is worth checking out.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2BFH14K06V3O1"}}, {"Date": "on March 20, 2015", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2UO765ATJJ7AO"}}, {"Date": "on October 21, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JM71CZLVDIJV"}}, {"Date": "on December 14, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1IU9VPCBKZPE8"}}, {"Date": "on July 1, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1RF584254TOIV"}}, {"Date": "on June 11, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7142857142857143, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3AC60530HL43E"}}, {"Date": "on September 22, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.75, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AL5RHOTVO7J50"}}, {"Date": "on March 27, 2015", "Text": "Too much discussion by the author about himself and not enough on the theories.

It's a book on cosmology, but in many ways it borders on metaphysical speculation -- and that is probably why it has stirred up so much controversy. Tegmark makes some very extravagant claims in the book, and perhaps the biggest of all is his statement that if he's wrong, then physics is doomed. By that he means that if the multiverse is not essentially mathematics, then physics can never hope to understand it fully, and will at some point encounter a dead point beyond which it cannot go. Without knowing more about Tegmark, one might question whether he is an opportunist or just someone who loves to rock the boat. I suspect the later, and that's probably why despite all the extravagant claims, I like him as a person; he is not afraid of making waves, even though it might cost him somewhat academically. The Level III multiverse is certainly the most controversial hypothesis in the book. And while it's extremely hard for the average individual to wrap his or her head around, it should not be ruled out solely for that reason. To simply state that it is way too far-fetched and absurd is not sufficient grounds for discounting it. The chapters dealing with the Level III multiverse are what make this book, in my opinion, so extraordinary and frankly unforgettable. The initial response is bound to be skepticism, but after some reflection perhaps an open mind is the best way of handling it. In refusing to dismiss it out of hand, one's whole view of life may change dramatically. That's the power of this book: you will come to view reality as a much grander, stupendous realm than you ever imagined. In the final pages of the book, Tegmark makes another extravagant claim: that our planet Earth is the only planet in our part of the Level I multiverse that has intelligent life. This, to my mind, seems almost harder to accept than Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation. Furthermore, insufficient arguments are presented to back up this contention. He also does not define what he considers intelligent life. It seems abundantly clear, based upon what we know about the lifeforms on our own planet, that there are various species that exhibit some forms of intelligence. Intelligence is not binary, all or nothing; there are gradations. This last claim, that our planet alone has intelligent life, has made me question the entire book more deeply and wonder whether there are underlying political motivations for arguing along these lines. Tegmark seems to be saying that our portion of the universe is ours for the taking, for us to exploit as we see fit. He says in so many words that mankind is the very crown of creation, and that it is our destiny to rule over our portion of the visible universe. I'm sure Ayn Rand would approve of such sentiments, but personally I find the book's ending a bit too jingoistic. We are not the center of the universe, metaphorically or otherwise, and we need some humility in respecting the vast multitude of lifeforms that make up this universe, intelligent and otherwise. All in all, however, this book is unforgettable, and one that will make waves for many years to come.", "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AXWX5NPVWR8KG"}}, {"Date": "on June 22, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A283M26442MULW"}}, {"Date": "on January 7, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2OY5TUB6O5WXE"}}, {"Date": "on December 30, 2013", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1U7LS93I03MFW"}}, {"Date": "on October 22, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "2", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A39MULB7OU501"}}, {"Date": "on August 18, 2014", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2AW5T67ZIU08O"}}, {"Date": "on March 4, 2015", "Text": "There is no question that Max Tegmark has some unique things to say about the nature of the \"universe.\" His tone is conversational and he is adept at making complex topics understandable.

The inner workings of cells, biochemistry, etc were not developed in Darwin's time, and as in so many texts, too much is assigned to Darwin's theory, and to Darwin himself . To attribute the nature of the universe to mathematical description is a phenomenon of the chauvinistic, arrogant, anthropomorphic human mindset. Whatever direction current technology is headed towards at a given time becomes the metaphor for the true nature of the universe. Currently, information in the form of quantum computing is regarded as the ultimate dynamic, and so the universe is a very large quantum computer. Prior to that it was viewed as energy.

It is unlike many popular science books written for the non-scientists in that while describing things that are already known (such as measures that can be made of the size and properties of the earth, sun and other stars) it shares the basis for the reader to intelligently examine many problems that are not yet definitively solved, including the ultimate nature of physical reality, and the nature of consciousness.  In the unsolved/exploratory areas of this journey Tegmark endorses and describes certain theories shared by many prominent scientists such as Cosmological Inflation, and others prominently his Mathematical Universe Hypothesis ones shared by a few leading researchers (such as Konrad Zuse, Edward Fredkin, Steven Wolfram giving his justification for each (as well as a means for refutation).  Interestingly, he also theorizes on the nature of a conscious entity (what he calls a Self-Aware Substructure [SAS]), explores the notion of whether we might be living in a simulation, and the likelihood and character of a Technological Singularity. I am slightly unclear (my limitations rather than the book) about what is the exact nature of the \"Mathematical Structure\" on which he claims physical reality is based, whether is is the same or differs from the Algebraic Structures referred to in modern Abstract Algebra.

Rather the Universe is a mathematical structure. I think it is a fairly convincing argument.

The twist is he grasps mathematics of these issues as both fundamental to our knowledge but also considers mathematics as 'the' reality of our world.
