Specific chapters on violin, piano, clavicord and harpsichord,  winds (brass and wood). Several references to guitar. The book is a little  old, which shows in the references, but is an excellent text for self  study. Most chapters have at the end a list of interesting experiments that  one can perform.

Benade, a musician himself, gives details about individual instruments, their playing quirks, and imperfections in intonation. If you like to tinker with instruments, this book is for you. There is an amazing amount of detail.

The author tries to explain all the details of the acoustics in lay terms without using any equations that a high school student wouldn't know.  The result: a book with too much repetitiveness, very little information density, and overall very boring.  One of the few books that I would consider sending back.

Turns out this is a heavy duty physics book on sound.  It is mostly theory and very little applied physics/engineering that would help me in building better sounding guitars or musical instruments.  If you are interesting in building better sounding guitars you are better off listening to or reading books and videos by William Cumpiano and Ervin Somogyi.  Just my opinion, I would save my money and get their books.

Having a BS in mechanical engineering, I am not a stranger to differential equations, but I don't particularly want to spend my leisure time solving them. This book is not for someone like me. This book is for someone who wants to read a novel about musical acoustics. Physical descriptions are not concise, but rife with draw out analogies. The ideas are miles apart. After having read a good deal of technical material I have come to expect a certain cold precision in descriptions of physical phenomena. This book doesn't deliver what I wanted.
