Olver presents a vast amount of material in full detail, and does it in an accessible way. Unfortunately the Kindle edition has many typos which are not present in the original book. In one proof (proposition 3.37), several lines are cut out of the middle (mid-sentence) and pasted back at the end of the proof. If you are familiar with this book and the subject matter then you can make sense of things. Otherwise, I would advise you to get a hard copy.", "Helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1KY4PSVYPS4Q5"}}, {"Date": "on November 3, 2006", "Text": "Not proper for first contact with the subject ,but as bibliographical resource, this is a realy good one.", "Helpfulness": 0.375, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2BF2B96Z2WG8M"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Applications-Differential-Equations-Graduate-Mathematics/product-reviews/0387950001/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.4 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$51.96", "Salesrank": "#170,420", "ListPrice": "$64.95"}
