The book begins with a quick review and quickly goes into methods and theory that are of interest to chemists i.e, many electron and molecular techniques. They also provide a nice collection of problems...with solutions! It is a very clearly written and well thought out book...highly recommended. For those who need a more elementary approach, check out \"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry\" by the same authors.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1YNZ9BT3YFS0"}}, {"Date": "on April 3, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A20MLMOAVAFVC"}}, {"Date": "on April 3, 2007", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1C4J9CUHT3UXE"}}, {"Date": "on September 5, 2012", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3STUU6SA6ECR2"}}, {"Date": "on May 1, 2011", "Text": "This book isn't for the first time QM experience. It skips right past all the basics and starts with two awful chapters on group theory that just seem out of place in the context of the rest of the book. I'm really not sure why they are there... After that, this book is golden. Its not overly thorough, but covers quite a bit of ground in the 300+ pages you get. I love the style, coming from a physical chemistry perspective. This book cant be beat for the price. I only wish it were longer. Not taking the group theory stuff into consideration, (you can just skip it... Its not used anywhere else in the book) this is definitely 5 stars for the price.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A103TB3PCM17Z"}}, {"Date": "on October 28, 2008", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A30EN7N3SP8AI0"}}, {"Date": "on November 26, 2012", "Text": "I enjoyed this book as a review of some quantum mechanics basics.
