                "Text": "This is a wonderful, nonmathematical introduction to special and general relativity. Gardner is a talented popularizer, and the two-color illustrations help make this an enjoyable book to read. My only misgiving is that the book is getting out of date on many topics. Ch. 1-6 are fine, but ch. 7, Tests of Relativity, is sorely in need of updating, and ch. 10-12, on cosmology, predate the recent revolution that has made cosmology a high-precision science and revealed that the universe is even stranger than we thought. I would like to see Gardner hand off this book to another writer who can produce a new, up to date edition."

                "Text": "This book was the best explanation of Relativity that I could find. I have had passed experience with a college course and two other books (Relativity: The Special and the General Theory and A Briefer History of Time). I found that this book gave good mental pictures for the reader to understand the theories. The book did not just come at the topic at one angle, it would tackle the subject from different sides. If and when I would think of a contradiction of one of the theories, the book would in the next section be explaining why that exact contradiction was not a contradiction. The book does not contain any of the math evolved in the theories, but I would say that it would be a good companion book to a more advanced college text book over Relativity. I would recommend this book for beginning Physicist or one who is interested in learning the theory of Relativity and/or its consequences."

I can't say I completely grasp everything relativity related, but my understanding of this concept has increased greatly as a result of reading this book (and Einstein's biography by Isaacson).  I feel better prepared to answer questions from my students regarding this subject.  I also think this would be an appropriate book to recommend to a high school student."

The book has direct and comprehensive explanations in term of questions that I though about and I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in this area but doesn't get its point yet."
