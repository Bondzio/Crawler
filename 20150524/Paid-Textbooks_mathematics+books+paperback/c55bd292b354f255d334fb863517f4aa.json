Just in the way that it covers the information that it does alone, in relation to a great nothingness and all of its counterparts, makes it a stimulating cosmic voyage.  But that voyage starts at home: planet Earth.  It starts out pretty philosophical discussing the abstraction known as zero.  It covers the cultural acceptance and interpretations throughout the scope of written history of zero, nothing, and void.  The Babylonians and Mayans, and last but not least Indians ( in their dynamic mystical lexicon frequently concerned with being and nothingness) were the only cultures to really designate the concept with a zero-like symbol.  The Greeks, commonly thought of as the masterminds at the source of modern logic and mathematical thinking, had no such symbol for a concept thought devoid of physical value.  The time capsule then picks up to the last several centuries (the times of the Scientific Revolution), and physicists earlier attempts to construct a physical vacuum against the vicious abhorrence of nature to such a monstrosity.  To call it a monstrosity is not much of an exaggeration but probably closer to a euphemism, for people like Augustine proclaimed the bizarre concept a satanic heresy.  Many many other related concepts are discussed that I will not delve into detail pertaining to, such as the Cartesian theory of the vortices and the life of the outdated theory of an all pervading and fluid Ether.  Then, slowly approaching the modern day it carries the reader into the domain of \"empty universes\",  and Einsteins familiar notions of spacetime and curvature.  Overall I found the Book of Nothing a pleasure of a read that intertwines science, philosophy, and math all into one great contemplation of nothing.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Z82XNTD381ZR"}}, {"Date": "on December 6, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8235294117647058, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A373ZCB1AYOZC"}}, {"Date": "on December 30, 2003", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8125, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP"}}, {"Date": "on September 5, 2001", "Text": "I was surprised, in a book about Vacuum, not to encounter any mention of its canonical forms (Casimir, Rindler, Inflationary, Cosmic String, and \"Groundhog Day\"...but I may be leaving one out), as were detailed in J.

One would think, with Nothing else to write about (pun intended), this book would go into greater depth on the subject of what is known about Vacuum and the distribution of energy density, for instance.

It combined history, philosophy, and science - all on the subject of nothing.  My only complaint is the author's contention that the Christian religion invented the fact that God created everything out of nothing.

The gimmick, of course, is that it is about \"nothing.\"  And it traces the history of nothing, explains a lot of different \"nothings\" and, suprisingly enough, for the most part it is very interesting.  The Author does an excellent job of making complex definitions clear - definitions that could be, and often are, put in such esoteric terms you'd think the people writing it simply don't want anyone else to understand them.  That said, the book gets more complex (perhaps too much so) about 2/3s of the way in . . .
