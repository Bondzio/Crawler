The book is very well written about a very technical subject.  It reveals possibilities that, I'm sure, NASA engineers are well aware of but are reluctant to discuss openly with the public in that there is such a public outcry by a very vocal minority opposing anything nuclear.  The only possible future for significant utilization of space as a resource is nuclear propulsion.  Imagine using high impulse nuclear rockets to create huge solar power satellites in space!  Nuclear propulsion is the only way it will ever happen.  I highly recommend it to give you an overview of what the future in space exploration could look like.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AW8SV7XKOWC4I"}}, {"Date": "on February 21, 2013", "Text": "The book is interesting and well worth reading for the story of this fascinating technology, although one might wish it had been written a little more elegantly.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AL4JSDZJNXHHM"}}, {"Date": "on February 3, 2015", "Text": "This is a terrific book for anyone who longs for the United States to return to leadership in rocket propulsion", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A186WA7PVI7TA6"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Nuclear-Rocket-Making-Peaceful-Prosperous/product-reviews/189495999X/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "4.8 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "$20.85", "Salesrank": "#1,330,703", "ListPrice": "$21.95"}
