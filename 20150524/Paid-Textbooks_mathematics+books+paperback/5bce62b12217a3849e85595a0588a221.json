The author explains many of the conceptual aspects very well. The material discussed in the book gives a very good perspective to anyone who is interested in applied numerical methods for differential equations. Different aspects of numerical methods are discussed much more deeply than any other numerical book. Although the book is mainly a spectral methods book, it can be valuable to anyone who wants to know numerical techniques more deeply.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HNPHAPEUTYR4"}}, {"Date": "on April 17, 2013", "Text": "I'm from a different field but wanted to use some of these techniques to perform calculations for my project.
