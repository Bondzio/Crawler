Brian Greene's clarity of thinking and joy of exploring the quest for the ultimate physics theory come clearly through as he describes how superstrings just might be the \"common  thread\" that runs through this universe from the tiniest quantum bits  to the largest relativistic bodies.  Are you curious to know how all these  dimensions can exist in our universe unseen?  Greene brilliantly describes  memorable analogies (such as an ant seen from a distance to be walking  along on a garden hose) that give readers a clear sense of what hidden  curled dimensions might feel like... and he writes about physics with such  grace and style!

The author is an active researcher and a popular writer in this field who is also known for his presentation on PBS's NOVA about quantum cosmology. Since the postulation of special theory of relativity, Einstein and subsequent physicists have struggled to explain the four natural forces of the most basic components of matter; the electromagnetic force; the strong and weak nuclear forces; and the gravitational force by one unified field theory (a.k.a., theory of everything: Superstring/M Theory). This theory must unify the forces of the cosmos, and forces of microcosm thereby explaining the creation of heaven and earth. The author covers significant amount of material in simple clearly written non-technical and non-mathematical form. The book is described in four parts; first two parts introduces theory of relativity and quantum mechanics and the unholy marriage of the two that results in the complexity of understanding the forces of the cosmos and subatomic forces. The latter two parts describes Superstring theory that evolves into more focused M theory to explain all physical forces of nature. This theory suffers from lack of experimental evidence, but rests solely on mathematical calculations.  Hence it was subjected to heavy criticism during early years of the theory by leading physicists. However it has emerged as a winner as the theory grew out of academic obscurity to leading contender in quantum cosmology. The book has interesting tales about the leaders of the field such as Ed Witten who is strongly favored as the true successor of Albert Einstein. The author's enthusiasm and excitement about his involvement in this field is evident abundantly, when he discovers that fabric of space tears and repairs itself. This book is lot more informative and enjoyable than Michio Kaku's Hyperspace (see my review of this book). At the end of the book, notes to each chapter, Glossary of scientific terms, and suggested books for further reading offers stepping stones to more enthusiastic readers for furthering their knowledge. The author has done an excellent job of writing this book, and I encourage you to buy it: But he could have considered writing a chapter on mathematical methodology and some basic approaches to calculations that probably would have made this book one of the top few in this field.", "Helpfulness": 0.96875, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS"}}, {"Date": "on November 24, 1999", "Text": "Ive been reading several books on RT/QM like \"Relativity Simply explained [Martin Gardner]\", \"Alice in Quantum Land\" etc. but this is so far the best i have read. the scenarios that Brian sets are  fantastic.

However, when explaining more recent aspects of the theory, which are more complex and speculative than the basic \"elegant\" foundation, the book loses clarity.  Perhaps it is because the findings are too new, and the scientists themselves still don't really understand the details well enough to explain them to others. Regardless, for understanding the nuances (albeit not the details) of the latest developments of string theory watch the Nova production by the same name, which is also narrated by the author, and which covers recent progress in the theory that is either not in the book at all or is not explained as well in the book.

This subject is extremely difficult mathematically -- it occupies the very highest talent level in physics -- and yet Dr. Greene does an extraordinary job of explaining the essential ideas in non-technical language for the intelligent lay person.  The book conveys the excitement about the recent discoveries, and recounts some of Greene's own original work, providing the reader a fascinating glimpse into the creative process.  The explanations of relativity and quantum mechanics are among the best non-technical explanations I have read.  The need for superstrings (or ultimately M-theory) is well motivated and the basic idea of the theory is well explained.  The theory's limitations are discussed forthrightly.

But, after reading the book, these two latter topics become not remote for me anymore.  My grasp of the essence of the book may be summarized as follows: There had been three conflicts.  The first conflict, briefly put, is due to Newton who advocated that if you run fast enough you can catch up with a departing beam of light, but Maxwell's laws of thermodynamics state that you can't.  Einstein resolved this conflict through his theory of special relativity; regardless of relative motion between the source of light and the observer, the speed of light is always the same, i.e. 670 miles per hour.  The second conflict immediately followed since Newton's law of gravity says that gravitation can reach any distance instantaneously; while Einstein's special relativity says nothing can outrun light. Einstein resolved this conflict through his theory of general relativity; gravitation keeps pace with but does not outrun light. The third conflict is between general relativity and quantum mechanics.  This conflict has been resolved by string theory.  On sub-Planck-scale distances, the quantum undulations are so violent that they destroy the notion of a smoothly curving geometric space; this means that general relativity breaks down.  String theory does respect all the requisite properties inherent in any sensible physical theory, and through its graviton pattern of vibration it is a quantum theory containing gravity.  In string theory, the string - unlike point particles in quantum mechanics - is large enough to be unaffected by the violent sub-Planck-length undulations.  Such is the universe described by string theory, in which we see that the laws of the large (Einstein's general relativity) and the small (quantum mechanics) can be harmoniously merged together. So far, top three successes of string theory may be listed as; in settling that the fabric of space can tear, in solving a central puzzle concerning Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes, and in rationally modifying the conclusions of cosmic origins.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1XHBYXM8ONJ5M"}}, {"Date": "on January 18, 2003", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A37DAAORNEU8GX"}}, {"Date": "on March 23, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3DCJ5Q657UK5K"}}, {"Date": "on July 6, 2000", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1LJ334ZTQ21Q0"}}, {"Date": "on May 3, 2006", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2J54650LNKWW"}}, {"Date": "on February 12, 1999", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.7727272727272727, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on May 26, 2002", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on May 23, 2003", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AN2WCDXNBRQC8"}}, {"Date": "on December 10, 2006", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1O797T42MWM19"}}, {"Date": "on May 13, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2212VJ7IG08NP"}}, {"Date": "on July 2, 2001", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": ""}}, {"Date": "on April 19, 2003", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 0.8181818181818182, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ"}}, {"Date": "on November 16, 2005", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HEWQWVYGYG59"}}, {"Date": "on January 29, 2006", "Text": "This is a book for general readers who don't have much technical background of cosmology but who still like to learn about it.

Enough play, this book is the layman's guide to the hardcore  regions of physics.  No more idle play with particle physics and atomic  physics. Forget nuclear physics and neutron physics.  Brian Greene attacks  with ferocity the underlying heart of matter:  elementary particle physics,  the most difficult branch of physics and all intellectual endeavors ever  undertaken by the human mind.  Greene first lays the groundwork for the  main focus of his book.  He elucidates relativity, then quantum mechanics,  and finally the incompatibility between these two pillars of modern  science.  Once these formalities are out of the way, Greene takes  superstring theory by the reigns.  He introduces the concept of the  vibrating string, how strings resolve the incompatibility between QM and  RT, the necessity for extra dimensions, the shape of these dimensions, the  predictions of superstring theory, experimental evidence for this theory,  further esoteric predictions of superstring theory, difficulties currently  residing within the theory, and future prospects, to name but a few of its  selling points.  Greene is a master of analogies which help him explain  many of the concepts in his book with relative ease.  His use of analogies  for well known concepts, such as blackbody radiation and the photoelectric  effect are novel and cute.  It is a relief to see care taken to think up of  new analogies than simply borrowing from the earlier pedigrees! Very well  done!  When all is said and done, this book might not be all that easy of a  read for some.  Having a thorough and extensive physics background and a  true, deep passion for physics, this book simply quenched my thirst.  Nothing was of any suprise.  However, for the newbie, it may be difficult  to digest three enourmous theories in only several hundred pages, and  furthermore, requires a fair amount of love of the subject to be truly  moved and appreciative of the content.

And guess what?, when we get down to the unfathomably small, their combined power predicts a world that just can NOT be! This is the ball that Prof. Greene drops squarely in our lap....or maybe on top of our head. We can't reject either theory, and yet we also can't deny that together they eventually lead to unavoidable conflict. Something is not right, which means we have to devise a theory that will alleviate this clash without rejecting either of these two fundamental precepts of modern physics. Prof. Greene plots a course and guides we nonprofessionals along a path arguing that the best chance for a solution to this fundamental fogginess rests with String Theory. He devotes the first half of the book to bringing us up to speed with respect to relativity and quantum theory, and then he shifts it into a higher gear by introducing us to String Theory, what it is, how it solves the root problem, and what its ramifications to us are if, indeed, it is correct. The text is written for lay people, but it is still quite a heady beast at times. Plenty of stuff here to grind your teeth over and push your brain dial toward critical mass.

For me it was more than a refresher course as I had forgotten exactly how  they worked and what evidence there was for making these theories  absolutely true.  I begin to enter a cave as Greene journeys into string  theory and super string theory.  The descriptions and examples become dim  and harder to conceptualize perhaps because the theory is still relatively  new.  Greene does not go into the \"math\" but having a math mind would  certainly make things easier to understand.  I did have glimpses of  understanding from one sentence to the next.  String theory is a  revolutionary way of looking at things and bringing the physics of  everything together hence its name The Theory of Everything (TOE).  Most  difficult for me was understanding the significance of Calabi-Yau shapes  and their relationship to string theory and hidden dimensions.  Rather like  the ultimate Chinese jigsaw puzzle.  The desire grew to \"play\" around with  these shapes on a computer in an attempt to get intimate with them and gain  some beginnings of understanding.  And the difficulty of string theory is  the framework of conceptualization.  Like being told you can breath  underwater, there is an inherit distrust and discomfort in letting yourself  go and breath in the water.  If I gained one kernel of understanding string  theory it would be that this theory brings together two huge theories in  physics that have great evidential support for their truth and existence,  but when taken together fail at nearly every level.  Why the disparity?  Can they both be right just not compatible?  The two great theories being  general relativity  and quantum mechanics.  Two theories that explain  opposite ends of the universal spectrum: for one, the very large or  cosmological, for the other, the very microscopic, so small the individual  \"elements\" can not be seen even with our most powerful magnifying tools.  String theory offers a new view of what these tiny constituent elements are  and how they work, and why they work in bringing the two existing theories  together.  I think in terms of bringing past theories down to earth,  compared with Hawking's A Brief History of Time, Greene brings the laymen a  notch higher in his understanding.  This, even with the very difficult and  ambiguous ideas of string theory.  I think Greene's book is more accessible  and more likely to be used as a quick point of reference material.  It's  difficult not to wonder how close to the mark string theory actually is to  the \"truth\".  I think we may not know for a hundred years although that  estimate may be pessimistic.  I don't give the sciences a fair estimate in  coming up with compelling solutions and the evidence to support them.  I  always think they are decades away.  However the speed of knowledge may  have momentum in its favor and solutions may present themselves quickly and  accurately.

I found it fairly easy to comprehend the subject matter up to a point.  I think that there were far to many subjects covered.  There was definitely enough material there for several books.  With that in mind, I will say that the author did an excellent job of condensing it but I found myself having to go back to earlier chapters for better comprehension. The complexity of the subject matter makes it next to impossible to describe certain aspects of this science adequately and in such a short book. I couldn't help but wonder if there is only a certain amount of comprehension that can be derived by describing these abstract concepts with words alone.  I would imagine that an understanding of the mathematics that gave rise to these theories would be the only way to 'see' these concepts 'truly'.  Never the less this book had me riveted almost to the very end at which point the descriptions became so convoluted and the writing so dramatic that I just gave up.  I would have given this book 5 stars for the attempt alone if I hadn't read 'The Dancing Wu Lei Masters' afterward. I read that book cover to cover several times.

Now it is as much a metaphysical matter as it is a physical one. The truth is there is no absolute truth. WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE. Only whatever is out there IS out there and we are far from knowing what IT is. Perhaps we'll never know. Perhaps we will. The universe is much larger than we can conceive and it's still expanding, an infinite roll of tape that continues to be rolled out. Suns, moons, stars, planets, solar systems, galaxies all continually perpetuated. Even a new planet has been discovered in our own solar system. When we look into space - to the stars, we are seeing dead stars' light, we are seeing what they were like in the past when they were still burning. Soon, even our own solar system and planet will join such 'after-light'. This is well-written, masterful and thoroughly scientific. It appeals to both string theorists and even metaphysic lovers.

Kaku's book while somewhat dated and not including the latest theories is more direct and provides much more information on how these theories were developed.  I found many of Green's examples needlessly cute, sometimes annoying and occasionally obfuscating.  Greene generously uses a metaphorical writing style to make difficult concepts understandable to laymen.  In the process he produces paradoxical illustrations.  For example, Greene's expositions of time dilation and Lorentz contraction (pp. 38-39 and 63-64) are problematic.  First, Greene proposes a photon bouncing between two mirrors on a moving platform and suggests that the stationary observer will observe the photon moving along a diagonal as it approaches the upper mirror.  But this contradicts what he asserts earlier:  Once launched, the photon should keep moving on its original path because it does not get a \"kick\" toward the direction the platform is moving.  It may even miss being reflected back by the top mirror if the platform is moving fast enough!  Second, he puts a guy named Slim on the perimeter of a kind of centrifuge and says Slim's ruler contracts and gives a measure greater than the actual circumference.  But if the tangential motion contracts the ruler it should also contract the perimeter of the so-called \"tornado\" centrifuge equally.  My greatest disappointment is that Greene states that string theory solves incompatibilities between quantum physics and the general theory of relativity although he never clarifies just how this is accomplished.  Even with his brilliant advocacy of string theory, Greene does not overcome the general impression that it is highly speculative and based on shaky mathematics and weak experimental foundations.", "Helpfulness": 0.38461538461538464, "StarRating": "3", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1WLMFMW6U1O8S"}}, {"Date": "on July 13, 2002", "Text": "I was a freshmen in highschool taking a high physics course.

Superstring theory is totally unproven and at this point seemingly unprovable. It adds nothing to what is already known, but it seems capable of embrassing and accepting anything new that is discovered in particle physics.

On the  positive side, it proved to be a good soporific, hence the one crown I gave  it as a mark. Seriously, to give Mr Green his dues, he does know the  subject, and there are kernels of interest, but the style is pedantic (not  to be confused with rigorous) to the point of absurdity (his treatment of  clocks is painful), without adding anything to the illumination of the  actual subject. I would have given you a typical quote, but it would take a  full page, and although I'm writing this to try and save you some money,  well, I'm not that dedicated. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends  or even to innocent strangers. You can skip the rest, as it contains a few  related but non relevant thoughts.
