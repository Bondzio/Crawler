The areas discussed are mainly within indian reservations and state parks where it is illegal to prospect in most of them.  As for the indian reservations, they probably don't allow it either.  Although these area have been picked clean over the decades, I found it interesting to load up Windows Live Local or Google Earth to view the many map areas displayed in the book.", "Helpfulness": 0.875, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A30PZ24XZWOZ5D"}}, {"Date": "on June 15, 2011", "Text": null, "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3Q58K6U6R7R4X"}}, {"Date": "on March 9, 2014", "Text": "In the Nevada Desert there is Gold here and you don't have to go far, the Book basically talks about California, and other states besides Northern Nevada, but in general its a basic guideline for DESERTS in General and in this State you don't have to go far to find it, a metal detector, a little bit of dry panning and a whole lot of patience, and Dab nabit you can get Lucky too, happy Huntin.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2UI933LI2Y48W"}}, {"Date": "on February 3, 2013", "Text": "Bought this when we were activly searching for the big nugget in CA.

Lots of interesting stories on buried treasure and lost mines. One critique of the book is that even though the book is about the desert, he omits any information about Death Valley. He believes that one should be an expert on the desert before looking for gold and treasure in that part of the country. Readers would have been better served with a warning if he felt it necessary and then information on Death Valley. Overall a good read and something I will be referring back to for a long time for weekend excursions into the desert.", "Helpfulness": 0.5, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3W19E9BS56IP8"}}, {"Date": "on January 4, 2015", "Text": "great book", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2P5GPBRERPEML"}}, {"Date": "on July 9, 2014", "Text": "Good Read", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2IEHUJ77PRHPE"}}, {"Date": "on September 1, 2014", "Text": "great", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A11BSJ08UN7D0P"}}, {"Date": "on July 8, 2014", "Text": "as advertised", "Helpfulness": 0.0, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AVM19FT8SY86K"}}, {"Date": "on April 13, 2013", "Text": "Like most books on this subject, this one is old and outdated and isn't really going to tell you where to find gold in the desert.
