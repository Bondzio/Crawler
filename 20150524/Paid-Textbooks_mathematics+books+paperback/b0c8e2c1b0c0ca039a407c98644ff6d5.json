It taught me ALL SORTS of secrets  about motion and principles behind gears and gear-driven mechanisms.

I was already familiar with most of the theories from Dynamics and Statics, but it was cool to see how non textbooks refer to certain things (IE rather than saying the pivot point they call it the fulcrum). While we generally go over gear theories and calculations in Dynamics, we certainly don't get into their classifications so that was another useful piece of knowledge that I picked up. The last two chapters were extremely knowledgeable, since neither was in any of my textbooks. The last two chapters covered power trains and the internal combustion engine and were surprisingly in depth. I would highly recommend this book for any Engineering student seeking to get an out of the textbook perspective on your Mechanics classes, or to pick up some information on the inner workings of the engine.", "Helpfulness": 0.975, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JUTK1FVD71OO"}}, {"Date": "on January 19, 2010", "Text": "Good, clear illustrations.
