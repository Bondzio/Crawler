So I bought it; it is easy to understand, lays out what you need to really establish a solar system, and shows you numerous potential layouts so that you can set up your own system. One of the things that is stressed is with Solar, the Homeowner needs to be involved in the design and installation process, and completely understands how the system works - because in the vast majority of instances, the homeowner is also going to end up being the repairman, especially when the home is in a remote area. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone who is interested in Solar Energy.", "Helpfulness": 1.0, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2D1B9FDM81WPH"}}], "ReviewUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/Solar-Electric-Independent-Home-Book/product-reviews/1879523019/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful", "AverageStarRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars"}, "OfferPrice": "", "Salesrank": "#879,358", "ListPrice": ""}
