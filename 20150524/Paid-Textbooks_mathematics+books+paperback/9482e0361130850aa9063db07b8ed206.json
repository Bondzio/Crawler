I only read certain chapters of Archimedes (each chapter on a different topic essentially) and greatly enjoyed reading -how he thought -or, as Heath notes, what he actually put down.  Some things, as noted, later mathematicians tried to figure out just how Archimedes came to such knowledge - often with great success - sometimes not - a great book for thinking about mathematics.", "Helpfulness": "", "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3TMPJFUCZ0DSQ"}}, {"Date": "on December 6, 2012", "Text": "A masterpiece of scholarship, on par with Heath's edition of Euclid's elements.
