The book has enough problem solutions to help get on the right track and lots of problems to try in each chapter. This Hardback edition covers 32 chapters, wow, lots of information and many chances to beat that stupid head of yours against the wall trying to understand the subject. Hint: better to try the problems than to read and hope to understand, because I learned more by \"doing.\""

The only reason I bought this book instead of borrowing a friends to use was so that I wouldn't have to purchase the wileyplus code for another $95 dollars.  I am very unsatisfied with this purchase and would advise you to buy your \"new\" book elsewhere."
