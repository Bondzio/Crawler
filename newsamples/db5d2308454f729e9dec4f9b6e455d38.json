                "Text": "Disappointing content.  The examples are quite old, but I expected that given the date of publication.  However the content itself is not very good.  The format of the book takes some mathematical concept  and tries to wrap it around a spaceflight idea.  However there is very little insight provided to the student.  The format is also overly verbose and hard to read. I'm a practicing aerospace engineer and teacher and I could come up with problems that are better worded and better illustrate both the mathematics and the spaceflight concepts."
