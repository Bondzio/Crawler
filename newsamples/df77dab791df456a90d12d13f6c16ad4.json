                "Text": "I recently bought the Kindle edition. The content offers clear explanations of many-body physics and the techniques involved, but the copyediting is horrible. It is quite a pain in reading the symbols and equations (e.g. \\psi and \\psi^dagger have different sizes because \\psi^dagger is an imbedded picture). If there is a separate rating for copyediting or formatting, i would have it as 1 star."
