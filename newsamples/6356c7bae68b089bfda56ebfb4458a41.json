                "Text": "This is a fantastic compilation of modern scientific history. I enjoyed the stories and the quotes from the scientists and the laymen (such as myself) trying to understand their work and theories. I love all science, especially the chemistry, geology and physics of the universe, but I must admit I was never big on relativity, QM or QFT. I just couldn't understand all the abstracts as I viewed them. I had to read this book in bits and pieces to grasp what Dr. Brooks was trying to convey. His writing style, the many enjoyable comparisons and the humor, mixed with the stories about the scientists kept me coming back. I now am ready to read this book again in a more constant manor. I never re-read a book, but I'm looking forward to this one. Thank you Mr. Brooks for writing this new understandable text on field theory physics for dummies like me."

I continue to recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand modern physics.  I know of no other book that presents the basics of physics, with numerous historical asides, as well as the concepts of quantum field theory (QFT) for a lay audience.  Also, the text shows how QFT resolves the paradoxes and difficulties the usual approaches are forced into because of their initial conditions. As co-author of a physics textbook myself, I also urge physics students to read this book.  They will be surprised and delighted at some of the revelations, such as the simple derivation and explanation of E = mc2."

                "Text": "The author of Fields has an exciting theory to work with.  Quantum Field Theory, the theory that all particles and forces are part of a larger, spread-out entity called a Quantum field network, each particle and force with its own separate (but connected) field.  This theory actually enfolds the standard model of quantum mechanics plus Einstein's theory of gravity into one unified theory.  The author identifies six fields which are the substance and fiber of space, thus there is no such thing as empty space.  Gravity itself is a field.  This makes tremendous sense when one considers that we know with total assuredness that all electromagnetic phenomena are in fact aspects of an electromagnetic field, and have been identified as such for many years. In order to make his thesis of space encompassing fields the author uses various colors to help the reader stick with the notion of the various fields. The colors are symbolic.  Thankfully, for those of us not math whizzes the author stays away from math and complex quantum/relativistic jargon language to flesh out his narrative.  Superb concept, well done.

I even kept it at my nightstand before falling asleep! Highly recommended, esp. for those interested in science but without a physics background."

Introductory texts on QFT are almost impenetrable even knowing the math required for a grad level QM class.  This book allows one to get the main ideas in QFT before taking the plunge into the harder math.  For the layperson this book is a great way to appreciate how the universe works that makes good sense."

                "Text": "This wonderful book opened my eyes to an entirely new theory. The book introduced me to Quantum Field Theory. The name itself is intimidating, but the way the author explained the theory was very clear. The theory is that the universe is made of fields. To make things clearer, the author assigned a color to each field. Thus the title. There are six different fields: gravity, electromagnetic forces, the strong force, the weak force, matter (matter is composed of two fields). The book also shows how the strong and baryon fields are made of more basic fields called quarks and gluons, and how this theory led to \"one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time. This theory is different from Quantum Mechanics in many ways. For starters, this theory is elegant and straightforward. It puts Quantum Mechanics to shame in terms of simplicity. I definitely recommend it to anybody who is interested in reading about physics."

                "Text": "You will learn from this book that elementary particles like electrons and quarks can be regarded as locally induced vibrations of of fields.  A field is some sort of object that exists throughout space.  From that point of view, many the paradoxes that you read about that permeate quantum mechanics, like double slit experiments, can be explained.  That is, the answer to the perennial question \"Is it a particle or wave?\" is wave!  Because of the absence of the underlying mathematics you won't learn to much more than that from reading the book.  However once you have that under your belt you might have the courage to dip into books with \"Quantum Field Theory\" in the title and thus get really educated.,"

Einstein searched in his remaining years for a single equation to do this hat trick without success.  This general solution involves, as I read it, a separate and distinct field or wave equation for each of the forces."
