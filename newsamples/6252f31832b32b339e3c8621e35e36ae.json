                "Text": "This theory was developed to explain the James A. Patterson Fuel Cell (US Patent 5494559).  Here is a summary: The superconductor nanosphere, the pinned electric field, the collapsing matter wave, and the nuclear cluster speed itself were matched at 1 million meters per second create a channel of matching impedance whose resonant vibration shakes the grip of elastic discontinuity.  Different velocities between the electron and its pinned electrical field creates an elastic bubble (discontinuity) which interacts and matches the speed of the mechanical waves within the nucleus to produce cold fusion."
