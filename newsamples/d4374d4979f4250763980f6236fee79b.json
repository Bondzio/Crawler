                "Text": "This book is one of the early written books dealing with silicon device physics. I use it every day in my research work since it provides a comprehensive theory of the semiconductor devices. It also provides a good  explanation of the physical mechanisms involved in these devices. Everybody  working in the electronics field, from device engineers to circuit  designers, should have this book in his library."
