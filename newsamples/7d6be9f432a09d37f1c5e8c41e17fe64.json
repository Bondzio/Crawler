                "Text": "A collection of lectures by professors attending a conference in Ustica Italy in 2000, this book covers a broad range of subjects including many that are often overlooked.  We use this as a supplement to our textbook (Libes) in Marine Biogeochemistry/Chemical Oceanography.  The chapters on aerosols, photochemical processes and a collection of chapters on toxicants (endrocrine-disrupting, organic and organometallic compounds) round out holes in the Libes book.  Additionally, the other chapters present an up-to-date view of marine chemistry and organic matter cycling.  This is not a true replacement for a more traditional textbook, but it is a great readings supplement."
