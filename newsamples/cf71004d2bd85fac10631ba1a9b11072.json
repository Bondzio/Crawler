                "Text": "The Winter Sea is wonderful. It is exactly the kind of historical fiction that I love reading. The story is about a writer in the present time who travels to Scotland and stays at a cottage in Cruden Bay (between Aberdeen and Edinburgh) near Slain Castle to research materials for her novel about the Jacobite uprising of 1708. (King James (Catholic) was exiled from the English throne to France when Mary and William became King and Queen (Mary was James' daughter) at the request of the English people. King James died in France in 1700, but his son James (aka The Pretender) with the help of the French King invaded Scotland to try to reclaim the crown.) This was the period of the first Jacobite uprising, historical materials for which are hard to come by, as there were many cover-ups, betrayals, etc. Ms. Kearsley gets better with each book she writes. I was reminded pleasantly of Lady Dorothy Dunnett's writing style in which fictional characters are interwoven with real people and events. This book was so much like Lady Dunnett's Checkmate, her six book of the Lymond Chronicles, except that Kearsley is so much easier to read. I loved this book."

                "Text": "At my age, I'll just say over six decades, I have read a few books in my time.  Some of my favorite books being, West With the Night, by Beryl Markham; Sena Jeter Nashlund's, Ahab's Wife, One Thousand White Women by Jim Fergus, Outlander by Diana Gabaldon; The Red Tent, Cutting for Stone, The Help, Sarah's Key I could keep going but you can tell the kind of books I like from that sampling.  Well I have never been so emotionally involved in a book like I was with Winter Sea.  I can hardly find words to tell what a fantastic read this was.  All I can say, and I do love to write myself, is that I wish I could tell a story the way Susanna Kearsley does!"

Hard to put down and the ending was absolutely perfect. Nice to read a book that is romantic, captivating, and intersting without needing the use of sex, violence, or foul language. Highly recommend!"

I enjoy description. I enjoy poetic description. I do not enjoy overly lengthy, simply there for the word count description. So much so that I skimmed...*I skimmed!*...through quite a few parts to get back to the semblance of plot. I have read several of Ms. Kearsley's books and thoroughly enjoyed them, with few exceptions. I cannot in good conscience say that I enjoyed this one. While historical fiction is my genre, this was a poor version of literature disguised mostly as a grade school teacher's rawhide lecture on Scottish History for Dummies. The way the main characters removed themselves from the story to dryly rehash the backstory leaves little to be desired. And while I'm not here for the romance, the love story not only wasn't believable but not romantic at all. I felt no connection or desire to see them together nor anxiety for them to reunite. My conclusion? Blah. Sadly, I finished out of compulsion not out of obsession, like you would any good book."

Susanna Kearnsley made this story so exciting to me.  It was a joy to learn about the Jacobites and how they fought so courageously to try to bring back their beloved King to the throne.  The historical facts were told through the eyes of the characters, which were real and believable and nicely developed.  I liked how the author would alternate between the present day--when the story was told by a young American writer Carrie who moves to Scotland to write a historical fiction book--and the past when it is told from the eyes of Carrie's ancestor, Sophia, who is living in northeast Scotland in a castle in the early 1700s.  Their is a beautiful love story in both settings.  I fell in love with the writing style of Susanna kearnsley and her characters.  Beautifully written book.  I want to read more of her books--i hope she has more.  I am hooked on her writing style."

It's the story of novelist Carrie McClelland, who is successful and famous for her historical fiction. She wants to write her next novel on the Jacobites, but can't seem to make the words flow. But one day, as she's driving up the coast, she sees the ruins of Slains castle, and is inspired. She settles in a cottage nearby and begins writing, playing with characters from her own ancestry, believing that she is taking liberties with history. But throughout the writing process, she begins to have strange memories, and when she writes down things she never read about, but later prove to have actually happened, Carrie is disturbed. Could such a thing as genetic memory exist, and what does that mean for her ancestors? I found this book to be very intriguing, entertaining, and so easy to become lost in."

I also bought this for my step-mother and she also had a difficult time finishing it. I guess I was expecting too much from this 'novel'.

I haven't been wanting to read books that take actual concentration to read.  However, once I was able to focus and got sucked in, well, I LOVED it!  I have not had a book move me as much as this one did in years!!!  Ach, not at all what I expected!  This is the first book I have read of Susanna's and I'm hooked.  I got so wrapped up into the characters, I truly started to care for them.  The historic detail made me want to travel to Scotland, now!!!  This book is defiantly worth the investment of time.  What I mean as time, it's not a skim through book to pass time.  It's a book where the characters come to life.  It takes you to another place, another time.  I haven't felt this much passion for a book in years!  This book rekindled the historian and hopeless romantic in me that has been dormant for a long time.  I absolutely fell in love with it!"

This is my first Susana Kearsley novel, but I read summaries and reviews of her other books, and this seemed like a good choice.  Unfortunately, I was never engaged. I read at least 25% of the book before giving up.  The story and the characters seemed to get more boring.  I decided to go back to the reviews and filter 1 and 2 star rating to see why these readers did not enjoy the book.  I totally agreed with their reviews.  I decided not to finish the book even though the plot sounded slightly more interesting than what I had already read.  There is no conflict or zing.  I did not like either main heroine nor did I think there was any chemistry between any characters.  There are too many 4 and 5 star books I'll never get to so I did not feel like plodding through this one, and I'm pretty sure I won't regret regaining my reading time to read better books."

If it is to be a character study, it needs fascinating three dimensional characters.  Sadly, it missed the boat on all three, when I think it could have been all three.  The characters had little chemistry, and were flat, the history was stretched, and the plot was lackadaisical.  I was disappointed and kept reading because I expected it to get better.  The writer has a lovely writing style and I just kept hoping that it would warm up, move more smartly or *something*.  Then these new characters kept popping up with little introduction and behaved predictably and in ways that served the plot. Darn.  Here are my recommendations for substitutes:  If you are looking for some mystery and intrigue, try \"The Woman in White\" by Wilkie Collins.  If you want romance; \"North and South\" by Elizabeth Gaskell (very swoon-worthy), and if you want history, try anything by Alison Weir.  Seriously, she'll take you into history and keep you there."

I was wrapped up from the first chapter and obviously having a hard time letting go now that it's ending.  This was a romance, historical, time travel book, all wrapped in one, that wasn't either raunchy in it's romance or left you wanting more.  The romance was very tastefully done.  And trust me, I like my raunchy romance, but I can also appreciate when the writer doesn't make the book about heavy amounts of sex. Overall, I cannot recommend this book enough to those who love those type of genres."

Ms. Kearsley has written an intelligent, touching story filled with historical facts and enduring love. I felt as if I were there, on the scene, an eyewitness to history while at the same time watching a love story develop both in the past and in the present.  What a perfect blend of fact and fiction.  A beautiful story of love and loss and hope that touched a range of emotions in me and had me, at times, reaching for a tissue. I know I will be thinking about this book and the wonderful people within its pages for a long time to come.  If you love history, if you love strong characters with strong beliefs about country and family you will, I promise, love this story. Bravo and thank you, Susanna, for this gem of a page turner."

I read a plot summary that said, \"the modern day heroine channels the memories from the past. That summary seems to suggest a paranormal plot line and that was not how I interpreted the book at all. It really is a story of how a love can be so strong and true to literally transcend time. Definitely worth reading!!!!!"

As with most historical fiction, many characters that touched their lives were actual, soldiers of that era.  In \"The Winter Sea,\" the story is about a (fictional) modern day writer of historical fiction, who seems to have a special gift for imagining the scenes of her story, only to find out through her research, that the stories turned out to be true, including names, dates and places.  Part love story, it is set in Scotland as they were trying to return the exiled King James to his rightful Scottish throne."

Maybe it was the way the story was written or maybe it was just a really good book but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the banter between Carrie and the rest of the current time characters and I loved the historical story about Sofia and John. I LOVED how their story ended and very few books could make me shed the tears I did.  I feel like I got a two for one reading this book.  The flow was great, the stories wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who likes an easy read."

It has time travel and a timeless romance; it has history, but it is fiction.  The love story is grand and passionate without being graphic and prurient.  Yup!  I liked \"The Winter Sea\" and recommend it highly."

This is the first Susanna Kearsley book I've ever read, but it won't be my last."

Kearsley's research and historical detail are gratifying but her characters are one-dimensional.  Particularly her 2 heroines.  They are flat and insipid and there's simply nothing about them to like.  It is therefore very hard to care what happens to them.  I give the book three stars for the interesting historical detail. Kearsley could be a fine writer but I was vastly disappointed with the plot and characters."

The way that Susanna makes the book flow, and how she descibes each scene actually makes you feel like you are seeing it for yourself. The transition between Carolyn's \"world\" and Sophia's was as smooth as silk. It didn't leave me feeling like I was missing anything. This book had me giggling, crying(which I hardly ever do), and actually throwing my hands up and shouting \"Yes!\" I will be re-reading this book over and over again for years to come I am sure. For anyone who loves history with a wee bit of fiction and romance thrown in. Will love this book. Great job Susanna!"

                "Text": "\"Let it be, we'll have warmth enough.\" (Favourite quote.) Oh if you need a romantic blockbuster of a story, this has to be up there with the best. This is my all time best loved novel, almost ever, one which I read time and time again. Set on the stark east coast of Scotland,( close to where I live) lies Slains Castle; a ruinous pile with so much history endless books have been written about it. Carrie McClelland arrives in Cruden Bay to write a novel, a little unsure of how the historical will reveal itself to her but before she has chance to catch her breath, it seems the novel is almost writing itself, as if told by a distant relative from Carrie's past. In the Seventeen hundreds Slains Castle is the epicentre of devious deeds as a group of dedicated followers of King James attempt to smuggle him back from his exile in France to reinstate him on his throne, his rightful place as the King of Scotland. It's 1708, now recorded in history as the doomed attempt of 08. At that time, Sophia finds herself living at Slains in the care of the wonderful Countess after a lifetime of abuse at the hands of her evil Uncle. Among the gathered secret visitors is the dark and brooding John Moray, a spy for the King, an ardent Jacobite follower and dedicated to his cause. What happens in their lifetime resonates forward through the centuries, finding a story of an amazing love within the pages of Carrie's unwritten novel. As Carrie comes to love Cruden Bay she begins to empathise with Sophia's desperate words as she prepared to leave Slains Castle all those centuries ago..\"My heart will be forever held in this place\"  Oh this story (not wanting to give too much away and spoil it for you) sweeps you away to troubled shores, violent weather, secrets and spies and devious doings from the doomed 08, all told through the words of a girl in love from the turrets of Slains with a back drop of an ever changing winter sea. Its heart breaking, thrilling and the best romance I have ever read since P&P; from Ms Austin. You are captivated as you read this and I promise you a conclusion to end them all, even the hardest of hearts, it's simply breathtaking, Deserving of a whole galaxy of stars!!"

                "Text": "Carrie has come to Scotland as part of her research for a new book, a historical fiction covering the attempted return of James to Scotland in 1708. She is enchanted by a ruined castle on her way to her agent's christening, and is shocked to later find that it is integral to her story. She finds herself taking a different perspective on the story and takes some liberties by telling the story through the eyes of a young woman, who she names Sophia. Deciding to stay in Scotland, she rents a cottage, meeting one son of the owner, a widower, on the plane ride over. He is brash and charming, and is intent on winning her over. Carrie becomes deeply involved in her book, writing in an almost trance-like state. She is surprised and disturbed to find that some of the things she thought she made up turn out to be historical fact.  Carrie contacts her father, who has a passion for the family's ancestry, and finds that her fictional Sophia may in fact be a real person that she is descended from. Carrie meets a local history buff who helps her with some materials, and is also surprised to meet the other son, a history professor, whose quiet charms begin to win her over. The story goes back and forth between the historical story and the contemporary one, with each having a compelling story. Is Carrie channeling the past of her ancestor through some form of genetic memory? It is an interesting blend of history, drama, light romance, and a touch of the fantastical."

I have spent a lot of time delving into the history of the Jacobites and thought that this book was about one of those attempts to put a Stuart on the throne.  Alas, it was a romantic story within a romantic story.  The story is simple, not interesting, and I finally forced myself to get through the book because I paid for it, otherwise I would have stopped.  The characters have absolutely no build-up.  I couldn't tell one from the other.  They all lacked personalities.  Aside from one character, who spoke Doric, the other Scots spoke like they had been born in London or New York.  As it was explained in the book, the author within the author, \"said that her readers wouldn't like it if she wrote their speech as if they were Scots.\"  That didn't stop Ms. Gabaldon.  This book and this author has been compared to DuMaurier, Seton, Gabaldon.  Shows you what a good publicist can do for an author.  No comparison.  The book was boring, uninteresting, no Jacobite history but for one page in which the romantic lead,who's an historian, explains where the word \"Jacobite\" comes from and the family tree.  Really, I don't want to continue on except to say that I hope Ms. Kearsley's other books are better but I will not spend good money to find out."

Ms. Kearsley failed to describe the two heroines at all, I had no mental picture of them. I also failed to understand why one, let alone more than one, suitors would fall for each of them after a few brief encounters. Their personalities seemed so run of the mill, they were perfectly fine, but not especially interesting. And there was zero passion between the lovers, and the love scenes, such as they were, were the opposite of sexy. They were sex-less. One plot device annoyed me...if you're living in a huge castle with a creepy pervert gardener who has threatened you, why would you use the same garden for secret rendezvous with your lover? Isn't that what stables are for? Or a dark corner closet? All in all, an okay read. It kept me interested, but I will not be reading more of this author's works. 3.5 stars."

That being said, I truly did like The Winter Sea, but it didn't grab and captivate me the way that I wanted it to. Susanna Kearsley's writing style is quite beautiful and her research of the time frame was obviously tremendous. I loved the characters of Sophia and Mr. Moray. Their romance was thrilling and the historical backdrop was exciting. I felt like I was transported to Slains, something that I feel is a hallmark of an excellent historical fiction piece. What brought the novel down a few notches for me was the back and forth pacing between the past and the present. I feel like the constant jumping around interrupted the flow of the book. I also did not particularly connect to Carrie, the writer who is channeling Sophia's voice. While Sophia is vulnerable and vibrant, I felt like Carrie was more of one note. Her romance was nice, but not electrifying like that of her ancestor's. Regardless, I am happy that I read this novel. It was fun and I learned quite a bit. Kearsley is a talented writer."

I was also impressed with the meta-fiction element: an author writing a novel about the author's ancestor; two interwoven tales that stay remarkably grounded despite the fantastical element.  Kearsley moves between the two main characters (Carrie and her ancestor Sophia) with ease, linking together small details and creating a memorable and moving story.  I found the plot somewhat predictable (not just the historical aspect, the literary one as well) and the reading easy going.  However, the simplistic use of language (with the exception of the Doric) and plot did not \"dumb down\" the telling.  I thought it merely showcased the characters themselves, drawing you in and leaving you touched my their stories.  I also enjoyed learning historical details of the Jacobite \"invasion\".  A good way to spend some leisure time and a good book to add to my personal library.  And made me desperately wish I could finally see Scotland for myself (the land of my ancestors) instead of always just reading about it."

However, I have tried to read this book several times and have gotten so bored by it that I will probably give up.  The writing is just so flat and doesn't draw you in.  I really don't like giving up on books because I kind of consider it to be a personal failure if I do, and there are definitely examples of extraordinary books that just start out slow (take Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for example).  But usually if I've gotten a good fourth or third of the way through the book and something hasn't changed to draw me in, I will consider it to be a lemon after all, which I think this book is unfortunately."

First thing to note is that it's not technically a time travel book (this is not a spoiler). The time travel consists of the character traveling in her thoughts to write a book but the connection is stronger than you might think. Secondly the history is a bit more complicated to follow in this one than The Rose Garden. It wasn't difficult to follow in The Rose Garden. Then again The Rose Garden took me about seven chapters before I was hooked. I'm only on page 90 currently so I have faith in the author. Continuing reading... it's page 133 where it takes the turn for me. Now that I'm done...What an emotional and fantastically written novel! It's not going to be for everyone - I love history so this did not dissuade me - it was like getting two books for the price of one!! Carrie as the author, and Sophia as the historical character - what a well written connection between the two. The brothers were endearing, and I was very fond of the ending!"

The heroine is about as engaging as a dishtowel, and for the life of me I could not figure out what the plot was. Then it dawned on me...there wasn't one. This book had all the makings of something I SHOULD have enjoyed reading, but I'm afraid it fell short. It just is so slow. I totally understand that the author has to build up a world, but my gosh the Egyptians built the pyramids faster than this author got to the point. Oh, also, the characters spoke with a Scottish accent and the author wrote it that way, and it made me want to gag. I can't explain way--it was just annoying. I have nothing against Scottish accents being written in books (you are looking at a huge Jamie Fraser fan), but this one was just not done well. So...yeah...maybe try reading something else."

Also, I read the \"surprise twist ending\" coming from the very first moment the 18th century characters met (that said, there was a twist about 2/3 of the way through that left me wondering if I was right. I was. And I really didn't like Carrie, the novelist protagonist; how's that for utterly subjective? All of this grumbling aside, however, I have to confess that the last 40 or so pages of the book did have me on the edge of my seat and almost rethinking my initial eyeroll reaction. In sum: I had to push myself to read the first several hundred overwrought pages, but the ending was worth it. And there are a few side characters who I really liked and would have liked to see more of. Do I recommend it? Worth picking up as a beach read, I think."

As always Susanna Kearsley's vivid descriptions and wonderfully developed characters allow the reader to be in the book alongside her amazing characters.  The dialogue throughout the book was brilliantly written - allowing the reader to be submerged into the story.  This book made me laugh and cry.  I loved all the characters.  Sophia and Moray were my favorite.  The connection between Graham and Carrie wasn't developed as well and felt rushed.  The storyline was fabulous.  Kearsley always does a seamless job intertwining the present with the past.  I was sad to say good-bye to the characters of this book.  Again, really disappointed I read The Firebird first!!!  Please make note to readers if books are in a series even if they could be read alone!!!"

                "Text": "The book has an intriguing premise: can a fiction writer really see and feel an ancestor's experiences through genetic memory by being in the same places she experienced them?  Carrie comes to Scotland doing research for her book on the 1708 Jacobite rebellion and starts to know Sophia's story and write it all down.  She knows she's researched some of the basics, but she knows details about lives and it's uncanny how the details keep being proved correct.  It's a great book that alternates between Carrie's story and Sophia's story in 1708.  It's a romantic story as both are drawn to unlikely loves.  It's also a tale of intrigue and suspense as the events of the rebellion unfold and Scots nobles try to return King James to the throne.  It's well-researched historical fiction told in an engaging and often mesmerizing way and the characters are worth reading about and caring for, in both centuries.  I liked this one better than \"The Rose Garden\" by the same author and I thought that one was great."

Tho' I knew she was supposedly writing about the past I believed it.  And I loved the present.  I loved the descriptions and the idea of genetic memory.  What fun!  But about 3/4 of the way thru, it began to be repetitive.  It dragged.  The past got too detailed about battles and genealogy.  And, in short, I did not believe the ending.  The present was too pat, and the past was unsatisfactory.  But if I'd stopped reading it about 100 pages before it ended I found it so mesmerizing and fascinating and beautifully written that I'd have given it 5*, but it bogged down. It got like Scotland - grey and monochromatic.  Also, tho the history was great, it eventually lost me, and it ended up being one dimensional in that it was just a Romance.  An unflagging one dimensional romance."

The comparisons to Diana Gabaldon's \"Outlander\" put me off because I love that series so much and didn't want to read a weak plotted ghost.  Not so!  The plot was so tight and tied up at the end to the last tiny knot.  Two stories in one and instead of being aggravated when the segments switched, I couldn't wait because both storylines were breathtaking.  The characters will live on in my mind.  Geez, even the dogs will live on in my mind.  I was with Jane all the way at the end and I was glad that Carrie listened to her.  I cried, I clenched, I yelled out loud.  I cheered Uncle Patrick and I wanted to shove Stuie down a flight of steps.  It wasn't \"Outlander\" but it was very, very, very good.  Books of this quality are few and far between.  I even sat on the internet and looked at Cruden Bay and the ruins at Slains.  Few books entice me to that extent.  Read it...don't miss it...you'll love it."

The Winter Sea has everything I like in a book, only this is even better because it's two stories wrapped up into one, with not one, but two heartswooning romances, and two happy endings! I've read other novels that flip back and forth between historical and present-day storylines, and in all of those instances I slogged through the present-day chapters longing to get back to the history. But in this case I enjoyed the present day story just as much as the past. I loved how the author wove the past and the present together as Carrie dreamed of the Jacobite invasion, finding inspiration for her novel, and then in her research discovered that her dreams were more than just dreams. I found that I really enjoyed reading about a fiction writer, and of course, I love anything set in Scotland! And it made me cry. I didn't want it to end. Very well done Ms. Kearsley! I've added all of her other books to my wishlist."

It starts off a little slowly, and if you're not up on the era you might need to keep a British monarchy family tree (1603-1710 James I-George I) handy to follow the politics. But once the author's traditional unexplained happenings begin it really takes off. Carrie, an historical fiction author, begins a book set at Scotland's Slaines Castle in 1707. She soon discovers, when she stops to do some research, that what she is writing is actually what happened -- right down to the historical characters names, movements, motives and vessel names! The love story for the author is not hard to figure out, the one in the novel she's writing is lovely, then tragic and heartbreaking. In true Kearsley fashion, there is a stunning plot twist at the end that I didn't see coming. This was also published with the title Sofia's Secret."

Among other authors, I have read several of Philippa Gregory's books and was pretty much captivated by them.  I read the reviews for The Winter Sea, and was expecting a great read.  Unfortunately I was so bored, I had to force myself to finish the book and I'm not glad I did.  I feel like I wasted my time. The writing is fine, but I kept waiting for something to happen and it never does. I am also a fan of Anita Shreve; her books just flow along and I actually have liked all that I have read, so it's not the style that bothered me. I mean you have an old castle, Scotland, the sea... how could I be so bored?  When I'm listening to a book and my mind is wondering to chores and work, I know I'm not interested. If you're looking for a book you can't put down, you might want to look elsewhere."

                "Text": "Miss Kearsley uses an interesting literary device to tell a dual story of romance, one in modern day Scotland and the other in Scotland 200 years ago,  Carrie Maclelland visits her agent in Scotland and falls in love with and in Scotland.  Historical facts that she should not have known came bubbling up as she stayed in a cottage next to a castle named Slains by the sea.  Carrie is a writer of historical fiction but her book quickly became more than fiction.  The story is about a girl named Sophie who met a Jacobite soldier at Slains.  Her view of the Jacobite rebellion for King James of Scotland and his ill-fated attempt to restore his monarchy gave a sense of the passion of those who opposed the joining of Scotland and Engkand..  In the meantime, while writing the book, Carrie was getting in a romance with a one of two brothers, both of whom were courting her."

I also grew to care very deeply for the characters.  It's definitely not your typical shallow romance where the sex is completely described for you, with those scenes being the main focus.  On the contrary, \"A Winter Sea,\"is built around the characters and their story, and those scenes are maybe not so plentiful, but when they are told, are emotional and beautifully romantic.  The historical aspect of the book is descriptive and very interesting and seemed well researched. Among my favorite books are \"The Bronze Horseman\" and the \"Outlander Series,\" and I would rank this book up with those. It's such a lovely emotional story. Tears were shed. I loved it!!"

I found this book to be more interesting when it was set in the present. I skimmed several sections set at Slains in the 1700's. Sophia and the Countess were well developed as characters, but John Moray never really became more than a stock romantic handsome man. The author didn't give him enough personality and the build up of their romance was rather brief. Moray's uncle, Colonel Graeme, was given more personality and substance. The lead character Carrie exploring how she knew Sophia's history and researching genetic memory was the best part of the novel for me, and Carrie's relationship with Graham in the present. I don't think I'll be reading any more books by Susanna Kearsley. Back to mysteries for me!"

Well-researched, well-written and rather poignant, I would recommend it heartily to anyone who might be interested in the time period or subject matter. I enjoyed the way Kearsley wove strands of the past and present into a believable and beautiful tapestry. It wasn't as sweeping as I normally prefer, but Kearsley has a knack for evoking much feeling with an economy of words. Without robbing her of any due credit for producing a very fine historical novel, I will say that her story stepped into the void left by Gabaldon's #8 book in the Outlander series and cured me of my cliffhanger blues."

I have never been to Scotland but I felt as though I was right there in the book. The novel is a mix of historical fiction and romance. I loved how the novel went back and forth between the protagonist Carrie in present day writing her book, and her novel itself. The parallels between Carrie's novel and the history she unearths during her research are startlingly alike. It's a fantastic page-turner and I look forward to reading more of Susanna Kearsley's novels. This is only the second of her novels I have read but I will definitely be reading them all.

While this one is good, I don't love the ending...and, I think, neither did Kearsley, because she wrote a sequel, \"The Firebird,\" which was quite compelling. It used a character from Shadowy Horses as well as continued the story of the Winter Sea. Each story can stand alone, of course. I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and thought she did a great job with the history of \"King Jamie, the black haired king over the water.\" I definitely recommend it as an interesting, relatively \"clean\" love story (the sexual content is more implied in most parts)."

Many \"historical\" romances turn me off when the chracters sound like they are from the current time. This was beatifully written and the period nicely captured. The concept this book introduced of genetic time-travelling was unique. An author I thought of while reading this is Diana Gabaldon. If you like the Outlander series, I think you would like this book also. This was my first Susanna Kearsley book and I look forward to reading another story by her based on this novel."

Since I read it I have reccomended it to many friends including other avid readers like myself.  Everyone that has read it loves it! The way Ms. Kearsley twists and winds the past and present together is flawless. Very interesting historical information and so other-worldly. The relationships that form and are \"remembered\" are amazing and heartbreaking. Until the very end of the book you truly don't know what the ending will be. A wonderful work of literature. So much fun to be carried away to a castle by the sea!"

Since I'm a fan of Diana Gabalon's Outlanders series, the similar premise of bridging between modern and 18th century Scotland attracted me. While I love Outlander, I think the Winter Sea is actually better. The characters are more sophisticated and realistic, and the flow felt very natural. I loved both past and present equally. I guess my only criticism would be that I saw the ending coming a mile away and wish it had been a little more flushed out. Still, I'm putting five stars because overall it was amazing.

There was one aspect of it that rubbed me really wrong-although the author was correct in her reason for doing it. I enjoyed that it was a romance, but it wasn't soppy and the heroes and heroines weren't unbelievable. They were nuanced and realistic and about more than a sappy romance. I love some history with my romance. I recommend it to those who appreciate carefully researched historical novels and authors who can really tell a story."

Her hero, Moray, played off nicely against Graham, as well, with enough of a difference to render Graham interesting in his own right.  From the fullest, I was afraid I was in for another rendition of Outlander, but thankfully it was its own story.  I even was interested enough to do some browsing on the history of James and his attempts to reassert his right to the throne.  Looking forward to reading more of her work."

Author Carrie McClelland travels to Scotland and on her drive through Cruden Bay she has an intensive pull to Slains Castle. Unbeknownst to her, her ancestor \"Sophia\" was at this castle during the \"Jacobite\" years and her story begins flowing through Carrie. Carrie can see, feel and almost touch what Sophia lived. It was an interesting saga between current time and the early 1700's. What a great story that intertwines a part of lesser known history! Loved it"

Beardsley writes with a measured cadence that is mesmerizing- you want to wrap yourself into the fiction, luxuriate in it, and let yourself be led this way and that. A snappy, fast paced chick lit this is not.  Historical fiction,  steeped with an aching windswept memory and the Jacobite cause makes you think deeply on those who gave their lives and fought and died for their king and country.  Lovely characters, thoughtful, soulful and well intentioned.  Highly recommend."

Two parallel tales are woven, separated by 300 years but taking place in the same seaside Scottish hamlet. Beautiful romantic settings are painted, and historical events are treated with care and well-researched. Perfect for late winter/early spring reading when there's still a brisk chill in the air but you can feel the spring sun approaching. History buffs and romance fans will enjoy this novel."

HOWEVER the description said \" But when she discovers her novel is more fact than fiction, Carrie wonders if she might be dealing with ancestral memory, making her the only living person who knows the truth-the ultimate betrayal-that happened all those years ago, and that knowledge comes very close to destroying her\" ... I NEVER read about any \"ultimate betrayal\" and the heroine Carrie never \"came close to being destroyed\" I'm honestly not sure where such a description came from!!! I could go into more detail about parts of the book that bothered me but I don't want to list any spoilers for future readers. This is a good read on a rainy afternoon but don't expect a deep plot and fully developed characters."

The Winter Sea is about an author, Carrie. Carrie\u2019s characters talk to her as she writes their story.  She becomes aware that she might be related to these people. This is an almost impossible idea to her.  However, the more she writes, the more she questions this theory. The story takes place in Scotland at the character\u2019s family castle.  She moves to the area for the ambiance to help her write the story.  She has unbelievable feelings of her surroundings during her stay.  Her father keeps her grounded until he begins to wonder about her knowledge prior to his finding it in his research. This is a story takes place during the 1700s. Ms. Kearsley\u2019s descriptions are so real you feel the place and see what she sees through her eyes. Her research shows her talent for making it all work into a fantastic mystery."

She weaves real places and history into the story line.  It allowed me to find the locations and some of the historical characters on the Internet so I could \"see\" what her characters were seeing.

Her seamless weaving of past to present, the depth of her characters and the level of historical research engage me in much the same way Diana Gabaldon's work does. Of all her books (after having read Winter Sea I have scarfed down almost all her books), Winter Sea will remain my favorite for its beauty of storytelling."

It's as though, because she loves her readers and wants them to be happy, Kearsley decided to give us, not only a happy ending with Sophia, but a really great twist on the family of her modern-day main character's love interest. Real, raw emotions could be felt throughout the story and I found myself truly caring about the characters. Even if you read this and its sequel (kind of) out of order like I did, the story is equally fulfilling because you see how characters' relationship s develop and you know the later days of main characters and can thus be gifted with both anticipation and surprise at the outcome. I'm geeking out a bit here! Onto the next Kearsley book!"

                "Text": "The Winter Sea is one of the most enjoyable history lessons I've had the pleasure of reading. Susanna Kearsley is a gifted story teller that uses many actual events and persons to weave an engaging story of love, loss and perseverance. When I read a good historical fiction it always makes me wonder why the subject at school was usually so very dry and dull. Fans of The Outlander series will enjoy a similar style of writing and character development. I will be looking forward to more of Ms. Kearsley's work."

I know the book is popular, so I am surprised that I kept putting it down and not feeling inclined to pick it up again (I did, of course, but without great enthusiasm).  I did like the main characters, the setting, and the general plot, but I guess I found the contemporary heroine's \"genetic memory\" of the events of the past rather unconvincing. I usually enjoy psychic or paranormal elements, but this felt a little too heavy-handed to me. I do intend to read her other novels, though, since I was impressed with her writing and her historical research."

I especially connected with her use of 'the doric' accent, as this is how my grandparent's spoke. They were from the same region in Scotland. So many of Kearsley's references took me back to my childhood memories - even the foods she described. My aunties fixed our family oatcakes, scones and shorties. I've always enjoyed the blending of history, a bit of romance, and a wee bit of the mystical."

I will warn you, there is a good chance towards the end you may cry, so have some tissues handy."

I can't decide now which is my favorite!  I love the unexpected plot development and twists and turns.  Just could not put it down.

And that's not so different from so many other books- most of the historical romances I read I can predict. What made this book, to me, so delicious was the way it was written. I have the quote from here hanging on my wall now: \"Where'e'er I go, my Soul shall stay with thee: 'Tis but my Shadow that I take away\" Being in love with a sailor, this book touched my soul. I ached with loving and love with the characters. It left me contemplating a lot of things, and that to me is the very point of an excellent book. This book took me on a journey and left me both sad to see it end and thinking about it well after it ended."

Although all of her books have a paranormal twist of some sort, she creates engaging characters and she has a great sense of history, so the flow is good and the read is fun and enjoyable.  This was the first one of her books I read, and I enjoyed it so much I've read three more.  If you're not a fan of paranormal explanations and/or historical novels, this may not be your cup of tea.

In her books so far her main characters seem to always go from present day to a distant past,  each time in a different way. She also has a wonderful way of drawing you in to the characters, where you want to keep reading to see what happens next. I am so glad I have discovered her work, and look forward to her other books"

I knew I had seen that name before, I went back and found it. My fathers family is from Scotland.  This was exciting.

Something about the cover, the 'look' of it just did not appeal. I've no idea exactly why. I finally did get it though and proceeded to lose sleep the past two nights reading. I loved it! I was so saddened to reach the end and know I was leaving these characters and I can give no higher praise to any book. It's haunting, the locations so real I could feel the mist and spray around me.....so well written. These people seemed to leap off the page at me, drawing me into their worlds both old and new. I've not read anything previously by this author but i surely will be now. Although I can not imagine that anything she has written before or since will strike me with the same impact that this book did.  I am hopeful her other titles will be so engrossing to me as this one was."

I saw a review by someone I respect so I decided to read this one. I was sold by the fact that it takes place in a castle on the Scottish shores. This was decent historical fiction with a bit of supernatural as the contemporary character, Carrie, a writer of historical fiction starts to feel she is writing her story from memories, not research. The historical story about Sophie, an orphan living with a wealthy relative who is part of a conspiracy to bring King James II back to his rightful place on the throne of England. The history was interesting, the story compelling. There was romance and I even enjoyed it. This is a great weekend read. I think I will read another by this author."

                "Text": "This is a heartfelt, yet mysterious novel. The plot is brilliant. A novelist begins writing a novel that has her enthralled--she rents a cottage on the coast of Scotland, in view of the ruins of Slaine Castle. As she writes the novel, she discovers that research she's doing confirms the historicty of what she thought to be the fiction of her own creation. As her novel, her past life, and her current life become entwined together, a love story from the past and a new one emerging in the present are told with a deeply felt voice. I love Ms. Kearsley's works--they are quiet, mystical, and breathtaking."

A writer moving to Scotland to research an historical novel, duel romances in this time and in 1708, memories coming through DNA, a couple of good plot twists, highly atmospheric.  The only thing I would have liked more of was a more literary feel to the prose.  While it did provide beautiful, well crafted sentences occasionally, its style was more often than not just matter of fact.  The author took on a lot of history, maybe more than the story itself required. But to learn while being entertained is never wasted.  I recommend this to readers who like a good romance with paranormal overtones, to history buffs of the Jacobite era, and those wishing to experience a bit of Scotland. I would love to see this one as a movie.  The scenery alone would elevate the story to a wonderful experience..."

I was expecting more of a modern fantasy thriller type novel.  What I got was a modern day romance novel (but not a graphic bodice ripper) interlaced with a historical fiction romance novel set in 18th century Scotland.  This isn't a genre I choose very often.  Still the premise of the modern heroine being descended from the ancient one was a unique twist and it was a good story.  The historical fiction part seemed to be pretty well researched, although I am no expert.  I found the style somewhat reminiscent of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  All in all this infrequent reader of Historical Romance novels enjoyed this accidental find."

I totally recommend this book.  I downloaded it from my library website for free.  I have a 14 day rental period from the library, but finished this in less than 5 hours.  I loved the characters, the setting and the overall vibe of this book.  I laughed, I cried and I was completely immersed in the lives of all involved."

This book is not a time travel book but can sometimes make you feel it is. She does a fantastic job knowing when to end one time period and begin the other in order to keep her reader intrigued and anxious to find out what they have missed while in another century. Beautiful writing that puts you right where the book takes place and when you're done you want to go back. She gives us the joy of reading the romance of two different couples with both heroines being strong, smart women and the heroes being stoic and mysterious. SK is known for her ability to mold the romance between the H/H with such passion but leaves out the explicit sex scenes....I am one that love an explicit sex scene....but I find I am still very satisfied with her version. SK is one of the few authors that I purchase the actual book even though I own a Kindle."

I found myself thinking about the plot while at work. I found that I could relate to BOTH characters even though one was based 300 years in the past. I've never really gotten into historical fiction (I'm afraid history in school was not a favorite) but the way the author interpreted it actually made me sit up and pay attention (please take note of this Mr. Griffith) and I wanted to learn more about the history of Scotland and the fight to control the crown. I do realize how religion plays a role in history, past and current, but it always intrigues me to learn the lengths that people will go to prove something instead of just doing the morally right thing. Hmm I feel I've regressed off the book but it was such an eye-opener to me. Bravo. Two-thumbs up. Buy this book for yourself and one for your friend to read as well so you have someone to discuss it with :)"

I loved it in both formats - in fact, I often read along on my Kindle while listening to the audiobook (narrator: Rosalyn Landor). I truly had a difficult time taking breaks because I was so caught up in the story - or stories - of both modern-day Carrie and Jacobite Sophia. The characters were so real to me, as were the relationships - some true and faithful, some deceitful. I enjoyed the intensity of the love relationships of the couples whose stories are told, without all the unnecessary details. I also thoroughly appreciated learning more of the true history of the period. I have happily recommended this book to others and do so again here. It is a story to think about long after the read is done."

Winter Sea is one of those books. I felt the romances were handled tastefully and could stand proudly without the typical smutty descriptions of love scenes that normally accompany Scottish romances. Kearsley also weaves history in with the present day in a very fluid manner. I felt like I gained an intriguing passionate history lesson with none of the boring parts. Indeed, I think the author convinced me to be a Jacobite myself."

The cover looked interesting and the few reviews it had made it sound like a good book.  I am not normally a fan of historical fiction but decided to give it a try and I am happy I did.  At first the book was rather slow and I found myself wishing that I could just follow Carrie's story and not Sophia's but this changed after the first couple of chapters.  I think the problem with those chapters was that similar things happen to Carrie and Sophia so some of the story seems repetitive, however at some point after that I think when all the main characters and the background are introduced the story flows very well between the past and modern day.  The author does a really good job of setting up the historical background and I really appreciated her use of one of the main character's as a history professor to summarize the historical events that occurred at different points in the book.  Although the direction of the story was slightly predictable overall this book is well written, I enjoyed reading it, and I would purchase it if I had not gotten it as a free kindle book."

I finally decided to try it this summer and have been searching for something like it again.  It was wonderful and the history in it rich and accurate.  I have since read Outlander which I would also highly reccomend, but found The Winter Sea to be more accurate to names/dates/places if that is important to you.  Author did a nice job bouncing between then and now and not confusing me along the way, which sometimes happens.  Between the two books I am starting a savings to make a trip to Scotland/Ireland to see the lands myself.  Excellent book!"

After finishing this book (in the wee hours of the morning this morning), I woke up knowing I had to write a review.  This was a wonderful book, with great characters and a really interesting concept.  I am a fan of books set in Scotland, both present and past (think Diana Gabaldon), and this hit the mark in both centuries.  The author didn't get too caught up in the historical aspect in terms of describing how castles were cleaned, lit, etc., but the characters are marvelous and the book flowed really well.  There are a couple twists and turns that made the book even more enjoyable.  I highly recommend you read this book, and I hope the author publishes more soon."

There is definitely historical aspects to the book, but it all seemed secondary to the romance aspects.  I did finish the book, but it was a chore.  I could have even given it 1 more star if I even cared about the romance.  I did not find the female lead character to be likeable, she seemed too full of heself for my liking (the modern \"heroine\"). I read alot of historical fiction books and this did not hold up."

Think of this as Outlander \"lite\". No bodice-ripping, no real danger ocurring other than in flashbacks, no real evil antagonist, no angst. Good historical read, great descriptions and really not a bad little book; it just doesn't have any \"UMF!\". Still, well written and interesting enough to keep me going. Cute characters. Totally PG rated. Beatiful descriptions and fun coincidences in this story-within-a-story."

I left it to read another book, as did a previous reviewer. and had to force myself to go back and finish it. I kept waiting for that \"magical, tear inducing moment\" and it never came. Probably because it was so very predictable. I also did not 'buy' the whole Anna situation. My biggest problem with this book though is the \"Mary Sue-ish\" main character Carrie. I just could not stand her or care about her. Sophia wasn't much better and slightly insipid. Both were bores. I do not see any similarity in this book to the writings of the great Anya Seton AT ALL and as a fan of Ms. Seton I find the comparison a bit insulting and nothing more than a marketing ploy. Also where was the moment that would \"almost destroy\" Carrie that was a cover blurb? Did they mean Sophia? Otherwise I must have missed it. I did give extra stars for the historical accuracy."

With that said, this book in my opinion was just as good if not better than Outlander.  It had a brilliant plot that flowed beautifully throughout the book.  The characters were very well done.  All in all I would give this book more stars if I could.  Please Amazon, put Susanna Kearley's other novels on Kindle."

I loved the Scottish setting, in both time periods, the brogues, the characters, the back stories, and, above all, the love stories. I shed more tears than I have over a book in a long time but came away feeling fulfilled and sated. What a wonderful book. Shades of Bronte, I recommend it to all readers, not just fans of romance."

                "Text": "** Some spoiler alerts** I absolutely loved this book.  I bought it on a whim as I love story lines set in Scotland with history in them.  After reading a few of the books in the Outlander series I was unsure how this would measure up.  With both books having an emphasis on the Jacobite uprisings I was uncertain if I could enjoy this as much as I wanted.  My hesitation disappeared after reading for a few minutes.  This is one of the most beautiful and touching stories I have read in some time.  I did not care for how easily the physician suggested genetic memory for the reason Carrie was remembering Sophie's life... it seemed too hard to believe, although I do understand providing an explanation for how she can know the memories of another person. I am not one to cry over books and movies but this book brought me to tears on more than one occasion.  Two of the occasions I could not hold back tears I was teased by my husband who has no love for reading as he tried to understand how I could derive pleasure from a story that reduced me to tears.  The descriptions of the circumstances that made me cry were so vivid and real that I could not help but get caught up in the story.  I struggled mightily with Sophie leaving her daughter to be raised by others -- I understand her desire to keep her child safe, but once the world believes her husband to be dead I cannot understand what danger the child would be in.  As a mother myself I went back and forth -- ensure the child's safety by leaving her to be part of another family or bring her and risk the chance the evil characters in the book would hunt them down to harm a child they did not even know existed... For me this was also hard to believe/comprehend.  I do also wish that more of the story line between Carrie and her love interest had a chance to be developed a little more.  There scenes together were few and far between and left me wanting to know more about them together.  All in all, my criticisms are few as I enjoyed this book more than I expected.  I had such a difficult time getting the characters out of my thoughts for the next day or two after reading the story.  I can't wait to read more by this author."

                "Text": "This was my first introduction to this author's work; and with that said be prepared to stay up late for a few nights to read this novel and get lost in the worlds that Susanna Kearsley has created. Told from several different points of view, she's created such a enviable, mysterious, and heart-aching romance against the backdrop of a little known course of historical events that once you get started, you will not want to put this down. It's hard to write a review without giving the story away, but be prepared with a box of tissues and faith in the author to create an ending that we've all expected since meeting the four main characters. If you pay close attention to how she weaves the two time periods together, you'll be able to come to the same conclusions I had about the ending and be satisfied with this amazing novel."

I bought this as a Kindle Deal of the Day, and I could not be happier with it. I could not put it down, and I stayed up until 1am finishing it. I am a sucker for historical fiction, but I did not know it was a romance genre. I can't say that I have often read many true romance novels (I see that she received Romance-genre awards for this book), but this book far exceeded by expections. I appreciate the author's ability to create such vivid scenes. I was holding out for a twist, and, while I was able to guess at it a chapter earlier, the story was not ruined for me. I will definitely seek out other books by this author"

However, I knew basically nothing about the Jacobite invasion so hearing all the names and events for the first time was a little overwhelming and caused the story to drag a bit for me.  The descriptions of the scenery and life on the Scottish coast kept me turning the pages.  I also enjoyed the parts about Carrie's writing process and her nomadic way of going where the story takes her.  I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys historical fiction with a little romance thrown in."

This could not be further from the truth. The history in Winter Sea read like a text book. There are two romantic story lines in this book. One in the present, which is lacking, and one in the past, which has promise, but becomes boring. If you are looking for more history than romance, or action, then this is the book for you. Meanwhile I will keep searching for books to keep me occupied until Written in My Own Hearts Blood comes out next year."

                "Text": "This is the story about an author named Carrie, who writes historical fiction novels. She travels to Scotland to research Slains Castle for her newest novel and to spend some time with her editor who lives there. While she is there the characters of her book come alive in her memory. She is actually remembering the life of her ancestor, Sophie Paterson and her marriage to John Murray. While writing her book she meets a man named Graham and a romance starts. \"The Winter Sea\" jumps back and forth from the story Carrie is writing to Carrie's life in the present as she writes the story. I enjoyed reading about Carrie's romance, but reading the parts that were Carrie's book bored me. In the end it turns out that Graham is actually a descendant of Sophie Patterson as well. Carrie and Graham are kissing cousins! Cool.... I guess?"

When the characters spoke with a Scottish accent and was written that way, you had to sit and figure out what the heck they were saying.  That would be worthwhile if they had anything to say that WAS worthwhile.  If I had stayed with this book, maybe it would have gotten better, but I had better things to do and better books to read than wait and find out."

I can't give it five stars, however, because of the lack of morals of the heroine in the present day story who slept with the hero before marriage. It would have been a much more delightful story, in my opinion, to have both the hero and heroine waiting for a wonderful marriage, and perhaps showing that marriage.

The double plots that mirror each other are ridiculous and unimaginative - additionally, the \"twist\" is predictable.  I finished it hoping against hope that it would get better, but it certainly didn't.  Beyond disappointing."
