                "Text": "This book is not for the physics novice. I found some of the technical parts very difficult to follow, so I just skimmed those, without feeling that I missed anything. Since the main point of the book is to discuss what is supported by data versus what isn't, it didn't really matter that I did not understand everything. Author Jim Baggot's book did make me feel better about the poor review I gave to Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe.  Baggot writes in a very conversational tone and with a good sense of humor. Even his footnotes will amuse so I recommend you read those. Baggot will also make highly theoretical statements but then back them up with concrete, everyday examples. I recommend this book for anyone very interested in the history of physics or just in physics but I do not recommend it for the casual reader."

                "Text": "No, I'm not a new age guy, nor a religious fundamentalist. Indeed, I am a scientist and philosopher of science, so I have knowledge of, and deep appreciation for, the scientific enterprise. Besides, some of my best friends are physicists... Still, Baggott's book is a very welcome addition to a small group of books written by people with strong physics background and who are nonetheless somewhat critical of certain trends in contemporary fundamental physics, what Baggott refers to as \"fairy tale physics,\" that is physics that looks a lot like metaphysics. (Other entries in the same genre are Peter Woit's Not Even Wrong and Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics.) Baggott takes aim at what he sees as the increasingly worrisome disconnection between theoretical and experimental physics, with theoretical physicists apparently feeling increasingly at liberty to propose theories based on other theories, presenting them especially to the general public as actual accomplishments of their science, as opposed to the interesting speculative ideas that they really are. Check out also a couple of entries at the Rationally Speaking blog about themes from Baggott's book."

He explains commonly understood concepts, such as helium atoms consisting of two protons and two neutrons, in enough detail for the non-scientist, but then talks about the \"zoo\" of subatomic and super-symmetric particles with a minimum of explanation, such that I, with a Ph.D. in physics had trouble following it.  I agree completely with his description of String, Brane, M theory and multiple universes as \"fairy tale\" physics.  They qualify as a faith-based religion, but without a supreme being, and without the possibility of revelation as a source of authority. I learned early in my studies that physics does a good job of explaining how things work, but not why."

I started as a teen watching the first Nova programs on tv. I read the popular book by Einstein on relativity in high school. I endeavored to master the math but couldn't quite get there. I became a technologist instead and voraciously read all the popular books on physics I could find. I am a lifelong subscriber to scientific American. But with the multiverse theories and d-brands I became disenchanted. Maybe Einstein was wrong about quantum theory but his insight into unexplained variables seems right. Read this book to understand why someone who has followed the physics world for 50 years is upset about the attach on science from both the religious and the physicists."

Very sad situation, since there are voices claiming that the scientific method should be weakened in order to accommodate the fact that current Physics, particularly String Theory Physics, has made a card castle out of piling unprovable theory upon unprovable theory, just because the math is great. Apparently some scientists cannot get the idea that math alone does not necessarily represent reality..I will repeat myself, but Physics seems to be entering a very dangerous Age of Faith."

It reviews and compares current thinking and suppositions in theoretical particle physics and cosmology versus physic learning's acquired via the standard scientific method or rational empiricism approach (i.e. data based rather than supposition) .  Net the book presents an engaging summary of current pronouncements in theoretical physics and cosmology with the caveat that these are not based on concrete tests, data or evidence.  It is a good read for those familiar with the standard model of particle physics (Hadrons, quarks, etc.) and exposure to current cosmological considerations such as Inflation of the Universe."

                "Text": "The strength of this book is in Baggott's clear descriptions of the various fringe ideas in modern physics. His challenges to such things as String Theory and the Anthropic Principle are well argued. The book falls short in its foundational pages. The first chapter, where he makes a perfunctory foray into epistemology, he sets forth some rules to guide the reader in the following chapters.  This front part of the book, I found was presumptuous, as I was left wondering what Bertrand Russell, Hume, or Kant would have thought Baggott accomplished in 8 pages what took them entire books to do...see \"Human Knowledge\" by Russell or \"the Critique of Pure Reason\" by Kant. I hope I am not being unduly harsh, but the author's book is titled with then word \"reality\" and Baggott's statement in the first 8 pages, where he writes that he has now put to rest, \"what we can and can't know about reality\" was founded on simplistic arguments that had little, if any rigor.  He made some sound arguments why some fringe ideas in current physics are not scientific...especially String Theory...but he did not balance his thoughts with historical perspectives on other theories that, in their times, were also fringe...atomism for one..."

                "Text": "A lost opportunity to signal the flaws of modern physics. Baggot does well when he point to the many idiocies and witching ideas that fill up the theoretical physics discourse nowadays, but he is too condescending with the idiocies, as when he accepts the discussion of reality, and does not strongly rejects the ''need for other ways of thinking'' of physicists like Susskind or Greene, ''other ways'' meaning everything is O.K. including dragons, centauri or sirens. Our brain has the ability of biulding images of horse with human torsos, but these images are unable to build these creatures to live on. Similarly, we are able to imagine many universes,  time when there was no time, theories with 10 to the 10 to the .... power of parameters, and imagining every combination of what we already know. We can imagine food, but with that irreal food we die of hunger. Galileo Galilei gave a recipe to separate imagination from reality, and that recipe is as valid today as then: Test your imaginations in the laboratorium under strictly controlled conditions. If they cannot be validated or if they are falsified, they are wrong, and that is as right for imaginary food as for multiverses. Baggott signal the perils of going on on that direction, but does it in 'correct political way'', when we need a strong rejection of these approaches to science."
