Even though old (written c. 1986), it has not lost its charm and magic to me. The best part of this book is the beautifully rendered  paintings of the night skies and other sights around the universe, which  will leave you breathless and in awe of the majestic canvas of the skies. I  give it a 2 thumbs up and many stars!"

The constellation maps are the easiest to use out of any I have seen. If you are thinking about buying a telescope for your child, you may want to get this book first. It will help you make a decision about how to buy your first telescope, and ensure that your child knows what he or she is looking at."

The stargazing sections give a useful, though basic, guide to the night sky for each season, taking the reader logically from one constellation to another. References to the locations of the planets span 1987 to 1999. Don't look to this book if you want to know where to see the planets tonight. Despite that, the book was worth buying as a first introduction to astronomy."

The illustrations are incredible, particularly the artist's renderings in the first section of the book, which takes a journey from our solar system to beyond our galaxy.  The second section details the night sky during different seasons of the year.  I highly recommend this book."
