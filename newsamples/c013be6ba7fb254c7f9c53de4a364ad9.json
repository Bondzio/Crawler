                "Text": "I first read about this book a few months ago.  While I am a fan of Stephen King, I'm not a huge fan.  I don't typically buy his books the day they are released, but when I read the premise for this one I just thought that it was a really neat idea and I couldn't wait for it to be released so that I could read it.  Then I got a little nervous about it.  From the time I read the teaser I thought that there were so many interesting directions that someone could take this story, but what if it tanks?  That's always the pitfall of a really neat idea...  what if it fails to really bloom like you think it could?  But this is Stephen King.  For my review, I'd like to establish that I was born almost 7 years after JFK died.  I am not a JFK scholar and I did not read this book trying to hyper-analyze the historical accuracy of the book.  I took it as a fictional exploration of a historical event produced not to answer any historical questions but just to entertain and provoke thought.  I feel it was very successful on both points.  My fears that Stephen King was going to take a great idea and go nowhere with it were definitely unfounded.  He also works in all his usual Stephen King \"givens\"...  the story starts in Maine.  We even get to \"visit\" a couple of characters from other Stephen King books and the town of Derry, though the majority of the book is set in Texas of course.  On the whole I usually review books based on how well spent I feel my time was in reading it and I am in no way disappointed in this one.  If you buy the book I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and thank you for taking the time to read my review."

                "Text": "When I first started the book I could not put it down. I cried a lot from certain events and a weapon that I didn't expect. I got through a 1/3 of the book in a couple of days. When I got to the middle of the book, I felt it really got dragged out.  I understood why the book was written the way it was. It was like reading a journal. The stalking of Oswald was driving me insane.It was overkill in my opinion. I felt after 200 pages I got it, your stalking him. This caused me to feel detached from certain secondary characters deaths or injuries.I just wanted the book to go to the next level. I was very pleased with the end of the book. Once you get to April of 1963 the book goes back to a nail bitting page turner. The ending had a sweet touch. I wished the emotional impact from the beginiing and ending were in the middle as well."

                "Text": "No spoliers! Okay. As some others have written, the book has a wonderful, grabber opening. I was taken in by the premise. But, the entire middle section of the book is tedious. Simply, this book should have been 300 pages and not the 800+ that was written. (Amazingly, this is my first Stephen King book, and will probably be my last.) I am stunned by the five and four star review. I just found myself skimming over the entire middle portion of the book. I was curious about the ending so, I gathered my courage, and plodded on. I just could not endure the detail, upon unnecessary detail. (I have refrained from the details of the middle portion to avoid spoliers.) Take book out of the library or borrow a copy. Great premise ruined by the author's desire to overwhelm us with the past and the details of an interetsing time traveller."

                "Text": "I think it has been years since I have been able to get through a King book. I've thought of his recent efforts as a sad decline in quality.  I was a huge fan of his earlier work, his collections of short stories, The Stand, IT etc.  But in the past five years I've pretty much felt that he has lost it.  This book, however, is wonderful.  Does the actual writing compare to his earlier efforts? In my opinion, no, but it doesn't matter.  This is still the King of old, a book you do not want to put down, even if you have to stay up all night to read it.  It isn't the masterpiece that I felt The Stand was, nor as beautifully written as some of his older short story collections, but there is much to love in this newest effort.  It is a satisfying ride, and you are sad when it ends."

I literally feel like a chapter in my life is over now that I'm finished with it. You feel SO close to the characters and they are so well developed you hurt with them, laugh with them, cry often and feel every moment as the minutes count down to the climax of the book. It is amazing. By far the BEST Stephen King book I have EVER read. I don't know how he will follow this one up. I have never been a big Stephen King fan, but this book has literally changed my life. It is amazing. Good luck stopping because you eat, breathe, sleep, walk, work, etc. George Amberson/Jake Epping."

Man goes back to before JFK was killed an attempts to prevent the assassination.  The beginning of this book and most of the end are excellent.  Full of action, suspense, and surprises.  The problem is the extremely long middle of the novel - the bridge between the setup and the conclusion.  There is simply not enough of interest going on.  There are some cute scenes and ideas (creating buzz words long before their time) but this part simply drags.  This might have been a great short story of even a novella.  So because of the problems with the middle section, even thought I basically enjoyed the book, I will not be recommending it to my friends."

                "Text": "The notion of time rifts in the form of small \"bubbles\" was a facinating premise and King's prose is, as always absorbing.  But I expected much more from this book.  Over 3/4ths of it, I'd say, was a lead up to that fateful day followed by an all too brief aftermath and wrap up.  Seriously.  We spend page after page and chapter after chapter in this quiet little Texas town, endearing ourselves to rather ordinary characters.  That and watching our hero stalk Oswald around Dallas/Ft Worth.  Then, when we finally get to the part we've all been waiting for, poof.  It's over.  Of course we boomers have been wondering all our lives how things would have been different if Kennedy had lived.  How would the civil rights struggle evolved? Would Kennedy have been re-elected? Would he have escalated the conflicts in SE Asia? What about the Great Society, would anything like it have been pushed through without LBJ's arm-twisting from the oval office?  Women's reproductive rights?  Would the moral majority have sprung up and pulled the republican party so far right?  Would our path with Kennedy have veered away from these and other social currents and if so, where might it have taken us?  King gives us a bare glimpse at what we came for, a very brief passage and then the book is over, aside from an highly sentimental closing tug at the heartstrings. I wish he's given us more."

However, I quickly discovered that this was very different from his previous novels. It reads almost a bit like historical fiction with a hint of King's supernatural and spooky style. I absolutely loved this book and found it difficult to put it down. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. As usually, I found myself astounded by King's creativity and originality. I cannot recommend this book enough, and it's important to note that for those who are not fans of Stephen King, put that aside and read this book anyway. I think you will be most pleasantly surprised!"

Loved Under the Dome and much of King's previous work...but this novel, I feared, being based on historical fact, left me feeling a bit apprehensive. The beginning of the book, while interesting, seemed a bit slow. However, the last 200 pages are beyond a thrill ride! All said, this book has stayed with me for several days...and I think it will stay with me for many more days to come. Don't want to give too much away...but the ending is very satisfying and left a tear in my eye. However, the editors missed one huge glaring error: On page 781, Jackie Kennedy refers to her two young children, and Jake remembers them as Carolyn and John. How King's editors missed the fact that \"Carolyn\" is really Caroline is beyond me!!! HUGE error! For those of us who lived through the assassination and its aftermath, this is a marvelous \"what if\" tale. One of King's best."

                "Text": "I haven't read a King novel in twenty years or more, though he was my favorite writer when I was a young teen.  As I got older and became more exposed to real brutality and horror in our world, I got more and more sensitive to reading fictionalized stories that contain graphic violence and disturbing scenes.  I have run out of things to read and saw the great reviews and thought, what the heck, I'll give it a shot.  Maybe I've just outgrown King, but I found this book to be very formulaic, predictable, well-crafted but not great.  I didn't like the protagonist's narrative voice.  I don't ever want to hear the word \"obdurate\" (the reference to the past as \"obdurate\" is made 25 plus times, and reference to the past \"harmonizing with itself\" was made as many times or more).  Toward the end I started wondering if it was really King who wrote this novel, or the writer who wrote \"Shades of Gray\".  Only this wasn't porn, it was just overuse of the same words, over and over and over again.  And the word \"obdurate\" is not a word that you hear in everyday language, so its overuse jumps out at you throughout the novel, I also thought the book started really dragging halfway through.  The last several chapters were painful to read.  There was the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" scene toward the end when the protagonist runs through the town (only the town is different, because of changes made to the obdurate past).  There was the predictable ending, better when Ray Bradbury did it.  This will be my last attempt to read a King novel.  Not gory or graphic, just plain bad."

                "Text": "When I first heard the concept of Stephen King's new novel, I was skeptical. The idea of someone finding a way to travel back through time and stop the Kennedy assassination seemed like something far more generic and B-movie-esque than I hoped for from King. But, hey, it's King, so of course I'll try it...and I wasn't ten pages in before my doubts started to fade. One of the things I forgot in my expectations is how well King can make even the oddest scenario seem both logical and yet completely fresh, and his handling of the time-travel method here is both, creating something that feels like no other time travel story I've ever heard in my life, yet one that feels...well, natural in a way you might not expect. But more than that, 11/22/63 is a testament to King's storytelling skills: this thing moves like a rocket, and there are scattered climaxes and scenes that pack such impact that I had to take a break afterward. King puts on a clinic with regard to pacing, structuring his story deftly and juggling dozens of characters so well that it looks effortless - only to collide them in ways you're never prepared for. It's those characters, of course, that really carry the book - you'd expect nothing less from King, whose character work is always second to none, but his cast of characters here is something special, something far more touching and complex than I might have expected. Maybe it's because for King, the past isn't a gimmick - it's a vibrant, fully-realized place, one that's as much a character as any of the people that inhabit it. There's so much more here to rave about, and so little space, so let me just say this: for my money, 11/22/63 is probably King's best book since the accident, and even one of his best, period. It's ambitious, profound, intense, unsettling, moving, and powerful, and it's the work of a master at the peak of his craft."

                "Text": "I'll start off by saying this was my first Stephen King novel, but I plan on reading more from him.  I was initially skeptical of this book since it appeared that most of the reviews were from people born in the baby-boomer era.  Clearly, these readers have ties to this book and the Kennedy incident.  However, I wanted to give it a shot and I found it to be both a good read and informative.  I learned a lot and the novel made me wish I could take a time machine back to the 60s!  King does a great job making the reader feel connected to the characters (the 850 pages didn't hurt either).  I found myself rooting for George/Jake and intrigued to see what life would be like if Kennedy survived.  I would actually give this novel 3.5 stars but I had to choose 3 or 4 so I went 4.  My only thing is I wish King would have given us more on the aftermath and about 150 pages could have been cut.  Other then that, great book!  I hear a movie is in the works and I am looking forward to it!"

I love the way King gently pulled me into the past and made the world he described not only real and believable, but filled with characters I both adored and hated. The interweaving of this tale through other stories in the SK universe was cool as well. Plus, the haunting presence of the obdurate past hanging over every page provided a level of tension I couldn't shake till the last page. I thought the ending was perfect, and even though I was left with a sense of foreboding and loss, I still honestly feel that the ending was true to the story."

While I was listening to Glen Miller's \"In the Mood\" (a reoccurring reference throughout the novel) recently, it illuminated scenes and memories from a book that I feel as though has afflicted me with happiness and melancholy.  The love story that arises from the main character and a librarian in the past is evocative writing and the suspense that slowly builds throughout the novel boils to a dramatic conclusion.  With an ending that I appreciated very much so and with storytelling that is performed masterfully, I cannot recommend this novel enough.  There is a clear reason why this book has garnered 500+ positive reviews since its release last month -- 11/22/63 is a treat, a delight, and a novel that deserves your reading crave."

Not a fascination, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but it is compelling. When I saw the 'what if' prospect surrounding one of the darkest days in American history, and then saw it was Steven King, I was on board for the ride. And I absolutely loved it. The characters are endearing, the eras vivid in my mind's eye, and the plot well crafted and engrossing. My only wish would be that King would have written this with more focus on what happened after the foiled attempt - I went into it with that mindset. That said, it was still a fantastic tale, and a great page turner. You won't be disappointed."

                "Text": "I don't think I've ever written a book review in all my years buying and reading books from Amazon.  (I HAVE reviewed a few products, though.)  However, this novel inspired me to write one as it's nothing short of amazing.  When I was a kid, I'd devour Stephen King's earlier novels such as Carrie, The Stand, The Shining, etc.  I ended up growing out of that \"horror\"/supernatural genre and moved on to what I thought at the time was more \"quality\" fiction.  Let me tell you, though... Mr. King has a resurrected (so to speak) fan in me with this novel.  I won't re-tell the story because others here have done that very well, but I do believe this is his best work ever and probably the best novel I've read in years. The characters are so real you can reach out and touch them (and you simply can't help but fall in love with Jake, a.k.a. George).  Not to mention that the pacing, the momentum, the suspense of this book are crafted brilliantly.  Whether you were \"alive\" or even aware when JFK was assassinated or not, this story will have you mesmerized.  I absolutely LOVED it!"

                "Text": "This book has some long, saggy subplots. I was enchanted by the visit to 1958, but we didn't get to experience much of that. THere were a few cultural icons that took me back, but not nearly enough to evoke the era. Instead, we are plunged into a seedy romance between characters without much spark. All we know about Sadie is that she is a chain smoker and is clumbsy... not enough depth to register any empathy. I, too, did research on the Kennedy assasination, and reached a very different conclusion than King has. That is forgivable, but the first 75% of the book was too slow moving, took me where I did not want to go, and bored me with paper thin characters. I endured to see how he would end it (and King fans endure the detours, we are used to them but hope they won't dilute the plot too much). The detour turned out to be the main story. The last 15% of the book is engaging though, and salvaged the whole story from being a huge flop in my opinion. It seems to be written for the big screen, using the lure of big screen sex and not much else."

Some reviewers are calling King the American Dickens and the case for that description is just getting stronger and stronger. As with Dickens, there are occasional slips (I find it hard to believe that anyone in 1960 said 'You rock!', and I laughed at the reference to a 'gorgeous man's wallet' - is that a gorgeous wallet designed for a man, or a wallet belonging to a gorgeous man? :) -- well, even Homer nods). But the book is a masterpiece by a novelist at the very top of his form...noble, heroic, eloquent."

I have not read The Stand (I actually just bought it to start reading -I mention The Stand because I see great reviews on it, but I can't compare this book to it since I haven't read it).  I have read a lot of his books though, and this one is my favorite so far.  While reading this book, I actually felt like I was with the main character on his journey.  I'm trying to be careful not to give anything away, so my review may not be as helpful as you'd like.  I can try to tell you what my taste is: I like Stephen King, John Grisham, and I liked the Harry Potter books.  (I also really liked the LOST television series).  I spent just about every free minute of this past weekend reading 11/22/63 and even though I really wanted to know what happened at the end, I was kind of sad when it was over. My sister had given me a book that she had by Mary Higgins Clark, but (forgive me if you are a fan)after reading 11/22/63, I have been forcing myself to read her book the past two nights and I found it to be boring in comparison (again, only my opinion so please don't take offense if you like her work).  I gave up on that and just went ahead and bought The Stand. 11/22/63 was probably my favorite book ever by any author.  Also, Stephen King said that the part of the book regarding the details of the assasination are based on facts; he did a lot of research to write the book."

But the subject of this one grabbed my attention.  When the Kindle price dropped, I got it.  This book is by far in the top 2 of books I've read in my life and I'm 57! Stephen King is brilliant.  I was drawn in from the first page.  This book has it all.  If you're in my age group, it reminds you of things long forgotten. There's history, mystery, Sci-Fi, and romance with each element having the power to trip over the others. Don't think you'll know how it turns out because you won't.  The end was quite literally in the last sentence.  somewhere in the middle of the book, my mind was exhausted, so I stopped to read something mindless, then went back to it.  When I finished it, I didn't start another book for days.  It haunted me and haunts me still.  You will ask yourself, \"what if I had done something else?  where would my life be today?\"  When a book has the power to entertain, think, question, and linger after the last word is read, you've got yourself a book!"

I thought that it might dwell too much on the assanation of JFK but much to my surprise, only about 25% of the book was actually about 11/22/63, although it was alluded to throughout the book.

                "Text": "With the publication of 11/22/63, Master SK has done something that I was doubtful would ever happen again. He has overwhelmingly silenced his critics, written a brilliant novel of depth and believability and created a work that slides effortlessly into the high five of his canon. Arguably, this is King's most poignant and human book to date. If you can buy the premise of a time portal residing in the corner of a greasy diner, the rest of the book is as palatable as anything the horror meister has ever written. For those who pay attention to foreshadowing, there are no surprise endings here. As King reminded us dozens of times, \"The past is obdurate.\" Perceptive readers will grasp very early what that means, but the beauty of this book is that it is so exceptionally developed and craftily constructed, that most of them just won't care. The motivation to read is encapsulated in the unfolding of the story. The journey is the reward, and I submit to you that it is one of the best journeys of recent years. Jake is the most unlikely hero imaginable: teacher, dullard, milquetoast. He embodies a certain everyman quality that all people can relate to, whether through personal reflection or acquaintance. His development is remarkable, made all the more so by actions that ring soundly of real-life decision making. He becomes what any of us might have, given the circumstances. Sadie is a grounded cornerstone of humanity and stability in the face of Jake's shaky and uncertain arc. She is one of the finest female characters King has ever written. As to other players from small-town barkeeps to no-town property owners to big-city reds, the supporting characters are almost all excellently rendered. I won't ruin it for those who have yet to read, but long-time King fans will be treated to Easter eggs that make you feel like you're in a special inner circle of author confidence. (wink, wink) In a time travel novel, the most critical element, and the trickiest to get right, is the conclusion. Too often, the reader is left with a bitter taste of disappointment. There are few other genre niches that are as rewarding to read about and as depressing to conclude as time travel. You will have no such issue here. I can say with certainty that this book ended exactly as it should have and that isn't to say that it ends the way I wanted it to. There is a moment in the last few pages that is as emotionally piquant as any SK has written and will live in my book memory for the rest of my life. Like it's characters, this book transcends time and space. I would not be surprised if 100-years hence, this novel is the one that has bibliophiles still applauding the name King."

                "Text": "This book took me way longer than it should have to read due to school and other projects but I'm glad I finally found the motivation to finish it. Time travel is always a touchy subject but this book didn't confuse me at all. Even the string theory at the end was understandable. I'm a sucker for conspiracy theories so this was fantastic. Though some was obviously fiction, the subject was compelling and changed my perspective and beliefs a lot. The romance was such a great touch to this story as well. Sadie and Jake (George) really made me happy and even though most guys aren't into romantic books, this one didn't over-do it. The first person narrative was awesome as well. I could put myself in those situations and I really felt like I was following the character through every page of this book. The parallels (aka \"Harmonies\") in this book are also fun to point out and notice. It's intense, fun, suspenseful, hilarious, and so much more. I've only read 3 of King's novels, including this one, and I have to say, it may be his best. I can't see how he can top it. The subject matter was so interesting and his opinions were excellent. I paid attention to every detail and reading this book was a total blast. I definitely recommend this book to fans of time traveling, romance, the late 50's and early 60's, humor, and first-person narratives. It was so incredible and I'm sad it's over. Please read this book. It should get more credit than it's been given."

                "Text": "I'm not sure what I can add that other readers have not already commented on, but here goes. The premise is good. There are a lot of holes in the story if you look carefully- probably could have been taken care of with a thorough editing.  One minor but typical example would be Al's purchasing of an entire day's worth of meat for his restaurant back in 1958 and bringing it back to the present...in one trip and completely by hand. Granted, time-travel is hard to swallow, but at least get the details to be believable.  It's hard to believe Al would be able to purchase a day's worth of meat and haul it up the stairs back into the present. Or why Al trusts Jake so much to reveal the secret of the bubble to Jake only, and why he is so obsessed with changing history.I think that the book could have been trimmed by a couple hundred pages and probably not lost any luster. I'll try and stay spoiler-free, but the first event in the past Jake changes (in Derry) reads great, as does his relationship with Sadie. The Oswald stuff got very repetitive and monotonous until the very end, which was engrossing. I liked the glimpse into the \"what-if\" scenario after Jake changes history. Perhaps what I liked best though, was the ending, which was pretty endearing and just a little sad."

However, in my opinion, after awhile reading his books became a chore and I had to stop reading him. After I saw him on the \"Today\" show last week, I was intrigued. So, I bought the Kindle edition and started reading. I was captivated by his main character, Jake, who is a very cerebral guy. He finds it so hard to believe in the ability to go back in time. When he finally agrees to go back to 1958 and try to prevent the Kennedy assasination, we follow along with all Jake's misgivings about what he's trying to do and why. When he falls in love with Sadie, I really hoped that they would be able to return to 2011 together. Although King did not end the book with a classical love story ending, I felt King's ending was very satisfying. I would implore any former King fans to BUY THIS BOOK. It's fantastic!!"

                "Text": "The premise of this book was very intriguing, and I was really hoping that King would do it justice. Sadly he drops the ball by making the novel painfully long, full of sappy, poorly-written romance and unrealistic relationships instead of an interesting exploration of American history in the fifties and sixties. When King is in his wheelhouse building tension and providing flash moments of fear, he is excellent. However, when he lingers too long on relationships he is out of his element. There is very little of the former and much of the latter. King's folksy, corny dialogue is very unnatural and often sounds like it was written by a high school student. He could have overcome this weakness by examining in more depth what it would be like for a person to have the opportunity to witness famous figures and events from the past and learn about the lives of older family members and friends. Instead, the cloying, uninspired love story takes precedence, making the book feel like little more than a wasted opportunity. There are some moments of intrigue, and I did feel that I learned more about the people and events surrounding the Kennedy assassination. Beyond that, reading 11/22/63 felt like time poorly spent. For King fans only."

                "Text": "Another fabulous work by Stephen King. Up until \"Under the Dome,\" I thought he was losing his magic. But since that one he hasn't missed, and he sure didn't miss with this book, any more than Oswald missed with his weapon on that Friday in Dallas. Paranoia is an old theme with King--in \"The Stand,\" it was the military and our national government. In \"Under the Dome,\" local government and law enforcement ran amuck. But now King has had a thought only he could even think--that a world with a living JFK could turn out worse than the screwed-up mess we live in today. Reading the book in audio form, as I did, added an entirely different dimension. The narrator, when speaking naturally, sounded for all the world like Sam Kinison. As the tale unfolded, he invented voices for the characters, and did excellent impression of famous voices who appeared in the book-Chet Huntley, David Brinkley, Walter Cronkite, and of course the man of the hour, JFK himself. What some dismiss as \"fluff,\" I thought really carried this story, and carried me along-the life Jake built with Sadie, Jake cooling his heels all those years waiting for that one day, then finding out it had all been a colossal bust. What a long strange trip this one was."

As a short loan, I thought for sure I'd have to stop halfway through and re-request it to finish it up later.  I actually got through the whole novel in 8 days, it was that good.  Yes, it's long, but unlike other longer novels I've read, it didn't seem to drag or have unimportant events in it that (had I been his editor) I would've taken out.  King is obviously a skilled writer, having been doing it for about as long as I've been alive, but I was still entranced by his characters and found myself wrapped up in the story.  When Jake runs into problems getting history to change, or running into problem after problem, I was on the edge of my seat.  I was rooting for him to get there and stop Oswald.  History is obdurate- that's the theme throughout the book.  Along the way, you'll meet many different characters who will touch your heart, make you smile, and keep you rooting for the good guys.  And there's even a little love story in there, for those who are closet romantics like myself."

The story is all-encompassing, and I put my life on hold to finish the book. I am 80s baby, but I still loved the depiction of the years 1958 to 1963. I really felt as though I was living in the story. The setting was painted perfectly and the characters felt so real. It was an extremely well-written book and the character development was out of this world. I am not a regular Stephen King reader by any stretch (the only other King novel I've read is Duma Key - another book I very much enjoyed), but this is a great book. Period. Whether it is outside his genre, it is an intriguing story that sucks you in. I did not guess the ending, however, it was in line with the rest of the book and I think the most perfect ending that he could have chosen. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an excellent read. Beware that it might take over your life until you finish!!!"

Although I didn't exist during that era, my mind's eye realized many of the staples of mid-century America as they came to life once more. The tinny, lilting pop music of the AM radios! The bright red Vendo machines chilling glass Co'Cola bottles! The ridiculously bulky and aerodynamically-challenged autos!  My palate yearned for that rich and frothy rootbeer that Jake-George Amberson-Epping had the fortune of dumping down his yap! Seriously though, I was quite surprised when, after delving into this novel because of the JFK content, I became even more engrossed in the lives of the rest of the characters! This book transports the reader and evokes some intense emotions along the way. The factual elements relating to the Assassination are accurate enough to ensure epic status IMO! AND YES, OSWALD DID IT ALONE!! Poo-Poo on the conspiracy-theorists!"

A lot of old time fans have given this one a bad review but I just finished it and must say it is an extremely well written book. Many have said he is too big for his britches now and needs to be edited, that the book is too long by half. I disagree. While it is more of a main stream novel than those I earlier mentioned, it is to me an instant classic. I learned a few years ago with movies and books that I could ruin them merely through my own expectations. I've gone back and reread books that I didn't like, this time with an open mind and no expectations, and have thoroughly enjoyed them the second time. After reading many of the poor reviews by long time fans I decided to read it anyway with no expectations and fell in love with this book.  GREAT JOB STEPHEN!!!"

And it surpasses that book by painting such an accurate picture of what life was like in the late 50s-early 60s you can practically taste the non-preservative laden food , smell the hair pomade , cigarette smoke , and exhaust from the vintage automobiles . One of King's best qualities has always been his meticulous descriptive powers and here they serve him very well relating both the good and bad of aspects of a time period with no internet or cell phones , but rather one with party lines , rotary dial phones and extremely gossipy neighbors . As with all time travel tales there is a price to pay for changing the time line and here as in other time altering stories the bigger the change the bigger the ripple effect . And as an unexpected bonus there is a small part where Jake Epping encounters characters from a previous King novel - really loved that part since it was from one of my all time favorite SK books ! I'll never forget when as a 6 year old in first grade the school principal interrupted the class with the news of the president getting shot - it was an event that literally stunned a nation . In the years since there have been many 'what if' stories of the president not getting assassinated , but I'd have to say this one is much more than that and the best of the genre . Mark me down as a very satisfied constant reader !"

As always, King provides great character development and excellent descriptive prose that makes me feel like I am back in the last 50's right along with the protaganist (even though I wasn't alive then!).  Full disclosure, I am only about halfway through the book, as I purchased it on CD to help get me through the long drives over the holidays, but I have been so into it that I have been listening to it even during a 5 minute drive.  So far, this book seems like King's more character/story driven books (like The Stand, The Shining) rather than the more supernaturally driven books (Pet Semetary, It), but that may change towards the end (as a lot of his books seem too). Either way, I am enjoying the ride."

Because of being a King book it is dark and not prone to the \"happily ever after\" of other books.  I found the book hard to put down even in the darker parts.  As for the history I found it very interesting, but this isn't a history book in the true sense.  It is a study of the characters and the times.  It spends most of the book giving you the feel of living in the late 50's and early 60's.  It provides very little information on the assasination or what the world would be like if Kennedy weren't assasinated.  The book is a novel.  The one thing I feared and most mentioned among my friends when I told them about reading it was that it might get really creepy, it was Stephen King after all.  The book did not and stayed true to itself as much as a time travel book can."

I can truly say that as a lifelong comic book fan and fan of such things as the Twilight Zone, this has become one of my favorite tomes of all time. Not embellishing.

He is my favorite author and he is, in many ways, the voice of his generation. 11/22/63 is definitely the best novel since at least Bag of Bones, and maybe even since The Dead Zone. How many of us long to change the past, to right past wrongs and avert past tragedies? This book is about that longing and ultimately also about living with the consequences of the events of the past. The plot is top notch, like the best of Stephen King's novels, and the book is populated with believable and well balanced characters. I tore through the whole book in a few days and really loved it. I highly recommend the book for King's fans and also those unfamiliar with his work since the book stands brilliantly on its own."

A compelling story told only as Stephen King could tell it, with a little bit of mystery mixed with romance, adventure and the occasional chill. The story is compelling and the book is a page turner. I couldn't help but think as I read this that King doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of all of the implications of the butterfly effect and what would happen if one went back in time and interacted with even just one person. King seems to opt for the easy, predictable ending; I must say I half expected something a bit more twisted. Instead, his ending borders on the sweet and poignant, contributing to an overall feel good and more than satisfactory reading experience."

                "Text": "I preordered this book the moment I became aware of it.  The date, 11/22/1963, was a life changing day for many members of Stephen King's and my generation.  It was the day that the world changed, where assassination was not a word you read in history books but a current event.  The idea of what would have happened had JFK lived is a fascinating one.  This book protrays the late 50's and early 60's as I remember them and it is a nice trip back to a time when the world felt like a safer place.  If we had the power to go back and change the past, would we and should we?  What would the consequences of altering history be?  These are the concepts King explores in this novel.  As a Stephen King fan, I would have made the journey in any case, but I found the ride truly a thrill."

The concept is intriguing enough, but it is the characters that really make it great.  Jake/George's falling in love with Sadie and all the consequences that follow are what kept me reading.  I personally enjoyed the minutiae of George's observations of Oswald's comings and goings.  I also think the portrayal of Oswald is very true to what is known about him.  But it was George coming to terms with what he had to do to stop Oswald and how it affected his relationship with Sadie that drove the story.  A really compelling, engrossing read that kept me interested for over eight hundred pages!"

I had read some Stephen King many years ago (Christine, Pet Semetery, Thinner) and while those were all good books, I never fully embraced his genre or niche.  So, being a little skeptical of Stephen King, but an avid reader of history, I picked this up and couldn't set it down until I was done and was sad it was over.  Although it is based on a watershed historical event, one does not need to be into the historical genre to appreciate this book.  I could visualize the characters and their environment every step of the way through the story telling and character development.  I could drone on and on about this book... but won't.  Just do yourself a favor and read it!"

I read the first 300 pages in a day, dragged a little on the next 300, and couldnt wait to read the last 200.  It had just enough of that other-worldly scenario, alternate universe timeline sci fi stuff, mixed in with actual events from real history.  Some people may not have liked the ending but I thought it was great.  Again, Ive read lots of Kings books and I definitely enjoyed this one.

The genre is time travel and it's informed by Jack Finney's (The Body Snatchers) Time and Again (highly recommended also), as well as Back to the Future--but familiar ideas are always transformed by King to transcend their original source. Although at 849 pages, the novel could've been edited for pace a little, you spend time in a world you regret leaving when the journey is done, and you regret leaving the characters even more. While it's difficult to review 11/22/63 without major spoilers, I can say that it's emotional and sweet; but be forewarned that King's work always has sharp teeth."

The concept of the parallel universe and going back in time has of course been addressed by authors in the past (notably Time and Again, which King references in his notes).  However, the idea of changing history by going back in time has never been applied to such a pivotal event as the assassination of JFK.  This story is told so deftly and the subplots that are interwoven with the main story line are just as intriguing.  It all builds to a crescendo, and what made it SO much fun to read is that I really couldn't guess the outcome!  Fantastic read! Don't miss it!"

What happened to the author of 'The Shining', 'The Stand', 'The Bachmann Books'? Well I guess he just came back. I think that this book will be considered Stephen King's masterpiece. I am not sure if those who do not remember the assassination of Kennedy will ever realize how truly traumatic this was. Even the protagonist of the novel is born too late to realize it. But he learns. The hard way. I read this entire novel in two days and loved every minute of it."

In only 4 days, I had completed an amazing adventure.  As a longtime King fan, I thought \"The Stand\" was his masterpiece. Now, I'm not so sure.  Few books have made me as emotional as I became reading this book.  The ending is pure magic. With tears in my eyes, I realized the perfect story of Jake and Sadie was at an end. Only one problem for me now...finding a new book to read after this great story!!! Nothing will measure up!!"

I remember exactly where I was the day President Kennedy was shot -I was in my last period in Mr. Shippey's biology class.  We were let out of school immediately, and my family was glued to our tv set the entire weekend.  I love the rich details of this novel and the development of the characters.  Kudos, Mr. King.

The owner of the diner convinces him to go back, wait 5 years and stop the Kennedy asassination. The book was well reasearched, the concept was not new but well played out. I liked the ending.

His treatment of time travel has a unique slant, but is internally consistent and isn't too gimmicky. King's stories always start out well, though occasionally fizzle out (most notably It.) This one keeps up the pace and I particularly liked the way he ended it. One of his best endings. He even throws in a nod to It, when his main character encounters some of the kids from It. Overall, excellent."

For the first time ever I wanted to go to the last pages to see how it ended before I finished it. Maybe Stephen is mellowing in his old age but this effort was by far his best. He is known for his out of this world stories with horror being the key ingredient. This story had substance, great story line, you name it. It was hard to put down. Congrats on a great effort."

I say it's because I am incredibly creative and have a vivid imagination--I have to blame it on something.

Although that era is history to her, to me it is like yesterday. Not only is the concept of time travel interesting to me, for it to be served up ala King made 11/2/63 a must-read. I finished this book minutes ago, and it did not disappoint. Once again I not only fell in love once with King's inimitable style and sense of story but was impressed by the maturation of his writing; I've been a King reader since the beginning. I had fallen out of the habit of reading fiction since I began writing a memoir around the turn of the century and penning another book since that time. Born in 1942, 11/22/63 was a stepping back in time for me, as my memoirs would be for Mr. King. I recommend this part-time for anyone who lived through the 50s and 60s and anyone who is interested in going back to visit that era, only with feet planted firmly in their world of today."

I love time travel novels, and this one is now in my Top 3: Time and Again, Time Traveler's Wife, and now 11-22-63. Each had a great story at its heart, each was a love story with a fabulous romance, and in each case, a reluctant hero thrust into the role of a super hero by the fact that he knows what will happen next. Such great stories, and of these, 11-22-63 is The Best. It is an addictive page turner. Five stars!"

I was 22 when JFK was assassinated and I will never forget that awful time.  This book brought all of those events into a mesmerizing story that I could not put down. I personally think there is no other writer out there with Mr. King's ability to frame a story with his incredible use of language. I laughed and I cried reading this book and felt like I was back in 1963 again. I strongly recommend this book for those who lived through those times and especially for those for whom it is only history."

I have read a number of King books previously and the reason I keep coming back for more is that I think he is unparalleled when it comes to creating and sustaining memorable characters and places. The biggest compliment I can pay this novel is that I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book but simultaneously I dreaded reaching the conclusion as it would mean the end of my time in the world of the story.  As a testament to King's storytelling skills he succeeded in making me feel nostalgic for a time and place that I have never inhabited. One criticism I would have of other King novels is that I am rarely satisfied with the endings, however, I think this one is perfect. Prior to 11.22.63 my favorite book by King was 'The Stand' but this one has definitely replaced it at the top of the list."

There was the feeling of something hovering just out of sight that was threatening, but the story played out, beautifully, with only that feeling of threat, until it came to bear. King is still a master wordsmith, and he unravels the characters and the story masterfully. I loved this book, but there is so much I can't write into a review without spoiling it. Just understand -- there is no killer clown, no Randal Stark-- the villain is much more complex and more troubling in the end. I was enjoyed the hell out of this, in spite of it not being horror."

                "Text": "In my ignorance I had always assumed that all Stephen King books were horror-themed.  Horror does not float my boat so I had never read any of his books. However, I had heard he was an astonishingly talented writer.  11/22/63 showed me that in every line of every page.  It is a brilliant idea, executed impeccably by a writer who I can only assume is 'at the height of his powers' (an overused but totally appropriate phrase).  From the arresting title...to the brilliant premise... to the expertly navigated minefield of time travel writing...to the characters and their relationships it is all utterly absorbing. I defy you not to be moved by the dance scenes and a certain re-imagined newspaper headline.  At the end of my copy, the author describes how he thought about writing this book 40 years ago.  He decided against it because of the huge amount of research involved and the fact that, 9 years after JFK's assassination, it was still too raw.  I also imagined a further reason (apologies for putting words in your mouth, Mr. King!) - a massive amount of confidence (in his writing and his premise)  and a full life of relationships and world events experience have elevated this book way beyond what it might have been 40 years ago.  I was intrigued, enthralled, moved, scared, addicted, educated, and just plain old entertained."

Ive been a King fan for years and I'm still amazed at his seemingly limitless imagination. 11/22/63 is a fascinating trip through the past and a jaunt down memory lane for those readers who grew up during this time period. I found myself longing to travel back myself to a period before computers, internet and electronic gadgetry. I did have a hard time trying NOT to read into the underlying political views that I'm not sure are just a fabrication of the story line or perhaps a bit of Kings own personal beliefs. Either way this book is a must read and one you will have a hard time putting down if you are a Stephen King fan."

                "Text": "\"11/22/63\" is probably my favorite Stephen King book ever.  As a teenager I devoured his books, even doing a final class report comparing one of his short stories against an HG Wells story.  My other favorite book of his is The Stand, which is an amazing journey through an entire universe, similar to this story.  I had not picked up any of his books in many years, but what a return.  His tone and pace of storytelling was familiar and great to revisit, and I was pulled into the world of this story quickly and had a hard time putting the book down.  It made for great reading while I was spending a lot of time on airplanes as I was transported to another place literally and figuratively.  If you enjoy a fully engaging story with intense characters, and aren't afraid of a long read, I highly recommend this book."

                "Text": "In the search for a good book to read, I fell prey to the marketing hype before this book was released.  The order placed on Amazon, I decided to read another Stephen King book while I was waiting for the release of \"11/22/63\", so I ordered \"Under the Dome\" as a time filler and to get me in the mood for \"11/22/63\".  Unfortunately, I gave up on \"Under the Dome\" about 1/2 way through, because it was too ugly, gruesome, depressing, and too vividly portrayed man's inhumanity to man. \"11/22/63\" finally arrived and sat unread on my Kindle as a result of my experience with \"Under the Dome.\" When I finally started \"11/22/63\", I was carried away by it and could not put it down.  The writing was classically, beautiful Stephen King's writing, with a plot and story line that captured me and would not let go.  After more than a thousand pages, I was still not ready for it to finish. For me, this was a beautiful love story woven around time travel and vivid characters set in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  I believe that this is a book that Stephen King fans and non fans alike will relish.  After all of Stephen King's successes, he certainly doesn't need to prove that he is one of the best story tellers ever to entertain us, but he proved it again with \"11/22/63'. I do hope he keeps on proving it as long as he can."

I was impressed that King was able to maintain his characteristic tense, fast-paced writing style even here. The final ~250 pages in particular were very \"edge of your seat.\" I actually finished the final third of this novel in one sitting because it was so riveting. Great pacing, great historical accuracy, and a great story make this book worth 5 stars in my opinion."

There was one spot where it slowed down a little more than my liking, but for the tone and style of the book, it did a surprising job of pulling me through most of it. It's told in first person, which is pretty rare these days - and I thought it worked brilliantly. It has such a personal feel because the protagonist is the narrator. I bet first person is going to come back. Don't believe me? Ever heard of a novel called The Hunger Games? Yeah I thought so :) I really cared about these characters. I think King's biggest strength is writing good characters. I didn't know how he was going to end this huge story leaving me satisfied, but he did - and he did it in a way I wasn't expecting. I liked this book so much, I know it is one that will join the few books I will most certainly go back and read again someday. If you've never read King because you're not a horror fan like me - you owe it to yourself to give this one a try. I think you'll find that there's a reason Stephen is the King when it comes to speculative fiction. Also, I wasn't too sure about the narrator Craig Wasson at first, but as the story came alive through his voice it grew on me to the point where I can't imagine another voice telling this story. He has the perfect voice for the main character, and his accents were great too! I really enjoyed his read of this amazing novel."

Nobody can paint a picture of the 50's and 60's like Stephen King does with his love of the cars and music from that era.  He also shows how far we have come since then with the ignorance and prejudice of the time, although we still have a long way to go.  I was sucked in from the first few pages and enjoyed not just the idea of the time travel but what was also a true love story that I didn't know Stephen King had in him.  I won't provide anything that will be called a spoiler but will say if you enjoy the classics like The Shining, Salem's Lot, Christine, The Dead Zone, and The Stand....I put this up there with those titles.  It was probably the best money I have spent on a book in years."

However, in vehicle, much more difficult as the \"skip\" function recognized only the 4 main divisions of the CD.  One would have to manually \"fast forward\" through hours of real time data to find stopping/starting location.  I routinely do most of my listening in car on commute to and from work, however, I ended up listening to this primarily via computer.  Nice to have only one disc.  Great book!"

                "Text": "11-22-63 By Stephan King A delightful book with a strong main character that Mr. King is known to write. There is a spot in an old dinner in Lisbon, Main - Al's Dinner, that when you go through it, it takes you back to September 9, 1958 at 11:58a. Same time, same place each time you entered it. No matter how long you were gone, you were only gone two minutes in 2011. Al Templeton showed it to Jack Epping, English teach at the local high school and a valued customer. Al was dying of lung cancer and couldn't finish the task he had set himself. After years of using the portal to buy low cost meat for his dinner, and taking vacations - because he was only gone two minutes in Lisbon of now, he would take two weeks or a month's worth of time off in 1958 - he got the idea of changing history, now he wanted Jack to complete the task for him. Live in the past, from September 9 th , 1958 to November 22 nd , 1963 and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Jack went back for a little over a month to do his own experiment, stopping a man in Derry, Main from killing his wife, two of his sons, his daughter and injuring his youngest son with permanent brain damage and a limp. Being the fall after the deaths caused by Pennywise the Clown, there was still an air of mistrust and evil around the town, and the evil was centered at the Kitchener Ironworks, which he was sent to inspect as part of his cover of a real estate broker. He knew of this homicide because one of his adult education students was the surviving son, his essay of The Day that Changed My Life had made Jack cry as he read of the horror of that Halloween Night as Frank Dunning took drunken revenge on the wife that had kicked him out of her house for beating her and the children. He was a little late, and Frank killed his wife Doris and injured his oldest son. When he got back to 2011, he took Al home and when back to his house and slept 14 hours. When he got up he researched the son he had saved, he found that he had died in Vietnam because he had a guardian angel and took more chances that he would have without seeing Jack there that night and having him say to him \"I am your angel, I won't let any harm come to you.\" Jack went to tell Al that the experiment was a failure, to find that Al had died in the night, leaving him a note that he had to finish the task. So, Jack went back, and killed Frank Dunning two weeks before that fateful night and then went on to save a young girl from getting shot and paralyzed (Al big experimental task) and then went on to find a time to kill Lee Harvey Oswald and find the proof needed that he was the only one in on the conspiracy. This book as we moved into Lee Harvey Oswald life was so full of various historical facts about all the players of that fateful day in American history, that I was sent looking up players and facts to make sure they had really accrued and to find out more about them. Mr. King followed Mr. Oswald's life pretty accurately from the time he got to Dallas. The delight to this reviewer in this creation of Mr. King's was the fact that the history was so vividly written, and the facts woven into a story so gripping that you couldn't put it down until your eyes refused to stay open and see the page any longer. A world of shifting time lines, fact and fictional characters woven into a beautiful piece of work that you want to enjoy more than once. Mr. King wove through this story a beautiful romance that broke your heart, not once, but twice as the lines shifted and moved again. This story is a definite read for anyone who loves Mr. King's works, not horror, but delightful story with mystical paranormal elements that will keep you guessing to its outcome. A compelling read for anyone that loves history, and is interested in the players surrounding the JFK assassination. I give this book a five star rating for the thoughts and reasoning behind one man's task at saving the world. As Mr. King put in his explanation, this is one possible outcome and theory or what might have happened that day, and if that day had never happened."

My mother bought it for me as a present as she was reading it and loved it. Once I started to read I couldn't put it down. Even though it's not usual Stephen King, I think it's one of his best. I couldn't believe how well-researched it was and the story is amazing. I found the political history as interesting as the story about Jake Epping, the main character. Highly recommended!"

I, for one, am not a big book reader to say the least. Usually when I start to read a book, I lose interest. That, however, was not the case with this book. I was truly captivated throughout the magnificent journey that is this book. It took me about four weeks to read it, as I have a very busy schedule with not a lot of downtime. I must say that my next Kindle purchase will probably be a King book. His character building is phenomenal. I do not know how this particular book stacks up against his other works, but I cannot emphasize enough how much I truly enjoyed this book. I will say that I made time to read the last 100 pages in one night. I just couldn't put it down. I am pretty sure that this would be a box office smash if it were ever made into a movie. Of course, a lot would rely on the cast of characters and director."

True to the publisher's notes, this has very little to do with science fiction and everything to do with history and its impact. It is highly readable, very modern, with a story line that has something for everyone.  I think the novel is especially relevant for those who were alive and cognizant during the fifties and sixties.  I also believe that King has concluded in a way that is natural and necessary, not particularly how we might wish, but how it had to be.  I just could not put it down. I wanted to dole it out in small doses, but I was too greedy for the next chapter."

                "Text": "There is only one time travel story - the protagonist travels forward/backward in time and ends up affecting his own real time - sometimes intentionally but more often as an unintended consequence.  What a delicious twist Stephen King has given us on this theme!  Those of us who lived through it recall those glamorous days of the Kennedy Administration as Camelot, a time of wholeness, happiness and innocence.  King takes us back to those glory days, but exposes the hidden underbelly of political division, sexual hypocrisy, racism and paranoia that permeated Camelot as a result of rigid ideologies, evolving male/female roles, Jim Crow laws and the creeping Cold War.  America's dreams were dashed on 11/22/63 by a grandiose pipsqueak named Lee Harvey Oswald, who in all probability was the lone gunman who assassinated JFK. Our protagonist Jake Epping/George Amberson seeks to prevent that tragedy and change the course of history in order to save young soldiers who would certainly be \"invited to put on uniforms, fly to the other side of the world, spread their nether cheeks, and sit down on the big green dildo that was Vietnam.\" In the course of his journey to Dallas for that fateful date, our paladin finds other wrongs along the way that need to be righted. . .only to find that \"the past is obdurate; it doesn't want to change.\"  And what he is able to affect against the intractability of history, creates all manner of unintended consequences.  Jake's journey through the time travel wormhole is a nostalgia trip with a bracing dose of stark realism, a thrilling journey, a touching love story, and a rueful acknowledgement that the past is obdurate.  It doesn't want to change-- and there may well be good cosmic reasons for that.  The book is unputdownable."

I was pleasantly surprised that it kept me fully engrossed throughout.  In fact, the last half of the book which focuses on the Kennedy/Oswald storyline was a page-turner for me.  I finished the last 400 pages in a day.  The characters are well developed.  The time travel aspect (always a fun topic for me) was well presented.  Although there is some violence throughout, it is fairly tame in that regard when compared to some of King's other more \"horrific\" works.  In other words, don't avoid this because you don't like the horror genre.  This one is different and offers something for almost everyone."

It is a look into the past, and the moments that led up to Kennedy's death. It is a glimpse at how different the world could be if the JFK assassination was prevented. King did an incredible job as always. I was drawn into the story and had a hard time putting this book down. I finished this book far faster than any other 800+ page book I've ever read. King has a way of describing the past that puts you right there with him. As a child of the 80's, going back to the 50's was an exciting adventure. I could almost taste the root beer at 'The Fruit'.

                "Text": "This has been said many times; \"Stephen King has done it again.\" However, I think this truly is his crowning achievement. He took one of the most darkest events in the history of America and turned it into an epic journey combining actual events and people along with fictional events and characters. The story beings with the main character, Jake Epping (I love how the last name describes him. Epping meaning he goes on an Epic journey), a high school/GED teacher who's friend, Al Templeton owns a diner that has a time portal in it's pantry. The time portal transfers anyone who walks in there to September 9th, 1958. Al who is now sick and dying of lung cancer asks Jake to go back in time to prevent the Kennedy Assassination. After Al briefs him on how the time portal works and how to be careful in the past, Jake agrees to carry on the mission not only for his dying friend but for America itself. Not only does Jake, who now goes by the name George Amberson in the past try to prevent JFK's death, he also prevents other past dangers from happening while also making a new life for himself. On the book jacket of this book, it tells us that the story portrays time travel as more realistic. This book surely does. I won't go into detail on how because those who haven't read it yet need to read it for themselves. The things that I really like about this book is how King has actual people interact with fictional characters. I also like how detailed the book is. In other words; there's an explanation for everything. Probably my most favorite part of the book is the price. The price for saving a person's life. I won't give any spoilers away but I will say this; saving John F. Kennedy's life. Those who were living in 1963 remember how sad and unsafe they felt but, what would have happened to the country had he lived? I know that most people like to believe that the country would have been much better off but where's the real proof to that? Of course, no one has the answer to that question but just look at the possibilities. Look at what JFK did between the years of 1961 and 1963 and look at the future. Think; \"How would he have done that differently?\" Anyway, Stephen King's 11/22/63 is a masterpiece. Although he is known to being the Godfather of Horror, I believe that this is his true masterpiece! My only criticism of the book is this; why did it have to end? Was an ending really necessary?"

The characters were ones you easily fell in love with.  I even shed a few tears throughout the book.  I really loved the history and nostalgia of the story.  I will say, the book was quite long but was well worth it to develop the characters and story.  Again, I recommend this for anyone who wants to be transported back in time and want to enjoy a wonderful story."

My major in college was history, so of course when I saw this was coming out I preordered on my kindle.  I was absolutely stunned with how King made the 50's and early 60's come alive.  I was reading it on my iPad as well as my kindle even though it is much easier on my eyes to read the eink.  I just couldn't put it down so when I had my iPad out to check email or something I couldn't resist going on the app (telling myself I'd just read a few pages rather than go upstairs to my bedroom to retrieve my Kindle)and of course then I was hooked.  I'm just in awe of King's talent and imagination and was really sorry when I finished the book.  I haven't read a lot of King, but I enjoyed Under the Dome, and liked 11/22/63 even more.  Worth every penny."

And, to me, that's the point - he creates worlds and characters that will never, ever exist, but while you are reading they do exist.  His greatest gift is making the unbelievable, well.... believable.  I read a lot and, unfortunately, find a great many books that once started can easily be put down and ignored for a few days.  Not a King book.  I bought this book the day it came out and tried not to start reading it for 3 whole days because I had a big rescue animal fundraiser to get organized.  No luck - I started and read all night.  One other thing - while I love that he writes long, long, long stories I nearly dislocated a shoulder reading \"Under the Dome\" - so I was really glad I got a Kindle last Christmas, much easier to hold!"

Even the great Stephen King has written some real duds in my opinion, but I'm pleased to tell you that 11-23-63 was storytelling at it's very best. There's a reason why it is a unanimous #1 best seller. Mr. King's style of writing has always been compelling but somewhere along the way he usually loses me. It's mostly as a result of pushing the limits of my imagination too far or overdosing on horror for horror's sake. I can suspend reality but only so much. But this is not a horror story in the traditional sense. In this book, even though the concept of a rabbit hole or rip in the fabric of time is completely fantastical, I didn't care. By the end of the book the way our protagonist Jake (George) moved between time was secondary to the missions he was trying to accomplish and even the most diehard theoretical physicist wouldn't question the science and would instead enjoy a very good story. It had just the right balance of action, mystery, romance and character development. Although there were a few holes and some better explanations were needed for the existence of some of the characters, like the yellow card man, this is simply Stephen King at his very best. Another minor nitpick I have is the drawn out ending. About halfway through the final chapter I was beginning to think it was a bit unnecessary, but then Mr. King wrapped it up perfectly. It's one of those rare works of fiction that ended in just the right way so as not to suggest a sequel. Stop reading reviews and just get the book. You will enjoy it if you keep an open mind."

                "Text": "I don't read much fiction; I probably should read the stuff more often. This book reminded me of what a pleasure it is to read a good yarn that causes you to keep turning the pages until sleepiness forces you to put it down for the night. I've never been much of a fan of the time-travel gimmick in story-telling, but King makes it work as well as could be expected in this story. His descriptions of 1958 and succeeding years ring true to my own recollections. Only a couple of anachronistic clunkers come to mind, such as having one of the characters from \"the Land of Ago\" talk about the Chicago Bears winning the \"NFC\" (there was only the \"NFL\" back then; the NFC and AFC were not created until the NFL-AFL merger of 1970.) King is excruciatingly detailed in describing physical injuries that people suffer as a result of accidents or assaults, perhaps drawing on his own experience of being run over by a motor vehicle. He always excels at the small details in his descriptions. I don't think his usual feel of authenticity quite comes through in his descriptions of love and sex scenes, which are fairly ordinary and predictable. I always have felt King is better at short stories and novellas than long works like this, but there's only a few spots where this one lags; this may be because the very nature of the storyline propels the book forward to its inevitable climax. Certainly I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun read, especially anyone who - like me - has personal memories of 11-22-63 and all the speculation and conjecture that followed."

When he is doing his best work, though, it's hard for me to find someone who is a better storyteller. And like any great author, occasionally a masterpiece lands. This is easily one of his best novels ever, which is saying it's one of our best novels. Understand, you could not pay me to read anything about the Kennedy Assassination. I avoided this book for months, then started it, then put it down after about 40 pages, because I couldn't work up the energy to read about 'Oswald and ghosts' to quote Woody Allen. Finally, months later, I picked it up again and made it a little farther. One particular event happened and I was sucked in. I then tore through the first two-thirds, I was so entranced, then went slow in the final third because I didn't want it to end. It's that damn good. And while it certainly deals with the assassination, it is about so much more! The characters are wonderful and real, you care about them deeply. Where the novel eventually winds and it's ultimate points are genuinely surprising and thought-provoking. I cried a number of times in the final sections and was deeply, deeply moved. If certain critics and award circles could get over their haughtiness about populist authors, this could be the book that wins King some top awards. He deserves it for this. It's that damn good."

                "Text": "I am a sucker for time travel. I have read most of the \"must reads\" for that genre, except the \"Dark Tower\" series by King. My son, a Stephen King fan, is enamored with DT, and has told me I \"have\" to read it, but he also loves \"Memnoch the Devil\" by Anne Rice, and I just couldn't get into that one, so I will just stick to what I know. Having said that I will admit that Stephen King's horror is often a bit much for me. I loved \"Bag of Bones\" until the horror kicked in, but I do love \"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\" and \"Green Mile\", and cherish them as favorites. I eagerly anticipated the release of King's latest, a novel exploring time travel and the possibility of changing history on November 22, 1963, and felt that I could overlook the horror to get a dose of my favorite fantasy - time travel. I wasn't disappointed. Like many other reviewers on here, my productivity level dropped to zero while I was hungrily consuming this tale. I kept my Nook (sorry Amazon) with me at all times - in the laundry room, in the kitchen, at work at my desk, in my bed. Could this be harmonics? - my final pages coincided with a special about \"The Lost Bullet\", and one man's desire to know who fired that first shot, and what happened to it. As we were watching the re-enactments, John F. Kennedy, the First Lady, and Governor Connelly, were in the motorcade, traveling the streets of Dallas in time to the exact same thing I was reading! My heart was pounding during these final moments of Jake/George's harrowing attempt at changing the face of American history.  This book was long, but that was never a concern. I literally devoured the pages, while at the same time feeling sadness at approaching the end. To say I loved this book is an understatement. I can't wait for my husband to read it so that we can talk about it. I often just tell my husband the stories I read, as he's busy and not as much a reader as I am, but in this case, I want him to experience what I did. If you're on the fence about this book, or feel daunted by it's length, don't worry. Jump in! You will love everything about it - the nostalgia of life in the 50's and 60's, the wonderful characters that take up residence in your heart, and the easy-to-swallow history lesson that comes free!  My review title warns you to watch out for the \"strings\", and I can only say that you will understand that statement after you read it!  Enjoy!"

Not only was it a great story with a cast of fascinating characters but it was also historically interesting. Many times I had to stop reading and google different things that caught my interest. This was not only fun to read but educational as well about a time and a place that many of us never experienced. I am the same age as the main character and I  grew up in Dallas. I grew up in the shadow of JR and the Kennedy assassination. I have been to the grassy knoll however it never was as real as it was in king's world. One thing I must say, King's judgement of Dallas is very typical to those whose visit to Dallas is brief. Having grown up there and lived in many other cities like New York and Los Angeles I can tell you that the people are a great deal warmer and kinder than he gives them credit for and many of us Southern democrats are under represented in his book but most New Englanders with a perfunctory knowledge of Dallas would be influenced more by what people think they know about the city and it's inhabitants than what it truly is. Despite this I truly enjoyed this one and you should immediately stop what you are doing, buy this book and don't expect to do anything else for the next few days."

                "Text": "First of all, kudos to Stephen King.  I dedicated all of two weeks in reading this captivating and suspenseful time-travel of a story.  And not was I disappointed.  I don't read many of these type of stories, but when Stephen King takes on time-travel and history, I pretty much trust with my gut he's going to deliver, which he has.  Within the mist of the chaos of trying to save one of America's historical people of that time period, there is also a beautiful and yet challenging romance between George Amberson/Jake Eppings and Sadie Dunhill.  For those who are future writers of any genre, who likes to add romance to their stories, Stephen King shows you how a great one should be written.  Sadie is my absolute favorite character from the moment she enters the story to the end.  She made laugh, cry, and root for her.  As for the story, in general, if you like a good food-for-thought thriller that will keep you on your toes I'd say read this.  Even if you don't read much Stephen King.  Even if you don't know much about JFK and his politics.  This book incredibly entertaining if nothing else.  I had a blast reading 11/22/63 and Stephen King truly applies all his creative magic to this story making it one of  his most splendid pieces of work he's ever done."

In King's version, Jake Epping, a 35-year English teacher has the opportunity to go back in time and attempt to avert the Kennedy assignation.  Epping is introduced to the concept of time-traveling and the prospect of saving Kennedy by Al, the proprietor of a local diner.  Apparently there is a \"rabbit-hole\" in the pantry of the diner that deposits anyone climbing through to September 9, 1985 (always the same date).  Al asks Epping, a man whom he only knows as a customer, to \"carry on his mission\" since Al is now dying.  After thinking about this for precisely one day, Epping goes back in time and lives there for five years while he concocts a plan to stop Lee Harvey Oswald.  The story starts out well enough and then it just falls apart; it is a rambling, clich\u00e9 ridden mess where the past is romanticized/sanitized and the protagonist develops amazing (read: unbelievable) skills (spying, shooting, planning) .  Great concept, lousy execution; this book would have benefited from a heavy editing hand, 300 less pages, and two less story lines."

Hearts In Atlantis has been my favorite book of his and this one is certainly on a par. One of the things I enjoy doing after reading a book I enjoyed reading is to go back and read some of the reviews that weren't very kind to the book to contrast what they didn't like to what I did like. I read the few 1 star reviews and most of them were upset with with King for not making this a pure action book surrounding the plot of time travel to prevent the Kennedy assassination. That book would have ended up being just a pure Sci Fi book. A good one, and interesting, but not remarkable. Instead King has us travel back to the way things were in small town America for which he has an ongoing love affair. So do I... The love story between Jake and Sadie as well as the heroic characters of the townspeople from Jodie are beautiful and they give the story the depth of feeling and emotion I expect when I read the last sentence of a book. I want to feel something at the end and King has accomplished that here. It is a beautiful love story meshed with a Science Fiction premise but make no mistake, this IS a love story and a very good one at that!"

In my opinion, one of the many joys of reading Stephen King is discovering the unknown, and what wonderful tricks SK has up his sleeve this go around. 11/22/63 is one of my favorites novels, from my all time favorite author, in several years! SK never fails to deliver and always keeps the reader awake until the wee hours of night, unable to put down the book, devouring each chapter like a fine chocolate truffle! Unlike some of Mr. King's other mammoth novels, the reader will be constantly in suspense, and eager for what is next, but not terrified and checking under the bed before finally turning off the bedside light to go to sleep.  I am a Kindle owner and love downloading books immediately, but some books must be owned and held in the reader's hand. This is one of them! If you are a fan of suspense, conspiracy theories, time travel, and the \"What Ifs\" in life, you will adore this book! Happy Reading fellow Stephen King Fans... and for those who have never ventured into Stephen King's world.. this book would be an excellent place to start. Namaste`"

This is a really big book, literally, over 800 pages.  I bought the book because I had a gift certificate and if I was going to pay that much for a book I wanted the actual book not the Kindle version.  That all being said....since I'm so used to the Kindle, it was very hard for me to handle and hold this huge book.  I've been spoiled....just pushing a button...versus turning pages and holding......but, because this book was so interesting to me, I got through it and loved it.

The title gave away the book's premise and I was immediatley attracted to the time travel thing and the idea of going back in time to Dallas in November 1963 to thwart the Kennedy assassination. A lot of people probably don't have time to read a 845 page novel, but this book just draws the reader in like the time portal that is introduced to us about twenty pages into it. It's doubtful that a shorter version, trimmed by 300 pages, would have been as satisfying. Sounds like a cliche' but, literally, you won't be able to put this book down. I was doubly convinced that I had to read this book after listening to Stephen King himself being interview about this latest work of his on National Public Radio. He conveyed the premise of his novel with such intriguing detail. Years ago, upon finishing Larry McMurtney's western novel Lonesome Dove I actually felt sad to say goodbye to that story and its characters. I'm sure that I'm feel equally blue after finishing King's 11/23/63. Certain books are hard to say goodbye to. I highly recommend this book."

                "Text": "Since by now you will already know the premise of this book, and other reviewers have given good overviews, I won't bother with that here.  Instead, I will say that I truly believe that this is King's best work of his very prolific career.  I was a big fan of early Stephan King and his pseudonym Bachman, but stopped reading him about 10 years ago.  I felt that after his initial big successes, he sadly succumbed to \"writer's popularity\", churning out works \"on schedule\" to meet publisher and fan demands that sold merely because of his former successes.  However, I bought this book because the premise sounded so promising.  I'm so glad I did.  I quite literally could not put this book down.  In my opinion, King's earlier works were unmatched for suspense, yet his endings often left me disappointed.  I hoped that 11/22/63 would not be the same.  In this work, King has mastered it all.  His first foray into time travel has all the suspense of his earlier works and, although this is a very long book, never once did it drag. King has managed the enviable accomplishment of making every page a page-turner.  I found myself sorry to finish it."

I enjoyed the story. I loved the details of small-town life. When I read a book I like to feel like I've been everywhere the characters have been and have done everything they've done, I got that feeling with this book, and that made me happy. My only real complaint is one that I've had with several of King's books in the past. It was a little drawn out. This story certainly could've been told in less than 849 pages. The plot is not that complicated or detailed to necessitate over 800 pages. It's obviously told in so many pages because that's the way King chose to tell his story. I personally would've much rather have read the same story in 500 pages, which I think it could easily be edited down to. That's just my personal preference. It's obvious that many people love this book exactly as it is, but I grew a little weary of so many repetitious thoughts and actions that were not essential. I still thought it was a good read and enjoyed it very much."

I used to read a lot of Stephen King, and haven't read one of his books in years. I picked this one up because of the topic. I have wanted to read more about Kennedy and the assassination. While I know this is a Novel, and I didn't expect to learn any new facts about the assasination, when I think about the book from the Kennedy assassination stand point I kind of want to give this book 3 stars. I wanted a more indepth look at what the world would be like if Kennedy had lived.  The book did cover that, don't get me wrong.  I just wanted more of this.  So I found the book a bit disappointing from that stand point. But if I look at the book from a love story stand point, then I liked the book tremendously. I just didn't expect this book to be so much of a love story. From a love story stand point, this book was beautifully written, that's just not what I expected.  Overall, I liked the book quite a bit,this is one that will stay with me for some time."

He starts in 1958 because that is where the \"rabbit hole\" in the pantry of Al's diner takes him. Each time he returns to the present, he believes, is a \"total reset\" to the last outcome he created. Each time he goes, no matter how long he is gone, only two minutes have passed when he returns. These little details and King's wonderfully descriptive turns of a phrase bond the reader/listener to the story as Jake stays in the past in a count down to 11/22/63, the day Kennedy was shot. As he waits he meets the woman who will become the love of his life. Will she come back with him into the future? Will he succeed in stopping the assassination and create other changes he believes will improve the lives of others? Or is the quest he promised Al he would make more than he bargained for? Either way, you will be gripped by the journey!"

What it would be like to go back in the past, just to see what things were like in your own neighborhood in another era--or perhaps to go back, to fix your most regretted mistake in life--or even to play hero and rescue the world from some historical disaster? This book delves into a world where such things are possible. But what are the consequences? If things go as planned, will the intended result of your heroism pan out? Will even mundane occurrences in your time-traveling adventures have unforeseen costs? 11/22/63 blends fact with fantasy in a way that you will experience with all the senses. I could not help but care so deeply about the characters as to be driven to tears at times, and many others have had the same experience with it. As wild as 'historical revisionist sci-fi' sounds, this book was fascinating, fun and deeply moving. I'm finally through all 849 pages and am sad just to have to leave the fantastic, nostalgic world of this story behind. A truly valuable, though heartbreaking, experience ."

A great read should take you out of yourself where you totally identify with the characters and can't wait to know how the story comes out:  this novel delivers. I am always impressed with the richness of detail of the times and places King paints...I was swept away with Hearts In Atlantis, and that is the case with 11/22/63.  Bravo, Stephen King.  I was a young boy when Kennedy was killed, but I know where I was and what I was doing when it happened, as most Americans can attest who were alive for the event.  Thinking of what I knew and felt then is a journey through time and I feel the freshness and immediacy of the tragedy today. It's no wonder as the author points out that this novel couldn't have been written years ago when the emotional wounds were so fresh: it's time now is appropriate.  And if you were born after the assasination, this novel can fill in many feelings and events you might have missed...the story is that good."

                "Text": "I always found Stephen King's earlier works TOO realistic in their depiction of horror. But with this, and Under the Dome, he's turned a corner for me. Although both are still graphic and contain violence, especially in this novel the violence is  essential to the story. This one made me almost glad I had a head cold and had to stay in bed, because I read the whole thing in about four days and actually put myself on page rations so I could savor it. Stephen King knows how to populate an entire town with characters that you either love or hate -- and he controls which outcome is which, because of his abililty to give each his or her own personality and language. Honestly, if there is a more gifted storyteller -- one who, after a horrific accident and a hardscrabble upbringing (read his On Writing, also a wonderful book and one that has changed the way I approach the written word; no more passive voice!) knows from whence he speaks regarding suffering -- I would like them to stand up and try to write SK under the table. Ain't gonna happen!"

It's probably the longest novel I've ever read and I am not a good reader, I tend to want to pronounce each word I read so for me to read a 853 page novel is a fete in itself and I'm glad I chose this one. I am just a year younger than Stephen King, so at first, it was nostalgic to read about the 50s and 60s time period. But the concepts King has about time travel itself, is very believable and something that has stayed with me and I've given a lot of thought. I, like many Americans, lived through the Kennedy Assassination when I was 14. It was the first time I sat up and started listening to our President. I'm sure his youth, humor and good looks had a lot to do with it. So the assassination was significantly tragic to me at the time and has stayed with me through the years.I wasn't disappointed by this story. King's character development is so well done that I actually started caring more about them than the assassination itself. I highly recommend this novel."

I get frustrated, though, when I've read some of my favorite authors for a while, then read a Stephen King book like 11/22/63 for a period of time. To me, the stories are always interesting - from his accounts of the setting to the character development. I always find myself on the emotional roller coaster of rooting for the hero or turning the pages quickly to see what will happen next. Nonetheless, I get very thrown off by his writing. Perhaps it is because he writes so many novels so quickly and to such a massive audience that he reverts to repetitive word use and over-simplified language over and over again. If I had to tally how many times he had written that the past is \"obdurate\" or that it \"harmonizes,\" I'm certain I'd run out of loose leaf. Even when he was speaking in the voice of a well-educated man, he refers to a train as a choo-choo rather matter of factly. Should Mr. King or any of his circle ever read such reviews as this - PLEASE get back to that good ol' storytelling we knew so well without dumbing down the language...it's distracting!! Nonetheless, three cheers for an excellent story."

I got to say, King as at the top of his game here.  Some of his scenes set in Derry that harken back to another of his novels set in Derry are kind of cheesy, but otherwise our return to Derry is well worth the time.  I've been reading King's works since I was 10-years old when I walked to the bookstore to buy a paperback copy of \"Pet Semetery\" because my mom forbid me to walk down to the movie theater to see the film version.  So I hate to admit that his novels over the last decade haven't gripped me as much as his novels from the 70's, 80's and 90's (with the grand exception of \"Cell\" as well as his collections of short stories and novellas).  \"Under the Dome\" was pretty good compared to \"Bag of Bones\" and \"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\", but so far \"11/22/63\" has blown them all away."

No matter the story, he can bring characters to life like no other writer, and have you invested in a story and caring about the characters within the first few chapters.  That being said, this is the best book that SK has written in a long time.  I could not put it down.  I know that some people have written off Stephen King as a horror writer and can not get past the fantasy type stuff and the blood and gore that he seems to work into every book, but this book has a lot less of that than most of his writing and I think would appeal to any type of reader, even the ones who think they do not like Stephen King books.  It has so much of the personal connections and detailed characterization that I really think make SK stand out as one of the best writers of our time.  I just hope that this is a sign of more to come, and he can continue to produce books of this caliber until he is old and grey!"

You could obviously tell the time period, the politics, the music, etc. were special to him, but it made for tedious reading, in my view. There were several interesting sections, but they were short-lived. I missed the creepiness and trademark King style. Obviously this was a very different book. If you like historical fiction and don't mind reading endless details about the minutiae of day to day life in the late 50s-early 60s, you'd probably really enjoy it. The assassination of JFK and Oswald really took second place to the story of the main character meeting and falling in love with a woman in a small town. I enjoyed the time travel aspect of it, but that also seemed more of a background story that was just used as a tool to get the protagonist to that small town and the love interest."

King is able to get into the head of everyone of his characters and take you on an incredible journey of what-ifs and what-abouts. 11/22 is also my birthday so I have a special connection with JFK, this book brings him back to us in a special way.  King continues to evolve and show us his deep emotional connection to his stories that he shares as only King does, by taking you inside each characters head and helping that video that we create be real and irresistible.  Bravo Stephen King, you never cease to amaze me, and for those who dont read King because it is too scary or dark, treat yourself to 11/22/63.  You will think about this book long after you have finished reading it, another 200 pages would have been just fine."

The concept of this book seemed interesting so I thought I would try again. I was hooked from the beginning. If I don't like the characters I won't read a book but I fell in love with these immediately.Although there isn't any traditional \"horror\" in the book there are supernatural elements. The book is about so much more than trying to go back and stop the Kennedy assassination though. It is about the changes that were coming to America in the early 60's. It is about the people and the attitudes, the nostalgia we have for those times now and the reality of those times, simpler times yes but not really more innocent times. It is (I think) about what we do or are willing to do for those we love, for better or worse....but at it's basic level it's a good story and a satisfying ride."

But I thoroughly loved the time travel back to one of my passions in life - the JFK assisination.  Having been in 9th grade when that happened it's always been my \"911\"; I've read many many books on this particular subject; and though I do not agree with the lone killer being Oswald, like King does, I still found myself spellbound at times and it was one of those 'can't put down' books for me.  I love the love story that's wrapped inside this piece and was disappointed that it didn't turn out better in the end. Certainly made me think about not changing what has already happened; and like they say \"everything happens for a reason\".  All in all it's one of the best books I've read in a very long time... can't wait for the movie!  Thanks, Steven King, you're a genius!"

This is a must read for King fans and history buffs alike, and particularly so for any of us Texans, as a great deal of the drama takes place here in 1960-63. If you are not a King reader because you don't like horror, scifi, or gore- well, then this book is perfect for you because it has none of those trademark Stephen King markings. This is just an incredible novel about an average guy who stumbles upon an opportunity to go back in time and stop John F Kennedy's assassination. He embarks on this journey reluctantly because he is convinced it will change America's course for the better. Ultimately, he has a Stephen King style adventure in the vein of \" The Stand\" and even has an opportunity to experience deep and true love that endures the ravages of time."

But then he changed-or perhaps I did-it all seemed too weird, too violent, too vulgar. So I stopped reading, and just reminisced of the good ole' books such as The Stand, Misery, The Shining, the excellent short stories such as Shawshank Redemption, The Body,(inspiration for the movie Stand By Me), to name a few. Well, with 11/22/63, the old Steve is back! An incredible, clever story exploring what could happen if you could time travel and change history-in this case stop Lee Harvey Oswald from shooting JFK. A classic King book as much of the action is in small town Maine, and many references to past King books. And a love story, for a change. Fun read, historically thought provoking."

This was different and it shows that SK possesses a wide range of talent. This book provoked so many different emotions for me. You can't help but love a book that can do that. For those that gave this book a 1 or 2 star rating and are so passionately criticizing SK for this book, which in my estimation, shows his evolution as a writer.  They want traditional SK, they want the bejeezuz scared out of them. That didn't necessarily happen here. The criticism comes because these people here hate change. He's evolving and these so-called \"fans\" can't handle it. I love the fact that SK is capable of change. Most writers just dry up. I hope SK never stops writing. I am intently looking forward to his next."

I eventually had to speed read through large parts of the book (another play, another dance, another drawn out conversation with no relevance) just to get to the parts of the plot that were relevant. And plot flaws abound. A man so worried about the butterfly effect but waits years to do the one deed he wants to do at the last possible second meanwhile affecting the lives of so many. Even if he only changed the one thing he came to do, it would have probably resulted in everyone he knew in the present not ever being born. Even himself. I expected so much more thought provoking plot and much less trivial page-filling fluff. Where have you gone Mr. king?"

I read all 850 pages in three days.  It deals with time travel in a unique way and it is a fascinating and somewhat educational concept.  Like all of King's novels, he takes his time to get to the meat of things.  But every chapter had me on the edge of my seat.  I highly recommend this to SK fans.  For those of you who are not that familiar with King's writing be aware that he likes to bend reality.  Usually he is the \"master of horror.\" This book, though there are elements of horror, is more of a thriller/mystery.  It's written very well and though it's quite a hefty book, the read is easy (the cliff-hanger chapters are short).  I hope you enjoy the book."

Well thought out characters, a story that could become cliche but manages to transcend, an ending that is not a crowd pleaser but makes a whole lot more sense then a possible happily ever after. While I see some complaining about the length of pacing of this book, they obviously are more likely to read the destroyer of American words books, James Patterson, then an actual important member of the American ouevre. Looking at King's book, the greats to me or the door stoppers, \"It\", \"The Stand\", \"Needful Things\"-give King the ability to write beyond 400 pages and you've got a masterpiece on your hands in my opinion. Having to pick what some would say is not what actually happened on that day in November would to some be a weakness but for me is a strength, I'm now committed to the idea that Oswald did it, indicating how strong King's writing is. Overall a highly recommended book for anyone who likes fiction and time travel."

When \"11/22/63\" was announced, the premise did not really appeal to me, I must admit. I didn't want to read a political time travel thriller, but I purchased it anyway, as I'm a huge King fan. Boy, was I blown away! This novel, with its great first person narration and almost Dickensian prose, is amazing, the best King has written in years. And I don't think it's just that my expectations were low. This novel is wonderful. From the fast-paced opening chapters, where our hero descends from 2011 back to 1958, through the wonderful Derry circa 1958 sequences (including surprising and exciting references to, and even two cameos from, IT, my favourite all-time King), on to Texas, and the main action, this is a compelling, unputdownable tour-de-force that manages to be exciting, haunting, enjoyable, and thought-provoking. I've just now finished it and may come back to add more to this review once I allow my thoughts to settle a little more. But suffice it to say, this is now one of my favourite Kings. Very highly recommended."

I have enjoyed a number of Stephen King books in the past but in my opinion this is his best work.  The book has some very interesting ideas about the paradoxes of going back in time, a lot of fascinating research about Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy assassination, a strong romantic interest, and a moving portrait of life in the 1950s, with both its good and bad sides. It's a big book and not easy to put down, so be prepared for some long nights!"

I'm a social studies teacher, so I was intrigued by the topic from the start.  I appreciated all the research he did in bringing this story to life. I won't go into a synopsis ~ lot of good ones here. My review is more about the experience of reading this book. I have read many of Stephen King's books, but I haven't in a while, so it was so nice to hear his \"voice\" again. I found myself dogearing pages simply because of his prose. I'm here hoping to find another one of his books that will willingly suck me into one of his worlds. If I can't find something today, maybe I'll read the Talisman for the third time."

Dont be scared of the length.  I never would have made it through if not worthwhile.  He really is the master of story telling, and this one is in line with \"Stand By Me\" and \"Shawshank\".  Continual sense of supernatural forces at work, but not gross or graphic at all...Great characters and he makes the time travel issues work.  Could have trimmed the middle a bit, (very little bit) as to the surveillance of Oswald, but thats really nitpicking.  Someday, somewhere (probably in Maine) King's works will be taught as amazing literature, rather than the perception that it is \"airport reading\" pop fiction."

Spent more of my adolescence watching famous assassinations and funerals alone and wondering when the nightmare would be over. Pages 615-616. Check it out and then say the book is \"fluff.\" \"Harmonic chords?\" I'm just glad to know what to call them. \"The past is obdurate?\" Hell, yes.

SK has been on a real winning streak lately with some of the best work of his long career with two excellent collections (JUST AFTER SUNSET, FULL DARK,NO STARS) a terrific novella (BLOCKADE BILLY) and his epic UNDER THE DOME.  11/22/63 is really the icing on the cake.  11/22/63 is one of his most well written novels, ranking right up there with DOLORES CLAIBORNE and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS.  There are plenty of memorable characters and plot twists that King readers have come to expect, but there is something more restrained, mature and subdued about this novel and I think Mr. King's genious has never been more apparent.  If this one dosen't get him a Pulitzer nothing will.  The book really tugs at the heartstrings and, unlike the protaganist of this novel, I had tears in my eyes several times.  It's one of his best and King readers should be pleased.  I know you will have a fun time with all of the clever inside jokes and meeting up with some old friends from the town of Derry.  And do yourself a favor.  Buy the physical book.  This one is worth passing along to your kids someday (something you won't be able to do with a certain to be obsolete electronic book version)."

I think I would have been even happier had he added another few hundred pages and flushed out the apocalyptic end-times scenario.  The ending was gripping, but all too brief and a little difficult to fathom. (Like, how exactly were natural disasters brought about by the interference of the main character in 1963?)  The best time travel book I've ever read.  In the Afterword, King recommends Jack Finney's Time and Again, which he says is the best time travel book he's ever read.  Sadly, it seems that the book is out of print.  I'm hoping some kind publisher makes the book available on Kindle."

Don't plan to accomplish anything other than read once you start.  Impossible to put down.

The writing style seems to me to be typical King.  The story is interesting, as alternate histories can be, and reasonably well-paced.  There are a few fun, non-distracting references to his other stories, as he considers most (if not all) of them to be part of the same multi-verse.  I'm not always a fan of King's endings (let's say 50/50; and while he'd probably say they're all just \"ka,\" I think he sometimes enjoys leaving the reader as uncomfortable at the end as in the middle), but this one was satisfying."

I recently enjoyed Under the Dome, but still felt a lack of maturity in his exploration of human relationships.  With this book, King has written two beautiful, mature, love stories.  One is between Jake and  Sadie.  The other is between the author and America - both that of the 50's/60's and the present. Both are heartfelt by both writer and reader.  Even after 900 pages, I did not want the book to end. Jake is the first King character who ever made me cry - even if he had a hard time with that himself."

But what was most annoying were the many goofs and bloopers, and expressions that would not have been used in the 50's.  I found it hard to believe that young people were doing the Lindy Hop to Glenn Miller in 1958. \"Wings of a Dove\" on the radio before the song was actually written.  Jim LaDue tells Coslaw \"You Rock!\"  Someone needs to \"Man Up\".  People listening to \"Louie Louie\" in 1961. ( a 1963 song).  Also..the way that everyone speaks the same way.  Words constantly stream from the characters' mouths in a sort of clever, snappy patter.  Everyone ....Al, old ladies, bartenders, salesmen, little kids.  I was so glad when it was over."

It was great to read a book that so expertly wove a spelling-binding plot, great characters, and the cultural and political history of the late fifties and early sixties together. As I read, I kept speculating on how history would have unfolded if JFK had not been tragically assassinated and developed my own guesses. Well, all I can say is that the final chapters made the read all the more worthwhile. This Stephen King novel was both thrilling and thought-provoking at once."

From the first chapter, the book pulls you in, and if you think it is predictable - think again.  The book is a story in a story, and you do not have to be a JFK junkie to enjoy it.  The fact is, I enjoyed the parts of the book that had nothing to do with JFK and the story behind the assasination, the best.  Unlike most King novels, there are no real horrors or supernatural occurances - just the scientific confusion associated with time travel.  King will have a difficult time surpassing this one.  I recommend it highly!"

However, due to the premise of this book, I picked it up and read it in 2 days! It's interesting, a good read, doesn't get into the usual theories of the Kennedy assassination. The reason I gave it 4 instead 5 stars is that the ending did not play for me - it was getting into the scary/gory/don't want to know details, which I associate with 'typical' King stories. Also, I agree with the assessment of Dallas - don't like it, it has a dark vibe. I'm going to try another S.K. book, soon!"

It is basically a love story between a man from the 21st century and a woman from the mid twentieth century.  The JFK story about stopping the assassination, though definitely interesting, is not the main focus of the story.  This is a gentle story that takes place mostly in the \"innocent\" 1950's and early 60's.  It also discusses what happens to the future when we change the past.  The story and quality of writing were so good, that I literally couldn't put this book down!!"

But Stephen King's superior writing style, imagination, diction, imagery, characters, and ability to weave rich and intricate detail into his stories always has me on the prowl for one of his non horror books (if you're like this, also check out Eyes of the Dragon, another of my fave King novels). This one was fabulous and i devoured it in a few days. Fantastic read. Loved the allusion to harmonizing which refers to another of his stories ;-)"

The time travel aspect was of particular interest to me, and King handles it beautifully. I strongly urge you to get this book, but if you are like me and buy the Kindle version, you will find yourself reading this book at every spare moment you have (in bed, while cooking, on the subway, etc, etc)."

Much about the past is good and nostalgic and simpler and better, but the past has a dark side as well. A very interesting \"what if\" scenario that plays out logically and satisfactorily.

If you could go back in time and change something that you thought would make the world better, would you?  It is a great premise and while the answer is not what you'd expect, I wonder if we applied it to 09/11/01, would you do it?  I think I might, but then we never know the consequences of different actions.  If string theory is a fact, this book is a powerful argument for pausing to reflect before deciding, even in theory."

Nice work of fiction but it would have been truly inspirational if a mind as fertile as his would have left the ages something more than this about \"our 9/11.\" He was certainly capable of it; it's a shame he turned away from the abyss and left a message saying that it isn't there."

The book is about 1000 pages long, and I wish it was 2000 pages, it is that good. King does a great job of capturing the 60s and the chaos in and around Dallas. If you are looking for a great book for yourself or to give to a friend, look no further."

I have to say this is one of his best and one of the best stores I have ever read.  Great writing, characters so real you think you knew them in real life, great twists and turns and a satisfying ending.  King seems to be finding his groove again which is awesome.

The plot is intricate, the characters are ones we come to care a great deal about, and it's a page-turner in the best sense of the word.  It's ironic, but I think King's best work are those novels and stories where he dials down the supernatural and concentrates on the human condition.  He has obviously gotten better with age, and 11/22/63 is truly not to be missed, even by non-fans.  Very impressive."

This is certainly an exciting and wonderful read - just had a hard time holding the book up in bed!"

The time-travel story was very good and I admire the scope of the project, but I just couldn't get past the writing (my apologies to Stephen King and all his fans --- I used to be one myself).  Even though I read nearly 300 pages, I still didn't have a handle on even the main character.  The dialogue seemed artificial and stilted and no one \"came alive\" for me.

The information researched about Lee Harvey Oswald's life leading up to the assassination of Kennedy makes a great backdrop for playing with time travel.  Kennedy's assassination is one of those pivotal moments that people pick in a discussion over time travel and changing the past.  The main character was engaging and the narrative kept me wondering where exactly King was going.  The end was satisfying and not totally predictable."
