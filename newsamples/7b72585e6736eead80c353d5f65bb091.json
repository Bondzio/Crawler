                "Text": "I picked up this book to review statics and mechanics of materials and found it missing much fundamental information on the subject.  No mention was made of the concept of Mohr's Circle which is useful in visualizing computation of combined stress states.  The solved problems tend to be inadequate in explaining the subject.  It was helpful however to have statics and mechanics of materials in a single text (a bargain buy!).  Pick another text to either learn or review this subject."

                "Text": "The book isn't overall bad, but the explanations assume a strong comprehension of the subject. As for statics and mechanics, it is merely a few select cases, and fails to actually help.  Several vital steps are omitted outright, so you'd be better off skipping this book, and searching for a question and answer bank."

                "Text": "Good for clear well set out examples of problems and supplementary problems to attempt. Ideal for students studying for exams and doing assignments or for old guys who never did engineering and who want to be able to calculate the forces on a truss and maybe a few other things like buckling force on a column. I may supplement with another text with more detailed explanations of theory and pretty diagrams for this topic. It has some programs in Fortran do more lengthy problems. I actually did a truss calculation problem by hand that the book specified to use the program because it was a typical truss you might find in a house frame.  Being Australian I would have preferred all metrics in problems. Also you probably couldn't run with this book if you hadn't done a lot of tertiary maths. I have used this book to get a better understanding of civil engineering problems just to help me understand the BCA and AS1684 timber framing for prescriptive design in Australia homes. I wanted to be an owner builder in the future. Not sure it will happen but at least with books like this I might be able to calculate suitable sizes for steel or timber fink truss in a house which AS1684 doesn't cover for example in its tables."

I re-purchased the series for my son, who is also majoring in mechanical engineereing.  He, too, finds the booklet very useful."
