                "Text": "This is a very good book both for the layman and for physics undergraduate majors such as myself who have forgotten most of what they learned 20 years ago. In addition...without using any sophisticated math it explains basic concepts of particle physics and also presents the latest theories and discoveries. It is certainly too basic for current graduate level physics students, but for the overwhelming majority of people this book gives a wonderful overview of a fascinating field of science. Those with any curiosity concerning physics should enjoy this book."

                "Text": "When reading books about Chemistry or Physics, the level of depth is usually to the electron, proton, neutron, and there is usually some mention of quarks and antimatter and dark matter, but with no explanation of where these ideas are coming from. This book gives a good, nonmathematical description of the Standard Theory (Model) of particle physics, which gives a good account of what particles are known, how forces are treated using particles called Bosons. The books will answer any questions about what is known, but without proofs. I plan to study physics as an undergrad, and probably grad too, and have always been attracted to learning about the fundamental particles. This book was very satisfying for me, and will be for other interested students. Kane provides information about not only the standard theory, but also the facilities where research is done, where the field is going, and what a future student can expect. A quick read and definitely worth the time!"

                "Text": "A very good book describing the search for fundamental particles and a theory to unify the four known forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong).  Dr. Kane takes a philisopical approach at times, such as when he describes the three different ways in which we \"understand\" things.  He provides an adequate history of particle physics but does not dwell on it, instead focusing on progress made to date.  I found the book very enjoyable to read."

                "Text": "Nice to learn about leptons, up quarks, electron neutrinos, muons, Z bosons and other things I heard mentioned and wanted to learn about.  The chapter on the Standard Theory of Physics was the best chapter of all.  I give him credit for for explaining something abstract so a non scientist like me can learn it.  Even though the book was written in 1996, it is still relevant.  I also like the fact that he didn't talk about theories with multiple universes or ones with strings in many dimensions that I read about before, and are just unproven speculation.  Even though there is no math formulas, it's not light reading, but not overly difficult if you want to put in some effort.  It was well worth it.  Nice to learn about something I've been curious about.  I also recommend going to Wikipedia, typing in Particle Physics, saving the purple, green, red and yellow chart of all the particles and printing it full size on an 8 1/2 by 11 inch piece of paper to help in your understanding."

It is written to be used and understood by the average intelligent individual.  The author makes physics understandable and helps the reader become acquainted with the development of the discipline and with the various particles discovered so far.  It is for serious inquirers, however, since while the author avoids the more complicated mathematical formulas he does insist on giving accurate technical details.  This is not a story book, not fiction, not designed for light, relaxing reading, but the serious inquirer will be impressed and informed."
