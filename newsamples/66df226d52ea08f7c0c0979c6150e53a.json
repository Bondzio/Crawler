                "Text": "This book is not as useful to me as the Major American Universities Ph.D. Qualifying Questions and Solutions books, however it still provides adequate examples of problems in most of the major disciplines within the field of physics. The book is organized such that the problems are presented in the first ~half of the book, and the rest of the book is dedicated to detailed solutions.  I would prefer that problems and solutions be printed together on the same page, however this setup is satisfactory."
