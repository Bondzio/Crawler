                "Text": "What drew me to this book was not so much its title, although it is quite intriguing, but its author. I had read a couple of Professor Muller's books in the past and found them to be very engaging as well as models of clarity. This book is no exception. Using logical scientific reasoning, the author addresses various topics that a future president would likely need to deal with. The topics are: terrorism, energy, nuclear matters, outer space and global warming. Removing any mythology and misinformation that may be associated with these issues, the author carefully analyzes them from a physics perspective; this is to help any future presidents in making solid well-informed decisions. The contentious matter of global warming is dealt with particularly well; in fact, it is one of the fairest and most level-headed discussions of this matter that I have read thus far. A set of notes at the end of the book contain a few simple calculations that complement some of the statements in the main text. However, a reader who is math-phobic need to not worry since the notes are not essential to fully appreciate the book's content. The writing style is very clear, accessible, authoritative, friendly and quite engaging. This informative book can be enjoyed by anyone, especially those interested in the use of a logical scientific approach to address important world issues."

He uses the very clever device of a presidential briefing on some of the most important subjects facing humanity in the 21st century, and gives us the physics behind them. He has a very good style of writing, he explains difficult topics very well. I particularly enjoyed the section on global warming. There is so much hyperbole in the media about this subject, both from deniers and true-believers, that it is a breath of fresh air to get hard scientific fact in a low-key manner. Al Gore gets his ass handed to him in the global warming section. I have to ask myself, who am I going to trust? A physics professor or an oily, failed politician who managed to lose a presidential election that he won?"

If you have a degree in nuclear physics or nuclear engineering, you will find some things to argue over, but that is to be expected when the objective is to boil it down to the essential elements that the president needs to understand.  The book does include some math concepts, but they are explained well.  A good compliment to this book would be Ferguson's \"Nuclear Energy.\""

Although i do not agee with the last chapter on Global Warming I appreciate his honesty in explaining what the actual science is and what is hype. He supports Global Warming but addresses that it has been played up for politicial gain. I highly reccomend this book to those who are wanting to know about the sciance in the headlines."

                "Text": "While perhaps a better title would be \"Physics for Non-Scientists,\" this is an excellent book. My favorite part of the book is the discussion of the threat by global warming. Muller takes a balanced, judicious viewpoint on the issue. While believing (as I do) that CO2 has a relationship to temperature, he also criticizes the alarmists like Al Gore and the scientists who created the dishonest \"hockey stick\" graph. He also takes an evenhanded view on the subject of nuclear power. I highly recommend this book to people with a limited knowledge of physics and science in general."

                "Text": "This is a primer on energy, climate, and weapons, and is the best of Professor Muller's #1 student rated course at Berkeley. He teaches hundreds of students per year and any reader what you need to know to join the debate. He is non political, but the topic is not. He demonstrates that: electric battery cars will not save the planet because they are still too expensive (@$4.00 per gallon), that solar still has a low return on investment, that wind power is good but limited, and that the risks of more nuclear energy plants (20% of U.S. energy usage versus 70% in France) is less than advertised. The professor shows that much of our current discussion is  based on incorrect \"facts\" and sound bites, which can lead to incorrect policy. He shows that even Al Gore's graphs may give the wrong impression of \"facts\" and undermine Gore's message. Anyone that is interested in efficient use of energy, political decision making on nuclear and solar, how to control nuclear weapons, and how to be thoughtful about what to do about global warming, needs to understand the basics and basis presented here. There is not a lot of  formula work or calculations required, however I found it better to take notes as I read. If you become more interested go to itunes and get his up to 50 hours of course lectures."

It's too bad. As a former aerospace engineer, I'm still looking for a reasonable scientific explanation of why the twin towers collapsed at the rate of free fall. Jet fuel (kerosene) does not get to a high enough temperature to melt or even soften the metal of a steel structure. Even if it did soften the metal by some weird configuration, it would only have softened it in the area of impact and not the entire tower which would have had to happen for it to collapse at the rate of free-fall. I'm not a conspiracy theorist and at the same time I am still looking for an explanation that makes sense from a scientific point of view. It is clear that in this topic area, the author is either (1) sloppy in his research, (2) not competent or (3) has a strong bias that got in the way of his science expertise. It's too bad because it puts a cloud over the rest of the book. Had he left that section out, I would have given the book the highest rating. Instead I was left wondering where else there were significant errors or biases."

                "Text": "I was rather disappointed with this book for a number of reasons. First, it's not what it claims to be. This book purports to present the \"science behind the headlines\" in layman's terms, and the author repeatedly insists that he will not get into the complex math behind the science--but he does exactly that quite often. Second, it's poorly written. Maybe it's foolish of me to expect a scientist to write well (although there are some who do), but Muller often gets excited over his subject without explaining why he's so excited. He seems to think we should be excited simply because he's excited. And for a scientist--someone who is supposed to be able to understand and explain relationships like proportion and comparison, he repeatedly uses (quite annoyingly) oxymoronic phrases such as \"TNT has 20 times less power than gasoline.\" Hang on a sec--how can you claim that a multiple of TNT (20 times)--which inherently expresses an increase--is \"less\" anything than gasoline? This is a pretty basic concept--a multiple expresses something larger, or bigger, or more intense, or more valuable. Muller (or his editor) needs to learn how use percentages or fractions--pretty scary when you think that a \"scientist\" can't distinguish between a multiple and a fraction. And finally, it reads too much like a textbook. It's dull, Muller's analysis jumps all over the place, and after a few pages on any given topic, it's almost impossible to follow his meaning. And there's no real conclusion to this book. His analysis ends, and there's nothing--no summary, no conclusion, no afterword--to wrap it all up. Maybe science geeks will enjoy this book, but the layman with only a passing or basic interest in science will be bored to death. The topics Muller discusses are very important--terrorism, nuclear energy, climate change, space--but I'm sure there are better books out there on these topics. Oh, and one other thing--the whole conceit that the person reading this book will one day actually be president (Muller repeatedly addresses the reader directly with phrases like, \"When you're president, it will be important for you to know...\") gets very obnoxious very quickly."

Unlike true science he does not give an references to opposition views, if for example that the twin towers visually blowing up into pyroclastic powder was done by fire because of the energy of gasoline. His belief in terrorists is greater than his understanding of physics. Had he looked at published reports on several samples of the powder showing  microspheres formed from molten iron and the presence of nanothermite another view would have required different calculations. His and the government's pancake theory is not a possible position when the towers fell at the rate of gravity, nothing below to slow the fall required if bending steel caused the outside columns to pancake.Gasoline could not soften or melt all of the steel at the same time. Or account for the 47 core columns that would have been left standing.  The book fails to help the students think, it fosters student to not think and think they did."
