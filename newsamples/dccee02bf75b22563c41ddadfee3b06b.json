I have also read a lot of popular physics books by John Gribbin, Stephen Hawkings etc. However, I must say that I understood very little in this book. As an attempt to explain Higg's Boson and its significance to a layman it fails in its task. As a scientifically accurate document, I must say it won't appeal to someone who already knows a bit of science. In short, it fails to appeal to both the layman and the knowledgeable."

The reason this book is priced at the bargain basement price of $2.99 (Kindle) is because it is not worth a penny more and dollars less. If you are completely bored and have read every other new scientific work available, this may be a companion, but not one you're likely to ever pick up to re-read."

I'm surprised that the author has such deficient writing skills. I cannot recall EVER reading a more poorly written popular science book. How long did it take to write the 'book'? Was there any editing? My former high school teachers would have given the professor an \"F\" on this assignment!"

I underlined her forecast of 125 GEV mass of the Higgs and looked excitedly over the intervening months for further word from CERN on status of the search.  Imagine my awe at learning that very energy level is attached to the new boson!  Thank you SO MUCH Professor for providing this update to us, your thirsty audience.  I can say my toes wiggled in delight while reading this update.  Better, I actually understood the conversation, thanks to the careful explanations found in Warped Passages and her later book, Knocking on Heaven's Door.  Best of all, exciting discoveries lie immediately on the horizon - stay tuned!  Please continue to inform us, Professor, and thank you."

Predicted the in 1960s by Peter Higgs, the higgs field, mechanism and associated boson would in great part explain the masses of the elementary particles.  Lisa Randall takes a very technical subject and turns it into physics for everyone - even people who can't (or won't) do math.  No, you won't *understand* the physics involved, but you'll be able to grasp its importance and its implications to advancing the frontiers of physics in the coming years when the LHC will operate at full power.  Should you read this Kindle Short?  Well, if science to you is all about making a better toaster, then no.  You should go through life clueless about the nature of the universe you live in in.  However, if you long to get a handle of why reality is the way it is, you'll get an appreciable amount of satisfaction from reading anything that Lisa Randall writes, because she doesn't dumb down the physics concepts.  She explains the limitations of her analogies and cleans up any misconceptions that they might cause.  She makes it clear that a lack of mathematical treatment of the subject matter severely limits the depths of the subject matter, but takes care bring the mathematically uninitiated as far along as possible."

A poor balance.  The impression is that this was designed to catch the wave of excitement about the Higg's, with the priority being given to getting it out quickly, at the cost of a better, more thoughtfully written book.

Randall explores what the L-H-C experiments have provided us in the search for the Higgs boson (the mechanism that gives objects mass)  As a side benefit Randall also explains why light functions as it does..  While there are a few spots where the science gets a little hard for me to keep my head around; the book does a great job of explaining what the discovery will mean.  Until the L-H-C restarts in 2015, this is a great book to get ready for confirmation."

From the title, I was hoping to learn about \"Empty Space,\" as in does the Higgs field arise out of empty space as waves, the complement of Higgs bosons, a wave-particle duality?

The Author is careful to point out that the discovery is very preliminary and still subject to more testing before it can be announced with certainty that the Higgs Boson has been discovered, but she also points out that the current evidence is very strong, and in the range that they would expect for this particle.  She gives some brief history of the search for this particle, and discusses its importance in the world of particle physics.  Well worth the read."

Professor Randall distinguishes between Higgs field, Higgs mechanism and Higgs boson. She explains that the Higgs field is something like a type of charge spread everywhere though empty space. If space if filled up by something then it is not -empty-. First logical failure. Physicists must support logical thinking, otherwise nothing makes sense. She does not explain -how- can particles without mass interact with the Higgs field and thereby adquire mass, because a particle without mass does not exist. Second logical failure. She does not explain -how- the interaction of a pre-particle with the ''Higgs charge'' produces mass. For professor Randall, it does, and that is all. Next she writes: '...add a bit of energy, and you can create an actual particle.' How do you add a bit of energy? Who is -you- that creates a particle? No, I cannot recommend this book, it does not explain anything. Like most of modern physics, is a mere decription of some phenomena produced in collissions of already massive particles at very high relative velocities (proton-proton collisions in the CERN accelerator, for instance) but the book contains no real explanation for what are the masses, contains many logical failures, and does not explain the phenomena it describes."

                "Text": "Having read Lisa Randall's two previous books, Warped Passages, and Knocking On Heavens Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate The Modern World, I knew I was going to download this new short explication about the the wonderful discovery, 50 years after the supposition of it's existence, of the Higgs Boson, on July 4, 2012.  Now here is the thing.  Lisa Randall is a brilliant theoretical physicist, as her first two books made most clear.  It helps that she can write like a tale spinning novelist who captures you from page one and doesn't let go until the end of the book.  You simply learn about what she writes about, whether you want to or not.  That is just how good a writer she is.  But here, here, we see a different Dr Lisa Randall.  We see a human being enraptured, captured and filled with a sense of the otherworldly in how she explains what happened at CERN at the Large Hadron Collider.  You can read between the lines as she lucidly explains about the Higgs Boson, the Higgs Field and the Higgs Mechanism.  Heady stuff made crystal clear by this physicist with her heart and head in the theoretical clouds of just barely restrained excitement about the discovery and what it might portend for the Standard Model of Physics.  Or maybe not.  What it is, is this: you will easily grasp what Dr Randall writes about everything she discusses in this short, pellucid easy read.  But what I found most beautiful and extraordinary was the almost secular reverence Ms Randall has in telling all.  A delight at the possibilities and a joy in the hoping.  So, do get this lovely gem and find out why I said that Lisa Randall did it again, and aren't we the lucky ones."

Kind of looks like it was just an attempt to tap in to Higgs notoriety to raise some cash to fund another vacation in the Greek Isles, which is where the author was during some of the time the real work was going on at CERN."
