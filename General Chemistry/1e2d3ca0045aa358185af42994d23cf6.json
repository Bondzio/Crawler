I hadn't taken chemistry since high school (my previous B.S. was in the arts, not science!) so I figured I'd review the basics to give myself a head start on my classes. This book is even better than I expected. It doesn't only contain information to read, it also allows you to interact with the material, solving problems, answering questions, and working formulas. Because learning by actually doing is so effective, this book has taught me more than I would have thought possible. I now feel more prepared for my courses, and am looking for more books in this series to give me a similar boost with calculus and biology. I highly recommend it.

This book had so many positive reviews that I thought it would be a perfect addition. Well, it doesn't live up to the hype given by so many 5 star reviews. How on earth can this be titled a \"self teaching\" guide? At best, it is useful as a review of what you might learn in a chemistry class (though not nearly as in depth as most college chemistry courses require). There is very little instruction on each subject (usually only a brief paragraph, if that) then a quiz immediately after. I was expecting a more in depth review of material and then maybe a quiz at the end of each chapter. While this book might be useful, I am so happy that I also decided to get the Homework Helpers Chemistry book. THAT book is actually written in a flowing, logical, in depth manner that makes learning each step more coherent for the new chemistry student.

I began researching how other people had passed the test and ordered several materials. After 8+ years of no chemistry, my chemistry knowledge was not very good, so I had to prepare more than someone who just finished a high school chem or college intro chem course. If you are starting from scratch or just want to make sure you pass this test, then this is what I would recommend. Begin with the Wiley, \"Chemistry Concepts and Problems: A Self Teaching Guide.\" This book is written in a continuous question and answer format that reviews and tests your knowledge to build a strong foundation of chemistry knowledge and problem solving. Then simultaneously study REA's \"CLEP Chimistry,\" by Peel (I strongly recommend getting the book and CD with two practice tests included) with the Chemistry CLEP Professor software. You will find the REA book to be very summarized. I bought that first and felt like I needed more help. I found the CLEP Professor and gave it a try. My comprehension and retention immediately began skyrocketing, in addition to my practice test scores! The CLEP Professor follows the exact format and order of information of the book, but fills in a lot of the gaps. You may opt to purchase a general chemistry textbook to look up additional information on specific questions, but I would not recommend studying it alone to pass. There is too much information not focused for the CLEP exam that will make you forget what you need to know. You can also research anything you need to know more about online making the textbook unnecessary. I would recommend at least one month to go through these three materials. You should plan to spend about two weeks on the Wiley Self Study and two weeks on the CLEP professor and REA book together. That will give you 6 practice tests to work on. I recommend taking one practice test while you are studying the last two materials every other day. This will show you what you are learning and what you need to learn. Spend one month and about a total of $150 and you can save two semesters of time and about $2000. You should pass easily if you follow the three steps of this program: 1-Wiley Self-Teaching Guide, 2-CLEP Professor and REA CLEP Chemistry, 3-Take practice tests and look up material you are unfamiliar with.
