This was in the 1940's. The result, 'General Chemistry', even after more than 50 years, is one of the best introductions to chemistry at the University level that I know of. I discovered this book in my sophomore year and after that I couldn't put it down. If you really read this book thoroughly, you can probably say that you have an excellent grasp of most of the fundamental principles of chemistry. Pauling's masterly style of explaining the essentials without compromising on information is unmatched. The small, simple calculations that he illustrates in each chapter are enlightening. In addition, the book is lavishly illustrated with beautiful figures by Roger Hayward. Pauling has a special knack of bringing out the flavor of seemingly boring but important topics like thermochemistry and ionic equilibrium. If you want one book that will launch your chemical knowledge on the right trajectory, trust me and buy this one. You will be enlightened by it forever.", "Helpfulness": 0.9685863874345549, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A36A9HWQ9U1IK4/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "#1,490", "Helpfulness": "91%", "Name": "A.

I found a copy at a garage  sale, best four bucks I've spent in a while.  The format of this book is  superb, basing thermodynamics on his discussion of statistical mechanics  and QM-he found it makes learning much more smooth, and I happen to agree.  If someone would get permission to update this book and not much more,  perfect general chem text for a college sequence.

The treatment of fundamentals is more rigorous than in standard texts, however it is not more difficult to follow.  Pauling's writing style, and ability to explain concepts clearly, are truly admirable.  The depth and coverage of the book are also very impressive.  While some of the nomenclature has fallen out of fashion, this is a very trivial issue when weighed against the overall quality of the text, and anyone planning a future in chemistry who cannot or will not learn the older conventions along with the new is going to have some trouble down the road anyway.  An update, or new edition would not improve the real substance of this book.  Colorful new general chemistry texts retail for approximately 10-fold the price of this fat little workhorse, and publishers would have you believe they are next to worthless when the newer new edition comes out after 2 years.  It is difficult to justify not buying this book, and if you are serious about learning chemistry, and want to learn in more depth than will be covered in your general chemistry class, then you really need to own this book.", "Helpfulness": 0.9714285714285714, "StarRating": "5", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ARFLESOGLXAFD/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #201,008", "Helpfulness": "90%", "Name": "Doc Dave", "Location": "Georgia"}}, {"Date": "on October 3, 2000", "Text": "Although Linus Pauling is a Nobel Prize laureat, his text \"General Chemistry\" can be easily read and understood by the average high school graduate.

I purchased this textbook after reading many positive reviews, leaving me curious to hear the words from the horses mouth. Although I have only read the first few chapters so far, I can say that this is the greatest inorganic chemistry textbook that I have ever read. Pauling does a beautiful job of synthesizing classic and modern physics in developing the theories of what is now known as Quantum Mechanics -- his approach is from that of pure thermodynamics, and masterfully done, I might add. Never condescending, but coming from a very different level of understanding, reading this book is like watching any master artist creating their art before your very eyes -- genius in it's raw, pure, unadulterated form.
