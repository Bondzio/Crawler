By reading through the whole entire book, one can quickly grasp the essential ideas that are key to scoring well on the Chemistry Subject Test. (Personally, however, I found the Organic Chemistry to be unnecessarily detailed)"

If they're present in the SAME amounts but HCL has a mole ratio of 2 while Zn is 1, it's HCL so the answer is 0.50g. I really dislike how erroneous this Prep book is but the topics it covers is very nice."
