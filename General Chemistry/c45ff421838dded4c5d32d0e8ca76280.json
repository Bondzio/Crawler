                "Text": "This book is very well described elsewhere. It is spectacular. But, I first saw this in Barnes & Noble and then bought through Amazon. On the B&N; version I spotted a DVD. My Amazon edition didn't come with one. Huh? On checking more closely I found that B&N; have a deluxe 'The Elements' exclusive. It costs more than this Amazon edition but the additional DVD includes an interactive periodic table and images of the elements that are capable of 360 degree manipulation. I'm not complaining, the book alone is excellent value. Anyone wanting a still more involving experience might wish to consider the B&N; alternative."

However, I must protest that after reading it in my house over a few evenings, gently, the book has practically fallen apart in my hands. The pages have become unglued from the spine. I would expect the book to hold together for longer than one reading, as it's the sort of book I'd like to browse over and over, and show my kids. I'm worried it has a half life of 100 days."
