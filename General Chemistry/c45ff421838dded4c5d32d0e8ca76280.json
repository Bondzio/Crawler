It is spectacular. But, I first saw this in Barnes & Noble and then bought through Amazon. On the B&N; version I spotted a DVD. My Amazon edition didn't come with one. Huh? On checking more closely I found that B&N; have a deluxe 'The Elements' exclusive. It costs more than this Amazon edition but the additional DVD includes an interactive periodic table and images of the elements that are capable of 360 degree manipulation. I'm not complaining, the book alone is excellent value.
