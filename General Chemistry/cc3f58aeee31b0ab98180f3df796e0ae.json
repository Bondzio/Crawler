Most of the study books are not. This book is written by an experienced AP Chem teacher, with many tips for students throughout the sections. This is one book that I will recommend to my students."

So many mainstream books advertised that they were updated for the new curriculum, yet included the old list of labs and reduced practice multiple choice to four answers.  Not much of an update if you ask me!  This book is legit.  Bare bones review of the essentials.  If you focus on what Adrian has presented here, you should be in great shape!  Helped me as a teacher to sift through the new curriculum as well!"

Test prep requires test practice.  This is not the traditional  test prep book- it's strictly content with only one or two questions per topic.  It would have been better with at least one  practice test in the book itself.  * The online practice test needs much work- FR questions instructions are for the old format.  Test does not have rigor of real  AP exams.  Questions are awkwardly  worded where diagrams clearly belong in MC.  Shy on rigorous questions relevant to particle diagrams, graphs, and charts.  Wording in some questions  was not AP style-  \"comment on\" in the free response rather than \"explain\" or  \"justify\" -the closer the practice is to the test, the better instrument it is.  \"Diagnostics \"  online are inaccurate, too broad or do not exist.  I would not give the online test to my students nor suggest that they purchase other practice quizzes at the REA site- they are out of date on content, though I would have them buy the book for reference."

Personally, I was a die-hard Princeton Review fan and loved their test prep book that was published before the change in the AP Chem curriculum.  In the PR, there was a test at the end of each unit in addition to two full length practice exams with answers AND explanations.  In this book, you'll get a couple of questions at the end of each chapter and one full length test that you must log onto a computer and take.  Not convenient, at least for me. Bottom line: If you know nearly all of the AP Chem content and need the tiniest of refreshing, then this book is for you.  If you want more that two questions per topic, go with a different prep book."
