I was disappointed that there are only a few practice questions. Test prep requires test practice.  This is not the traditional  test prep book- it's strictly content with only one or two questions per topic.  It would have been better with at least one  practice test in the book itself.  * The online practice test needs much work- FR questions instructions are for the old format.  Test does not have rigor of real  AP exams.  Questions are awkwardly  worded where diagrams clearly belong in MC.  Shy on rigorous questions relevant to particle diagrams, graphs, and charts.  Wording in some questions  was not AP style-  \"comment on\" in the free response rather than \"explain\" or  \"justify\" -the closer the practice is to the test, the better instrument it is.  \"Diagnostics \"  online are inaccurate, too broad or do not exist.  I would not give the online test to my students nor suggest that they purchase other practice quizzes at the REA site- they are out of date on content, though I would have them buy the book for reference.", "Helpfulness": 0.8, "StarRating": "4", "Author": {"ProfileUrl": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3UPUDCPE62A2T/ref=cm_cr_pr_pdp?ie=UTF8", "Ranking": "Reviewer ranking: #1,005,939", "Helpfulness": "63%", "Name": "Janell Coffman", "Location": "ALEXANDRIA, LA, US"}}, {"Date": "on June 25, 2014", "Text": "Great book!
